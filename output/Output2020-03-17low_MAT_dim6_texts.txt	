HOC HOC-ND -0.1 "The Pope is bang on. As a resident of the Caribbean, I daily see the detrimental effects of tourism on our societies. In the name of tourism, Caribbean people are becoming second class citizens in their own countries. Tourism is very much the new plantation for the Caribbean. Yet I'll admit that as small economies with not many development options, tourism is an important industry both from the standpoints of employment and export earnings. I would like to see a more wholesome tourism in the Caribbean, a tourism which does not exploit local people through paying low wages, promoting prostitution, etc, but which is based on fairness and respect for our people.  The Pope is right to speak out. The tourist industry is guilty of trying to crystallise the disparate and complicated cultures of the world into bite-sized, palatable and 'quaint' chunks for the public to devour hungrily. It's creating a dull, flat homogeny where the world is typified by patronising symbols such as whitewashed buildings in Greece and sangria in Spain. There is more to the world than this!  The Pope is absolutely right. Commercialised tourism didn't exist for thousands of years and yet the 'third world' didn't starve to death then. Maybe western countries insisting that these countries should 'modernise' and thus destroy perfectly sustainable forms of existence caused the current problems. More western exploitation and interference through tourism is not going to help!  What about all the communities that rely on tourism? How will they cope if people don't travel?  I fully agree with the Pope. I was born in a little town on the south coast where we used to go sea bathing and roam around freely. Today, the beaches are dotted with exclusive ""foreigners only"" resorts, we are afraid to let our young sons and daughters go to these beaches. A large percentage of local boys and sex workers are said to be infected with AIDS. A predominantly Buddhist country now sees half- clad westerners roaming around in holy cities and posing next to sacred statues! The people in the industry turn a blind eye as they want the dollars.  Is this the only thing that the Pope ""really"" has to worry about? Aren't there more important things happening in this world that deserve our attention? Since when did the Pope become involved in travel guidelines?  I have travelled all over the world and, I must say, some of the most beautiful places are in dirt poor countries. I am guilty of not taking in the local culture in these places. But a culture can't feed its people, is riddled with corruption, has no civic pride, and is generally an economic basket case, has no value. I see no need to spend more than a nanosecond observing it.  I'm grateful the Pope has said the whole idea of tourism has been hijacked by selfish capitalists. The people today who for example come to safari tours of Africa are not interested in learning the cultures at all but to splash money in posh hotels and beaches, exploit the local population. It is common practice to find hotels and campsites priced in dollars benefiting the rich Westerners and depriving the local population. Who then benefit are the capitalists who also happen to come from the Western world.   People go to various tourist spots for many reasons: to know more about the places they visit, to have a break from the monotonous life and to have some relaxation, to learn something new, etc. It is good to visit tourist spots. Unfortunately, some tourists fail to respect the culture of places which they visit. For example, some Westerners who visit the beaches in Goa think that they are in a ""nude"" world and go nakedly on the beaches, ask young girls/boys to give massage to them and take delight in breaking all norms. Some who visit religious places do not want to learn how they should behave.  Tourism has destroyed a way of here in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. We were once home to the largest Amish/Mennonite population in the USA, but because of mass tourism we have lost over 40% of the original Amish/Mennonite population and over 65% of what was once their land is now gone to development. It deeply sickens me how much the Pennsylvania Dutch (German) has been exploited to the extent that prediction models have suggested that by the year 2020 not only will Amish/Mennonite farms as we know them all but disappear from Lancaster county - but so will their language and their way of life.  I think that people should show a little respect for the man representing Jesus on Earth and maybe lose some of the arrogance they have and listen to this wonderful man  I've travelled all over the world and I always make a point of studying the history and culture of the places I'm visiting. I also try to learn the local language, meet the local people and become familiar with the politics and other current issues of the country. What's the point of travelling if all you're going to do is stay locked up in some ""tourist village"", or stay in a Holiday Inn and eat at MacDonald's??  The blanket statement that the Pope condemns mass tourism is specious. The substance of the message seemed to address the widening gulf between the haves and the have-nots. The Pope has always been a fervent defender of the Third World. And the statements he made were meant to draw attention to the plight of the downtrodden - ""Don't feign ignorance of your brothers plight"". If you asked the Pope, I would bet that he encourages tourism and contact between humans, what he was condemning way some resorts insulate tourist from the surrounding squalor. ""Get to know your brother and lend him a hand"" seemed to be the underlying message. Ooh, let's hate the Pope, a spiritual-leader, for trying to raise the world's consciousness. And I live in the Washington, D.C. area, and I haven't seen hide nor hair of a Catholic theme park. Unless Alan Davison of the U.K. has taken to calling churches, theme parks.  I look forward to the Pope demonstrating the sincerity of his comments by closing all the tacky souvenir shops to be found at the great Catholic tourist attractions of the world (Lourdes, Vatican, cathedrals, etc).  Travel more Pope! Exploitation? Changing cultures? Umm! Missionaries? Enough said. Think about it. Eco-tourism is an oxymoron and in the commercial world no such thing exists: all tourism activity, whether air travel, bus travel, car rental, even whale watching is environmentally destructive insofar as it increases global warming and brings closer the total destruction of the planet.  Mass tourism, I love it. Hordes of people being catered for in small isolated tourist villages that have little or nothing to do with the local culture. Eating familiar food, getting drunk, having noise at painful volumes. It's great, then I can have a holiday, somewhere else, local food, local culture, few of my fellow countrymen if any. In the certain knowledge that the mass tourists will be somewhere else!  Has the Catholic Church not just opened a multi-million dollar theme park in Washington DC... To attract tourists?  As the most widely travelled person in any mainstream religion, let alone Catholicism, in recorded history one would think that the Pope should stay silent on the subject of tourism.  It certainly has downsides. An example: Hill walking and rock-climbing took off in the UK in the early 1990s. Monied individuals with far less commitment to the activities than those already taking part go through the following Road to Damascus: 1. They have an accident due to inexperience, naivety or bad luck. 2. Mountain rescue services start getting annoyed by the unprepared nature of those who call them out. 3. Journalists then start attacking this 'death sport' on a weekly basis. 4. Responsible and experienced participants are then vilified by non-participants for their 'irresponsibility'. 5. The ""something must be done (but not by us)"" mantra begins to take over. If tourism promotes the rights of dilettantes over committed participants, without demanding a price for personal responsibility, then tourism becomes a blight. But I guess the owners of guest houses, restaurants and pubs in Fort William would beg to disagree.  Sure it's exploitation and if anyone else said it, more people might agree. If I recall correctly, during the awful Foot-and-Mouth epidemic, the Blair government was presenting a totally different picture of the UK countryside, in a desperate effort to draw overseas visitors (including those of us in the US) to the UK and thereby generate tourism related income. I couldn't believe the advertisements I saw over here, telling us that the countryside was open and ""come over"". Not according to my family, who still live throughout the UK. The hypocrisy takes your breath away.  I think that the pope should stop trying to give his opinion to everyone. I personally do not care what he thinks about anything! He maybe a nice old boy in person, but he is the figurehead of the most eco-unfriendly organisation on the planet. Call the kettle black is an understatement. How many people need tourism to survive? I am not saying that is right of course, but that is the way that it is for many. If ""God's man on Earth"" (as if that isn't cosmic stuff for a start), thinks that he can change things by talking about them he is wrong. He needs to get some of them gold crosses off the altars, sell them and then give them to people who rely on tourism to survive. If he is not prepared to do that then he should keep quiet. Man, the hypocrisy of it all.  If I had enough money, I would visit every country of the world. The fun of being in a different place is great fun. It is certainly more interesting then just visiting places in one's own country. It is not only getting drunk and eating one's own country's food, you enjoy colours, clothes, climate, atmosphere, sounds, faces, gestures, manners, art, women and men, and thousand other ways of doing things and having pleasure.  Is the Pope in real contact with ordinary people?  The Pope has a good point, and it has already been made by Tourism Concern. Obviously there will be complaints that he shouldn't dictate to people how to spend their leisure time, but it doesn't alter the fact that ill planned tourism does little for the native economy, and may put even more pressure on stretched resources - e.g. water supplies. Ethical tourism is an ideal, but in the meantime no new spots should be opened up until the full impact of the development is assessed, not just the balance sheet of the tour operator/developer!  The Vatican makes money by tourism. Does GOD get royalties from that. Without GOD you can't purchase a piece of heaven.  It is horrific exploitation of the travellers. People who leave their country to go ""somewhere hot and sunny"" and then spend two weeks getting drunk and eating their own national food. What is the point? When I travel I want to see the country I visit, I don't want to eat English food in an English pub and speak English. Even if my command of the local language is embryonic I still like to see what the country is really like.  There's another loser: ourselves. Many people are ignorant of the beauty of the UK whilst holidaying frequently in foreign resorts. This corrodes our national identity and turns the UK into the place where you ""have to be"" and the rest of the world into the place you 'want to be'.  I feel that the Pope is using his position, to speak out on many issues which are irrelevant to Catholicism at the moment. Take his recent visit to Syria, far too political for a Pontiff. I always respected him before that, although I am not Catholic, but my feelings are changing.   And of course, the Pope and the Catholic Church have NEVER been guilty of exploiting ANYTHING have they, oh no, who would think such a thing.  Does that mean that he will staying in the Vatican from now on ? That can only be good news.  Tourism is ingrained in our culture and as such is unstoppable. All we can do is learn to be ""good tourists"".  Who ever listens to this guy? A country can develop tourism for its own good in whatever way it chooses. The clever countries will see that preserving its own identity and beauty will win in the long run, rather than becoming a ""Majorca"".  Surely as the head of the Catholic Church the Pope cannot comment on tourism. How many millions of Lira does the Vatican City make from tourism. Also Lourdes and the various cathedrals around the world. I think he should speak to his accountants before making such a sweeping statement.  Do I smell creeping hypocrisy here? The Pope complaining about mass tourism, and he the head of the richest organisation on the planet? Where millions of lira are raked in down at St Peter's square daily on all manner of religious schlock. Have mercy!  The tourists pay too much for everything they do, simply through ignorance as to the correct prices in the country they are in. This causes a huge imbalance in wealth in the local population. So the tourists are certainly exploited. The locals not involved in tourism lose out but aren't exploited (check the meaning of exploited in the dictionary!). The only winners are the locals involved with tourism and the real loser is the environment - that really is exploited by all. Besides, when has the church cared about anything that doesn't involve profit?  What does the Pope know about business? There again, aren't pilgrimages, and Catholic things like Lourdes the most exploitative form of tourism?  Tourism, as opposed to travel, is nothing more than a scavenging of beauty. A man or woman who brings nothing to a foreign land - save money and garbage - has effectively negated whatever benefits might have been reaped from leaving home in the first place.  Catering to tourism is a natural economic activity - even during the Middle Ages the principal pilgrimage spots of the Church presented economic opportunities for local people. Taste, of course, is a matter of opinion, and people will tend to disagree on whether selling souvenirs in holy or historic places is appropriate.  And what is wrong with people desiring consumer goods? Our cars, our TVs, our computers, our cereals, even the beds we sleep on all add quality to our lives and so does taking a holiday we enjoy. Are we now to be told that it is a sin to enjoy a vacation that gives us the rest, relaxation and recovery so many of us need from the stress of our daily working lives?  A significant part of the price paid by the tourist from the affluent West goes to those organising the tours - located in and working from the wealthy West. What little of the tour price that finds its way to the developing world gets gobbled up by the local contacts of the tour companies. Precious little of the tour price ever benefits those whose land, resources are exploited to provide the tourist attractions to those from abroad. The local economy and society gets swamped by the cocooned tourist invasion.  The Pope may speak about things celestial but ought to leave pedestrian tourism to travellers and tourists. In many countries tourism is the major export for individual elements of society in need of money. Dollar for dollar, tourism is the most earth friendly industry. Also, the vast majority of tourist dollars go directly to individuals rather than to a cabal of a few. When tourists view the wonders of Bukhara, Samarkand, Khiva, Merv, Ashgabat, Ephesus, Mycenae, etc, ordinary individuals - potters, artists, weavers, wood carvers, tour guides, musicians, translators, taxi and bus drivers, camel drivers, folk dancers, food caterers - all benefit directly instead of some government bureau. On top of the money, people get to evaluate each other in various intimate ways in a manner whereby everyone benefits and no one loses. How then can tourism, by anybody's definition be something that is not good?  The Pope is right, and in fact TV is very largely to blame, for showing us such interesting holiday and natural history programmes about places which hordes of us then want to go and see. I don't think we can stop it happening, but we can probably at least ensure that the money we spend is fairly distributed in the host country. In too many third world countries the benefits merely go to a few individuals.  Is the Pope forgetting that it was pilgrimages to holy sites that started the package tour? See Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.  One could certainly argue that both the tourists and the local population are, to a certain extent, exploited by the tourism process, but since the tourist goes in full-well knowing what will happen to him I doubt that he has cause to complain. The local people may have a stronger case, but it is unlikely that the trade could exist without at least a certain level of complicity both ways.  If it wasn't for tourism, places like Thailand and Bali would suffer more due to the lack of added income. If you choose to label tourism as exploitation, then you can also refer to international trade and cultural festivals as the same. All promote and encourage globalisation. It has gone too far if tourism falls under negative criticism.  Tourism brings people into contact with other cultures, however superficially, and in so doing broadens people's experience and understanding. That, surely, is a good thing: for example, I am convinced that German mass tourism in the Netherlands has helped to reduce tensions between those two countries. Sexual exploitation and environmental impact are problems that need to be addressed separately. It may well be that in certain tourist spots the choices made have to be reconsidered. Incidentally, I will be visiting Rome this summer -- where the Pope lives -- for deliberate exposure to the local culture there.  The Pope is correct in speaking out against tourism that exploits and subverts local culture and heritage. I live on a small Island called Prince Edward Island, which depends heavily on summer tourism to fuel its economy. Mass tourism can reduce a culture, turn its heritage and traditions into commodities, and alter the personality and social character of a place. Unfortunately, that is the price which Prince Edward Island has paid, in return for the low-paying summer employment and revenues that have come from tourism. We are in grave danger of killing the goose that laid the golden egg!  I was shocked by Pope John Paul II labelling mass tourism a form of exploitation. He does not exhibit sound judgement about an industry fulfilling groundwork for people's aspiration for a higher quality of life and he renounces the irrefutable impact of this industry in fostering and nurturing peace and maintaining global understanding.  The Pope is living in the past. The fact is, Tourism is essential for most countries as a source of income. I do agree that tourism should not spoil the natural beauty existing there before. But if tourism was abolished, the poorer countries would be ""exploited"" by the forces of starvation and poverty instead.  I fully agree that many countries depend mostly upon tourism for their livelihood. In fact, many countries in Asia are channelling much of their funds into developing tourist facilities. That is an industry, not a form of exploitation. However, we have to face the fact that all industries exploit people as well as the environment to a certain extent and it is up to us to keep the exploitation to the minimum.  Speaking from personal experience in both Zimbabwe and South Africa, I have to agree with the Pope. As a member of the local 'middle class' I found it more and more difficult to go on holiday in my own country. Camp sites and hotels were priced for US dollar and Pound-toting tourists not for us citizens.  Ask a South African how difficult it is to get into the Kruger National Park. Ask a Zimbabwean (not a commercial farmer) if he can afford to go on a safari (at US$450/day I doubt it). Africa is being turned into a playground for the Western elite. While a small number of locals are filling their foreign accounts with the proceeds, the majority of the population of these destinations receive no benefit at all.   I think he's hit the nail on the head with these statements; I'm not so certain that there's any alternative for some poorer countries but I'm glad that someone has said this. The idea of rich people's tourist resorts in places like Mexico, Sri Lanka etc is gross.  The Pope is foolish to suggest that tourism is exploitation. Tourists bring much needed money into many poor areas around the world.  The Pope is a spiritual leader - not an economic one. Try to understand what he is saying from a spiritual perspective. If we were more focused on the spiritual well-being of others, rather than on our own self-gratification, then maybe the Pope wouldn't be so worried about how we spend our leisure time. I'm sure he is well aware of the enormous problem of poverty throughout the world. He probably thinks that there are more positive ways of dealing with it than through mass tourism in its current form.  He may have a valid point, but fact is that most countries thrive on that so called exploitation, some even don't have a economy without tourism. . I don't think its his place to tell us where to holiday either.  Pope John Paul II branding tourism as the new form of exploitation, seems to a great extent correct. Tourism, on many occasions have been found creating exploitation . However, the eco-tourism may continue be bringing prosperity to much needed areas as well as a source of entertainment as and when the respective governments would take extra care to ensure that mass tourism does not create exploitation in that specific area .  The Catholic Church has been practicing exploitation of poor people and countries for centuries. Is tourism encroaching on that turf?  I agree with the Pope in one sense. However I feel the head of the catholic church should be the last person to speak about the threat of changing cultures  Tourism certainly can be a form of exploitation, when it leads to exploitation of women and children for sex tourists, increase in STD's and AIDS, the proliferation of drugs in local communities, smuggling abroad of local treasures and antiques, and the debasement of local cultures and ceremonies when used out of context and packaged for tourists. It is ironic though, that the Pope should be concerned about tourism transforming ""culture, religious ceremonies and ethnic festivities"" since ""tourists"" of a different variety, namely Christian missionaries can be accused of the same.  Look who's talking. I remember when this pope visited the Netherlands, he did everything to avoid immersion in the Dutch culture of liberal criticism and only agreed to meet his lap dogs. The pope's view on tourism is true, but it is an elitist truth, and the so-called eco-tourism is an elitist form of tourism. The sun-seeking mass tourists are not going to develop a genuine interest in different cultures overnight, so if they are satisfied with the charades performed for their entertainment, let them. If all of them suddenly would become eco-tourists, who could tell whether the eco-nomical benefits would be worth the eco-logical destruction that would be the result of mass eco-tourism. "
HOC HOC-CS -0.1 " Flying is not 'statistically' a safe way to travel. It depends on how you interpret the statistics. If there were the same number of take-offs as car journeys, there would be thousands of deaths each day from plane crashes. Therefore each take-off is very 'risky'. The rate at which crashes occur has remained fairly steady for many years but the volume of traffic has increased many times over. So what does this mean? It means that as a person (unit) you are very unlikely to die in a plane crash indeed. Flying is still the safest way to travel by far!      I'm getting on a American Airlines flight in a few days, and yes I'm nervous about it. Whether this latest crash was terrorist or accident, the result is the same. I'm concerned about the job layoffs in the airlines business. Based on most union work labour rules, the ones laid off are the newest workers. Just because someone's been at a job the longest, does not by any means make them the best worker.      Flying is so very very safe, even these days. When boarding a plane, try to limit yourself to being as nervous as you would be when crossing the road - you'll feel better, although you'll still be worrying more than you should be!      It's the press that are making people more nervous by asking the question ""Are you more nervous to fly now than before Sept 11"" - it doesn't bother me.      Yes, I am now nervous of flying. Because my family are in another country I fly on a regular basis, but what is worse my daughter of ten is now frightened and has to hold my hand when we fly. It is sad to see the terror instead of happiness that used to be there before all this happened. Now, with America's new plane crash, it makes things worse.      Based on the evidence available, Monday's incident sounds tragic, but not intentional. It doesn't make me afraid to fly, because airplane crashes are astonishingly rare. My odds are excellent - far better than during my daily commute to work. I will continue to fly without trepidation, and I will continue to fly American Airlines.      Yes, I am even more scared of flying now than I used to be.. I think it will be a long time before I board a plane again and when I do I will have to be inebriated by alcohol but I would rather go by train, boat or car and take a lot longer to get there.      I think the situation has improved for flyers. Besides shorter check-in lines and possibilities of free upgrades, the dumb security questions have been revised for the better. At Heathrow recently, instead of being asked all the usual dull questions about whether someone had asked me to carry something, if the bag had been out of my sight etc etc, I was asked just one question instead: Have you got any sharp objects on you - blades, scissors etc? Naturally I replied no, and that evidently was sufficient. This means we don't all have to turn up so early for flights any more. What an improvement.      As for the old chestnut of flying being safe or not, the majority of your readers will not have had the enlightening experience of daily driving in Portugal, after which the worry of terrorists on airplanes becomes positively irrelevant.      I think that air transportation is safer now than it has been in the past, with the increased security measures both on the ground in airports and in terms of maintenance, as well as in the air. Airline travel will remain my first option for travelling, and American Airlines has now risen to the top of my list as my preferred airline. No one is going to take away my freedom to move around in this world. No one is going to get ""in my head"" and take away my freedom to feel comfortable with moving around in this world.      I fly at least 80 times a year on business and this issue is never far from my thoughts. It is often said, if not over quoted, that flying is the safest way to travel. This is a measure of people travelling against miles travelled and is a questionable statistic. A better way to look at it would be to examine survival rates in accidents and then you will get a truer, probably grimmer picture. I'm sure more people walk away from train or car wrecks than they do from airline disasters. There must be a way to increase survivability. Airliners themselves are testament to human ingenuity so why not invest in preserving lives? You don't need to be a genius to work that one out.      I'm flying from Bangkok to New Zealand today and have no qualms about it. We should realise that we are all suffering from a terminal illness called life and just accept that we're all gonna go sometime.      Will I ever fly again? Yes, I can't avoid it. But I will be wide awake, and will need a few more cups of coffee than usual. Hope the airlines don't cut back on that.      As I understand it, airlines in America successfully challenged tighter security measures suggested by the Clinton administration. The CEO of BA considers those who do not fly to be cowards and now I have just read that the plane that so tragically has just crashed in NY was unfit to fly - whether I am nervous about flying is irrelevant, I am beginning to form the impression that these companies do not deserve our money.      Flying will probably never be the same as it was prior to the attacks on the legendary Twin Towers and the Pentagon. As Phil, UK puts it best it ""is no more dangerous now than it was pre-11 September. Flying remains the safest way of travel; unfortunately, rare accidents do happen. Would I get on a plane tomorrow to go about my business? - Absolutely, and it would be on my favourite carrier, American Airlines.      Naturally it makes me a little nervy but just look at the statistics. How many more people are killed crossing a road in the UK than by an air accident? The reason these accidents are so well reported is because they are rare: unfortunately those who die in car piles ups do not make news. I'm travelling to Israel from the UK this Xmas. Wonder how good my chances are?!      Flying is no more dangerous now than it was pre-11 September. People are just more frightened.      If anything, things have changed slightly for the better! Prior to 11th September mechanical failures on aircraft were just as likely as they are now, and both government intelligence, and security at airports were, if anything, worse. Therefore, you have statistically a somewhat lower chance of being killed in an aircraft than you did before 11th September. Do you become progressively more frightened of driving every time there is a car accident reported?      This crash happened at a very bad time, when airlines are trying to recover from the 9/11 atrocity. Though tragic, this will not deter me from flying, either on business or for pleasure. But it reinforces my belief that airport authorities have to be more alert about who is employed and given access to aircraft.      What is wrong with our media - and why do we put up with it? Already it is being accepted that this was ""probably an accident, but tragic nonetheless"". An engine BLOWS OFF the wing of 767 out of NEW YORK two months after.. - you know the rest. The last thing American airlines, and the US want, is for people to think that people are scaling perimeter fences strapping explosives to engines - but does our free media have to tow their line? ""Sabotage until proven otherwise"" should be the attitude in the present circumstances.      Accidents do happen and can be very tragic at times. Let's not combine this with the problem of terrorism. All the same, a sense of fear and insecurity may have crept in the minds of the US citizens. But they have to rise to the occasion and put aside all the odds to get back to the normal lives as quick as possible.      I am not happy hearing news reports that security at most US airports is still conducted on either profiling or random searches. This makes me feel like they are taking chances with my life, as my safety will depend on the security personnel making the correct choices or worse yet, playing the odds game. I for one would not mind having to show up at the airport earlier if it meant that everyone going into that plane will be thoroughly searched, and that includes the maintenance crew, ground crew, plus anyone who may have access to any part of the planes. I am aware that this represents an inconvenience to the passengers and added cost to the airlines who will of course pass these on. However, I would rather pay more and be truly safe than save myself time or money and take higher odds with my life.      I would be more nervous about using JFK airport than flying as such. TWA crashed in 1997, Swissair crashed in 1998, EgyptAir in 1999 and American Airlines in 2001. All these major crashes departed from JFK which seems rather unlucky compared with other European and American airports.      There is no doubt that this will be devastating to airlines and will be another blow to passenger confidence. The critical thing is to determine whether initial reports that it was a genuine accident are correct. If so then, tragic as it is, it is a coincidence. For myself I have always hated flying but my holiday to the US is still going ahead. If fate calls my name at least it will catch me having fun rather than hiding from what might be.      I hope this is ""just"" another tragic, but rare, accident that afflicts the air travel industry from time to time - and not another terrorist outrage. Our sympathies go to all those who have lost family and friends. Even if it is an attack, I'm still going to fly. To quit is to give the terrorists what they want. The object of terror is to terrorise, to deter by any means, to stop your opponents from living a normal life - until they give you what you want. Don't let them win, America.      At Heathrow recently, instead of being asked all the usual dull questions about whether someone had asked me to carry something, if the bag had been out of my sight etc. (you know the drill), I was asked just one question instead; Have you got any sharp objects on you - blades, scissors etc. Naturally I replied no, and that evidently was sufficient. This means we don't all have to turn up so early for flights anymore. What an improvement. As for the old chestnut of flying being safe or not, I can only point out that the majority of your readers will not have had the enlightening experience of daily driving in Portugal, after which the worry of terrorists on airplanes becomes positively irrelevant.      Statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel. I am from London and am making a point of taking my next holiday in New York. I feel it is a good way to show support to the people there and defiance to the terrorists who are trying to ruin our way of life.      I am supposed to be going on holiday next summer but because of the recent air crashes I honestly don't think I'll be able to fly. I had a fear before - now it's worse.      I am flying to Israel tomorrow morning, and nothing is going to stop me. I mourn with the rest of the world for the airline tragedies - Sept. 11th, Queens this Monday, the Russian plane shot down by mistake - but, people, there have been awful accidents on boats (Titanic), rail (Hatfield) and every other means of transport. The only way forward is to continue as before, so as to prevent thousands from losing their jobs and adding to humanity's loss.      After the terrorist attacks in New York, I would say I am wary about using aeroplanes as a method of travelling. I never really was a regular user but it will make me consider using alternative methods of travel.       Not only will I continue to fly, I have specifically chosen to go to London for my vacation because of the support of the British people and government against the terrorists. One good turn deserves another. I REFUSE to give in to the terrorists and their tactics. See you in London! "
HOC HOC-DK -0.1 " The law is irrelevant in this case. Those who wish to smoke, smoke. When a law is irrelevant and only succeeds in making criminals of many educated people, the law needs to change not the people. Cannabis will eventually become legalised, just as abortion was in the 1960s. Policy makers are always 20 or 30 years behind the times. Legalisation does not mean everyone will be puffing on the streets, simply that people will continue to do what they have always done in their homes but without the possibility of the taxpayer facing a huge bill for their incarceration.  If the infrastructure of supply is removed from organised crime, who is going to effectively maintain supply at the current levels of demand?   Will there be amnesty for people imprisoned or previously convicted on cannabis charges?  Will cannabis be taxed?   Who will make most profit - the growers, wholesalers or the government?      Bad move. There is a reason why it is called dope !!      Neal's comment that decriminalisation will lead to more power for terrorists is completely bogus. Many problems in drug producing nations are directly related to criminal policies. If I can buy a kilo of coke for $1000 dollars here and sell it for 150 times the price in Europe; it goes some way to explaining the corrupting influence of drug production in the developing world. This progressive move can only be positive for developing countries as well as Britain. As one Jamaican put it: ""If they legalised tomorrow, one good shipment of herb would write off our island's debts!""      The proposed 'down grade' of Cannabis is madness. This proposal will increase trade with dealers who also promote the sale of Class A drugs.      No-one has yet mentioned the danger of progressing to harder drugs to get more of a 'high', or some of the medical dangers of using even soft drugs. And are we only going to enforce laws by consensus, and disobey laws we do not agree with? If we delve a bit deeper, why do people want to take these drugs anyway? What is the problem that makes us want to 'blow our minds'? There has been a flight from reason and thinking in the West for many years now, and weird spiritualities and altered states of consciousness induced by hallucinogenic drugs are a part of this. Legalisation of cannabis is one more example of dumbing-down the population into a stupor!      If cannabis is legalised surely it will put more peer pressure on us kids to try it. I will be 12 in December, so there are more things that worry us, but being 'cool' is very important among young people. They will do anything to be cool, so it must not be legalised      I just wish other governments would have the same approach.      There are two reasons why cannabis use can lead on to other, more harmful substances. First, cannabis users are forced to buy their supplies from drug dealers, the same people who sell crack and smack. Second, society keeps telling cannabis users that their drug of choice is hardly different from crack and smack. They know that cannabis is OK, so they assume the government is lying about the other drugs. Neither of these reasons would apply if cannabis were legally available.      Holland happens to have an average heroin user age of 40+, whereas in this country the age is falling annually - below 20. Amongst cannabis smokers heroin is considered as taboo. I smoked cannabis and still graduated with a first in Pure Maths and went on to Oxbridge - so much for the damaged brain cells. I have never witnessed violence amongst cannabis users. Clearly, if cannabis is criminalized then it becomes a black market commodity like heroin. Youngsters looking for it will invariably come into contact with heroin and other hard drugs. Am I deluded or is the above simply common sense.      The main so-called ""gateway drug"" is actually nicotine. Research shows that over 90 percent of all drug users are actually smokers. As cannabis is usually smoked, it might seem that cannabis itself is the gateway, but research is beginning to show that this is not the case!      Thus far it seems that even when people actually stop bleating about drugs being bad and analyse the effects, they still can't put things into perspective. The comparison between alcohol and marijuana may be valid in that they both have few side effects if taken in small doses, but how many injuries at the weekends are attributed to angry weed smokers with a broken bottle?      I feel really sorry for MS sufferers, and others who could benefit from prescribed cannabis. It is extremely hypocritical of any government to prevent a doctor from prescribing such a comparatively harmless drug when the same doctor can lawfully prescribe the use of morphine, a derivative of opium and a highly addictive substance. I hope that the relaxation of the law will allow these unfortunate people to now benefit from the medicinal effects of cannabis.      I want cannabis completely decriminalised as soon as possible. I have been severely disabled and chronically ill with ME for four years now, and my consultant has confessed that it is unlikely my fibromyalgic pain will ever be a thing of the past. Whilst there is no cure for ME as yet, cannabis is the only drug or treatment I have found effective to help me feel a bit better physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally and intellectually. Yes, I am still disabled, but I am much more able to enjoy a greatly restricted life with the use of cannabis, as are many chronically or terminally ill people with a wide range of illnesses. It must be decriminalised as soon as possible. It is a cheap and effective medicine.      If one is dealt more responsibility one is more likely to behave more responsibly. I am happy for those who have been suffering and can at last enjoy a few pain-free moments. I know what severe pain is like. For example, I had to vomit from pains but couldn't bend down to do so, leaving no dignity at all. I was told to drink whisky, which I also herald as a great analgesic, but more damaging than a couple of puffs on a joint. In future I will try both and see.      Some people who use alcohol are liable to use violence, abuse and other anti social behaviour. I have never seen this with cannabis use. You get the occasional attack of the chocolate craving variety and that's about it really. The sooner the politicians are brave enough to realise that a very large number of voters are in favour of legalisation, the Better.      It is simply unbelievable that cannabis is still illegal in this country. There just isn't any excuse for keeping such a useful resource from the general public. The government is keen to tell us that cannabis is harmful to our health, but what about the positive effects? Cannabis is a brilliant and particularly beautiful plant and should be legalised immediately. The current state of affairs simply undermines police as having any credibility at all with young people when it comes to drugs. Legalisation is the only rational step now.      I agree with Paul Haydin. The worst effect of making cannabis possession illegal is that it criminalizes young people that will try it anyway. If you want people to respect the law, then the law should be kept respectable.      Responsibility is the name of the game here and I am so pleased that we all are allowed to have some responsibility. We all know the arguments about tobacco and really there are no particular benefits in a cigarette, although there may well be in a hookah-pipe enriched with orange-blossoms. Perhaps, finally we are less afraid of what grows naturally. Like cloves and mushrooms for example. They have medicinal and therapeutic benefits, as in fact do poppy seeds and inhaled opium into a chest infection, with far less than antibiotics. Please, let's take this debate further, or is this what everyone was afraid of?      Cannabis can cause cancer. Do we really want to licence something that is likely to add to NHS problems? If you want to get high, take a walk in the hills.      As a member of that minority of Americans that have never used any illegal drug, I believe that to criminalize drugs is insane. I base this in large part on the history of my nation's war on drugs crusade past and present. Despite the expenditure of billions of dollars in the present conflict, no scientific survey shows any success whatever. The war is lost and has been for a decade, yet, unlike prohibition it goes on. The only results are marked increases in criminal activity, organized crime, property crime and bullets flying about our streets. Drugs should be decriminalised and regulated. That would put the criminals out of business, protect our children and our property as our police agencies cannot.      Before we all start shouting for legalisation again, bear in mind that many of the world's drug producing nations are havens for terrorist groups, and they are funded by the proceeds. Legalisation will not remove the criminal element from the equation. Maybe it will on the local street dealer level, but not where it counts. Legalisation will certainly cause an increase in use and therefore more power to the terrorists in Colombia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Iran, and Lebanon, to name but a few.      Neal USA/UK: you say that by legalising cannabis we will still be funding terrorists. Have you not thought as I would say most people have that if it were to become legal or as near to it as possible that we dope smokers would most likely grow our own and even the government regulate its sale, thus ending the sponsorship of terrorists.      To Neal USA/UK: If cannabis were legalized then why couldn't the government allow farmers to grow the stuff and then tax it just like we do with cigarettes? We wouldn't need to get it from another country. I don't see where it would profit the terrorist groups if our countries grow and supply our own. It would only be beneficial to the farmers and the economy.      While I think this is the back door to legalising cannabis, it sends the wrong message to young people. But then it will keep some people sweet. That's what the Labour Party does, after all.      Maybe at last our politicians will have the bottle to support Paul Flynn MP who has consistently failed in his many attempts to legalise cannabis. All Mr Blunkett has done is to make it politically acceptable for all to now support calls to end an unjust and extreme draconian law.      I have never smoked cannabis, and legal or illegal, never would. It simply doesn't appeal to me. That's my choice. But from what I've seen, people under the influence of cannabis are no worse behaved than those under the influence of alcohol and it's legal to sell that. Legalise it, stick a huge tax on it, like we do cigarettes and alcohol, and then leave it up to the individual whether they use it or not.      That cannabis was ever lumped in with other drugs and made illegal was a travesty. The tax money we've wasted on arresting, putting on trial and even imprisoning users of this drug beggars belief. I have been an occasional cannabis smoker for the last 10 years and I can say the only crimes I've known it to ever be responsible for were to promote bad tastes in music, clothes and food.      Hopefully now cannabis will be legalised, and the majority of hard working people who smoke will not be classed as lawbreakers.      About time too. Now maybe the Police will have time to arrest the real criminals and vandals on our streets and concentrate on the Hard drug users.      By all means legalise cannabis for private use - this is long overdue. At the same time, a law and guidelines should be introduced, on par with the current intoxication laws. Anyone incapable of standing, being unruly or not being able to carry out required duties due to imbibing cannabis should be punished, as they are for drunken and disorderly behaviour. Also, employers should retain the right to insist on having cannabis-free staff, and the staff themselves the right to work in a cannabis-free environment.      It's about time the government stopped misrepresenting the ""threat"" cannabis causes. Hopefully, this is the first step towards legalisation for recreational and medicinal use. For the moment however, the hypocrisy stands, and the change in the law just means that vastly varying punishments, from a telling off to 2 years in jail, can be dealt out for this victimless crime.      Virtually every society in the world has developed some means of intoxicating itself, be it through drink or drugs. I've no problem with anybody taking cannabis as long as measures are put in place to stop people driving while under the influence. The only reason that no government takes a realistic stance on this issue is that they care too much about being seen to do the right thing than actually doing the right thing. Cannabis isn't the thin edge of the wedge. The people I know who take cannabis aren't inclined to take anything harder. Nicotine is more of a gateway drug than cannabis will ever be.      Absolutely legalise it. It has had a long history as a remedy of many ailments, including the terrible affliction MS, for thousands of years. It is stupid bureaucracy that has made a wonderful thing illegal. I think because it is also an excellent anti-depressant and probably a competitor to the big drug companies producing stuff like Prozac.      If a person is found to be a regular cannabis user, what should be done regarding their driver's licence, or their eligibility for dangerous work such as fighting fires, fighting crime, operating machinery or cranes and working on building sites ? All these activities require unimpaired reaction times, co-ordination and agility. What will be the sentence for a person found guilty of causing an accident while under the influence of cannabis? I do not want to be subjected to the risk posed by a stoner behind a steering wheel.      Go into a supermarket or into your local liquor store, and with little money you will be able to buy a lethal dose of alcohol - completely legally. Think about it - and about how many people have died of cannabis overdose (0) - next time you vote for some hypocrite who wants to ""keep your kids off drugs"".       The current level of cannabis users between 900,000 and 5 million people represents a considerable minority of otherwise law-abiding people (quite a similar figure to the number of regular church-goers). Concerns of the informed and intelligent cannabis users regarding decriminalisation are:"
HOC HOC-FW -0.08 " Russia used to be a feared and respected superpower, whatever her internal problems (and they were many). I feel it is highly unlikely that she will regain that former status and ""compete"" with the US. So why bother trying? The world is facing an energy crisis and the Kyoto protocol has been reduced in effectiveness. Russia has vast unpopulated wildernesses on which she could build windfarms. Imagine the new power to be gained by being the supplier of environmentally friendly electricity to the whole of Europe!      Yeltsin shares as much, if not more, of the responsibility for the destruction of the USSR as Gorbachev. As his influence in the Russian Federation grew (up to his election as President in June 1991), he rocked the Soviet boat. He couldn't forgive his expulsion from the Politburo and wanted to bring Gorbachev down almost at any cost. His moves to make the hitherto right-less Russian republic more independent resulted in less contribution to the USSR budget (which meant its inability to hold together, with much of Central Asia and the Baltics depending on subsidies - the only way to maintain them in a closed economy).      This culminated in the proclamation of the supremacy of Russian law over Soviet law in the 1991 Declaration of Independence. Given this blueprint for a new Union Treaty, the conservatives' reaction (the putsch) is not surprising.      I have travelled in Russia and find that its people are some of the most noble and dignified people I have ever met, whether under the rule of the USSR or the current government they have an incredible spiritual nationalism which in my opinion is unrivalled in the modern world. While times were uneasy to say the least during the USSR's time, we must also realise what the USSR gave us.      Competition with the United States led to Sputnik, Apollo 11, satellites upon satellites, unheard of technological advances and the most rapid evolution of human technological and industrial achievement ever assembled. Without the challenges the USSR presented, we would not have half the technology we have today. A recent article in Time magazine referred to the USSR as ""the only nation the United States was ever afraid of, and its not often lamented competitor."" The development of atomic weapons aside, look at how far we have developed since the end of World War II. Most of it would not exist if it were not for Russia.      In the USSR, every language was official in its respective territorial unit alongside Russian, the nationwide language. In many ""republics"" there were three-four languages, and in Daghestan a whole thirty. Ukraine even witnessed a fierce Ukrainisation in the 1920s--Ukrainian was imposed even on all areas that just happened to be under the jurisdiction of the UkrSSR (such as Odessa), often with comical consequences.      It is also hard to agree that the USSR served the ethnic Russians - most RSFSR territories had the lowest living standards and the least consumer goods. Trips to Moscow, Leningrad and the other 14 republics were used by ordinary Russians for shopping. Meanwhile, the Soviet government gave aid to any third-world country that applied. Russians felt they were being milked by the rest of the eastern Bloc (which I think is true), and this discontent resulted in the June 12, 1991 Declaration of Sovereignty (which made Russia financially independent), which in turn fuelled the August coup and the Soviet collapse altogether.      Why do people need so-called freedom if their stomachs are empty and their children are sick because they can't buy them cheapest antibiotic? For those who live in the land of freedom here is a little food for thought. Do you know that US jail over two million people every year? That is more people than were jailed in ""bad"", nasty, ugly USSR in Stalin's time.      Those who say that people of Ukraine are happy because they can speak Ukrainian again. You probably don't know that about 60% of the people in Ukraine speak Russian as their first language. That all Eastern, Southern majority of Northern and Central Ukraine speak Russian. You don't know that a lot of people at the EAST would gladly be under Russian ""yoke"" then be ""free"" of it. And if you think that I am 60 years old and have psychiatric disorder please note that I am just 25 and I am really sorry that USSR broke up.      Without there having been the ""Soviet"" times, I think the people of the world both in the East and the West would have been much worse off. All the social security, benefits and decent salaries enjoyed by general public in the rich capitalist countries were created to compete with the socialist model and indeed to prevent a popular uprising. However terrible the regime was, the human cost of communist rule (which I personally benefited from) is incomparable to the cost of capitalism: slavery of Africans, commerce driven imperialism, both world wars - I'm sure you get the idea. I think it is shallow to debate whether life was ""better"" during the communist era or not. It was better for some and terrible for others, just like it always will be everywhere in the world. What particular con the people in power are justifying themselves with is quite irrelevant. At the end of the day, it's about what are you willing to make of your situation.      The Gross Domestic Product of Ukraine has declined to approximately 20 percent of its value ten years ago. On top of that, the economic structure is in ruins and today the country is very largely operating on a black market economy. If you don't believe this, you only have to think about the average monthly income for professionals. School teachers and university lecturers, for example, have an official monthly income of around $30 US, and even that often fails to appear for several months at a time. They need at least $100 per month to live even decently. The people in these jobs somehow survive too. How is that achieved? The black market. The country runs on a black market economy.      Chicago is one of the places where every ethnic group looking for opportunity ends up. I can only relate the Eastern European experience to the migration from the farms all over this country and other struggling ethnic groups who have come here. For most it takes two to three generations to become fully part of the new society and to build a support network. You are looking at 50 to 100 years of change if they ""keep their eye on the ball"".      Those of you who write in to say how wonderful it is to have the freedom to travel abroad, enjoy your untethered business enterprises, etc., should be glad indeed. You are in the extreme minority. For the rest of the people life is hard - harder than it ever was under the Soviet Union, but the trouble is that most people do not have the resources to publicise this fact.      I had lived under USSR boot for 16 years in Poland. Was it a good life? Absolutely not! However, I believe in a Russian nation. One can say that this is a first shot at their real freedom. Since its inception Russian folk has been under Tartars, Mongols, Tzars and the Communist boot. A regular Russian does not understand word ""freedom"", but he will. I used to hate Russians for what they did to my country, Poland. However, now I see them as me, good people who want to enjoy life and freedom as I want. A country of Rachmaninov, Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy. How can you not love them? Too much beauty to just spit and discard Russia as nothing because it is poor.      My wife is from Ukraine and I have visited this country recently. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union things have changed, but not necessarily for the better. There was corruption in the USSR and there is still corruption, in fact corruption pervades everyday life from trying to buy a phone, to having to pay for train timetable information. There are more products in the shops, but people have less money to pay for them. In fact most honest people are living day to day on subsistence levels. There are frequent power, gas and water cuts and people live behind steel bolted doors in their old concrete Soviet apartments. The government raise the apartment costs every month - although many people cannot afford to pay anything for their accommodation.      For the people lucky to have a job, incomes are very low and employees often go for months without pay. When they are paid, it may be only a small proportion of what they have earned. Families are split by poverty and alcoholism. The wife often has to find 2 or 3 jobs to support a child, drunken husband and her parents all living in perhaps a two-room apartment. Go to visit a Russian or Ukrainian family and despite their poverty and hunger, they will feed you their last loaf of bread. Their kindness is the one ray of light in a destroyed, corrupt country.      The only way for the Soviet system to have survived and provided its citizens with anything near the living standards that Westeners rely on to sustain democratic institutions would have been to emulate China. Doing so may have maintained and built upon the existing structures, which as anyone who has been to the Third World will tell you could have been a lot worse.      Change to a Western style economy means worship of profit. The haves get more and the have nots get less.      It was very interesting to read messages on a board. First thing I thought about was how these people can have any judgement without having their own experience? Russia is a very interesting and I would say very special country with a great history. Someone said - ""not everything is black and white.."" after living in the States for almost 4 years I can argue with locals about their belief of American freedom.      Freedom here is total illusion. More and more Americans are coming to this understanding. I had been living in Russia for 28 years. It was different, difficult sometime. I did like Gorbachov's point of view - there was no need to change everything so dramatically and so fast, especially after one revolution, two wars, and Stalin's genocide. This great country and these great people will recover. They just need some time, they had been through a lot of difficulties in their history.      I liked the comment about the Russian soul, it is true, anyone that has dealt with Russians would know about the Russian soul, I only hope that the western market free policies do not destroy it. The change was too sudden, no preparation, nothing, Gorbachev, has a lot to answer for, he was hypnotised by Margaret Thatcher who changed the UK, but it took many years to get the UK to a point that resembles little America, with many people like in America right on the poverty line. I am not socialist, I just travel and see.      But for as long as there are people like the Russians I met, that give money to people (even few roubles) just because they say they need them more than themselves, there is still hope that the Russian soul will survive against the free market onslaught. Russians will climb back, Russians are good survivors like cats, and you can see how many there are in Moscow.      While it is certainly true that Russia (and other former Soviet republics) is struggling with economic problems most countries have never even contemplated it should be noted that as others have said the Russian people are perhaps the most resilient in the world and recovery will eventually come and we will all be better off for it, and while life may have been better for the ordinary Soviet citizen under Communism it should be noted that the Russian people are entitled to better than a choice of the current economic disaster and life under a Soviet regime.      The USSR served only Russia. The communists imposed the Russian language to Belarusians, Ukrainians and all others while the local languages were outlawed. Plus the Russians spread themselves to all countries in order to turn all the USSR into a bigger Russia. All non-Russians should be glad the USSR is no more.      Let's not put the Soviet Union and the Third Reich out of historical context. Authoritarian regimes have always existed, though these two were the last in the Western world (forgive me for classifying my savage country as Western). These regimes are rarely established without blood (later on it's more relaxed - we Soviets remember wearing wide jeans and long hair after the 50s: we faced some trouble, but not jail!), but that doesn't mean that everyone suffered and every law-abiding citizen of that regime was responsible for the atrocities. Hence (this may sound wild, but I believe I'm being objective), I don't see the need for Germans or the Soviets to denounce their respective ex-regimes altogether - it's not their fault they were born and lived there. For example, the Americans aren't renouncing the United States altogether with slavery and segregation in the past!      I am amazed at the patronising remarks of you Americans saying the Russians are in transition to democracy. You live in a country where the president got into power because the election was fiddled in the state where his brother was governor. What do you know about democracy? Wake up and smell the coffee. If you're lucky it'll be Cuban!      Democracy, ""Open or Market Economy"" and ""Freedom"" are sugar-coated pills of poison which only make the ""Doctors"" rich and cause the ""Patients"" to perish. Soviet people were poor but they lived with dignity with basic needs met. Their quality of life was much higher and the people were happy. The strong deep-rooted culture and the technological advances even over the US were the evidence of the healthy atmosphere that prevailed. Today, the majority become beggars while a handful of rich enjoy the wealth and praise the newly achieved ""freedom"". From a crime free society during the Socialist time, it rose to a mafia era where lives are so cheap and the law of the jungle has replaced the rule of law. It was the West (US) who won but not the Soviet people.      Was life better in the Soviet days? Emphatically NO. There are some who pine for the continuity of those times, but these tend to be the least able parts of society to adapt to changes. And the Soviet system was only occasionally able to provide for its citizens (actually, subjects). When I worked for PAP in Poland in 1990, we (as government workers) were issued tea, soap and toilet paper along with our salaries - so we wouldn't have to stand in line for these scarce items. Ironically these ""benefits"" were obsolete by 1990 because the collapse of the Soviet-supported system the year before had flooded Polish supermarkets with all the items that had been unavailable for the previous two decades. Remember, the Soviet system was not defeated by the West, it imploded of its own dead weight. That continuity was an illusion.      The majority of the societies liberated from the Soviet yolk are far better places to live now - not perfect, but they offer freedom and the ability to make a decent living. Only in places like Russia and Romania where gangster-style capitalism (replacing gangster-style communism) has taken root have the living standards declined over the past decade. The Soviet empire was one of the most barbaric and unjust creations of humanity, so its passing is not to be missed!      The price of freedom is responsibility. And that means responsibility for yourself, rather than expecting the State to look after you. At least in the Ukraine now, you can get a phone installed in a couple of weeks rather than having to bribe a Party official and ""still"" have to wait several years. The Ex-soviet countries have been starved of investment for the last 70 years. There's a lot of catching up to be done - this just can't happen overnight.      I can't wait until Russia joins the European Union. That is the only way that they will get back on their feet.      I doubt those who populated the Gulags and now rest in their cemeteries would understand the nostalgia for the Soviet system. It is a fact that no communist country has ever resisted the urge to lapse into authoritarianism so it's apparent that it is an inherently-flawed system. A little tweak here and there would not have made the Soviet Union more cuddly. It will take time and home-grown leadership for the trust in capitalism, democracy, and the rule of law to develop. If the leadership is lacking then we may be having the same debate 50 years from now.      I have just got back from Siberia where I asked whether life had improved since Soviet times. My hosts simply pointed to the abundance of food on the table - not to mention the freedom to express their opinions without fear. Westerners are fed a constant media diet of gloom about Russia, so they are far too ready to swallow the old myths about the absence of poverty in Soviet times etc. In contrast, most intelligent Russians recognise that any economic system is better than the blinkard stupidity of Soviet central planning. Few people realise that today Russia and the Ukraine are now the fastest-growing economies in Europe.      We in the West have to take a lot of the blame for what has happened. We insisted that Russia convert overnight to a market economy with ""shock"" economic plans which left ordinary people destitute and created a handful of overnight billionaires when surely the correct path was a gradual pace of change. It should however be remembered with concern that the President Putin is exercising increasingly centralised control over government with press freedoms being limited (there is now no independent TV network) and has shown little interest in tackling the Robber Barons who benefited from privatisation!      Things are considerably worse than what they should have been. Every prescription the poor Russians have gotten from the ""experts"" the West has been poison. None of the snake oil has ever been tried on Western countries - devaluations, inflation, privatising state industries into backroom sweetheart deals. The things that make the US, UK or even France or Germany prosper - an open, transparent market, rule of law and a stable currency - were never even tried by the ""experts"". I would not blame the Russians for thinking we are still trying to beat them into the dirt, only now we are using the IMF, instead of the ICBM's.      People say Russia is now run by the Mafia. Well, when WASN'T it run by a mafia of some sort? First it was the tsars, then the Communist Party and now the current ruling elite. Feudalism, then communism, then capitalism were all imposed from above and the Russians accepted them - or else! Perhaps it's not communism that people are nostalgic for, but tsarism. They're alike in many ways.      Sandman. You said that you feel it is better for the 'people to decide.' This is a good point. However, it disregards the fact that there is a force in society today that is capable of strongly influencing the general population. I am, of course, talking about the media. The growth of the media machine is exemplified by the Murdoch take-over of the UK airwaves, and to suggest that people's opinions are formed rationally and outside the pervasive influence of the media seems to me to be a bit naive. Democracy? Where?      The Soviet Union may not have been ""free"" but it tried to promote some very credible ideals. It has been vilified because they did not match our own. Surely the quality of life in the Soviet Union started to decrease when it was obvious it could not compete with the western economies. Both freedom and equality can be practised only when there is enough money to support them. The sad fact is that state planning was financially unworkable. Are we going to be having this discussion in forty years time? If capitalism's faults cannot be solved, probably not. Whatever replaces it will almost certainly not be free from dictatorship or poverty.      'The Russian people have a long and difficult path to thread before they reach their goal: there will be much more agony and bloody sweat but I am confident that from this young, mighty people new life will come'. This quote is from a book written in 1920 by a visitor to the new Soviet Union. Little did he realise that the process of change would take 100 years! A 'right way' for Russia (or any other country we care to mention) doesn't exist at the moment because we are living through a period of 'interesting times'. We'll all have to see what the next few decades bring...      For my folks it was better during the 'good' old days of the ex-USSR even though financially they are considerably better off now. They miss the certainty and feeling of security, and who can blame them? I personally do not miss the communist system even a bit, but I think the whole transition thing could have been handled in a much better manner.      The majority of Russians are nostalgic for the communist system because, all things considered, they were better off. Just as Cubans are now far better off than Haitians or Guatemalans. That's a fact and I don't see how any degree of ""freedom"" can compensate for not being able to get a decent meal.      Ten years after the collapse of communism, the Russians seem to have more freedom from both the state and party-politics. However, this new found 'economic liberalism' needs to be used wisely. Personal freedom without due consideration for fellow human beings and the environment is chaos. In the long run, chaos only leads to tyranny.      I went to the Former Soviet Union in August 1991, barely after the Coup and lived there for a good part of the 90s witnessing most of the transition. I think that for the majority, life was better in the soviet Union, the change to democracy came about without any safety nets thus leaving a people without the knowledge, skills or capital to survive in a capitalist system.      I have lived in Ukraine for 3 years and I have to say that, despite the fact that people are often much worse off financially, the most important effect has been mental. Peoples' outlook on life appears to be extremely different, if a little insecure. Unfortunately, thanks to the influx of American propaganda, Ukrainians are never allowed to let their turbulent past rest. Clinton came and talked about Democracy - and then the Ukrainians laugh at the most undemocratic Presidential election in the history of modern democracy!      It seems to me that Russia is undergoing a rather turbulent evolution, but at least evolution is a more peaceful process than revolution. Every country in the world can look back nostalgically on the ""good old days"", but doing so won't bring them back. The best chance of future success is to face up to the future with confidence and determination, rather than dwell on the past.      Yes, life was more stable and life standards dropped significantly for most Russians. And when the Russians are hit hard, they eventually bounce back even harder. Check their history. Soviet nostalgia coupled with hard lessons from recent years is what will only expedite their recovery. Politically Russia is no longer in transition, but economically they have lots of catching up to do. Wise contries are seizing the moment and make friends with this great contry while it goes through difficult times. The benefits will be more than Soviet Union could ever offer.      This is a transitional period. The country has made a big change and this has resulted in mass unemployment and business loss. Which in turn leads to economic problems which lead to crime. It will be some time before they recover.      I cannot understand why the only two options for the Soviet peoples are supposed to have been ""remaining communist"" or becoming ""hard core capitalists"". Gorbachev tried to find a middle solution --a Soviet nation ruled by the people (rather than by elite dictators) and still being able to compete with the West when it came to political and social freedoms. He and his political allies were not allowed to complete their efforts --not by the people, but by the cold warriors of the KGB.      To ""Jojo in Canada"": I have lived in big cities & small villages in Russia & Ukraine), and speak the language. So I can comment on this subject. That system was cruel to both Man and Nature, much more so than ""capitalism"" has been in the West. Saying some things were done well (trying to defend the system) is like saying ""Hitler wasn't so bad, look he gave us the Beetle & the Autobahn!""      Russians have had to deal with a drastic increase in preventable diseases, a precipitous decline in living standards and have been reduced to paupers looking for cheap jobs in the West. The collapse of the totalitarian Party was a good thing - no one wants to return to that. But the collapse of the system that took good care of babies born in the hospitals and made sure that people had adequate nutrition has brought untold misery. Everyone I ever met while living in Russia wishes that the Soviet Union were still around - but without the Party.      I have to take issue with one statement I have read. It is NOT the state that makes democracy work - it IS the people. Take a look at recent elections in the UK and the USA where the percentage of people voting has dropped considerably. That is damaging to democracy. Democracy works best when everyone takes part.      If the Germans got misty-eyed over the Third Reich there would be an outcry. But here we are getting nostalgic for a system that murdered far more people than Hitler ever did. But hey...that's OK, because the murderers were left wing and they weren't killing people because they were from a different race, they killed them because they simply didn't agree with the Party.      The problem isn't the move from communism to democracy but rather how it happened. The transition was simply too quick, so the old structures collapsed before new ones were in place. We should welcome Russia back into the European fold and offer them all the resources and expertise we can to help the country. The Russians are a great people - resourceful, courageous and innovative.      I personally think communism and democracy are the same - neither works. If you want proof, then look at all the nations in the world and see for yourself - are they really better? Some governments are spying on their own citizens and the media control what they want you to see and what they don't. So you tell me, is it worse than communism or not?      For any nation genuine democracy is very difficult to obtain and equally as hard to hold onto. However, what can be better than ""rule by the people?"" With the Soviet system the Party decides what is best for the people. Don't the people themselves know what is best? I hope the US will do all it can to help Russia and the CIS during this transition to democracy and to aid in the process of building up their economies.      At least the Cold War is over and the threat of WWIII is less of a threat, although the potential to blow ourselves up remains. Remember Threads? Spine chilling stuff, if you remember this film, then you will remember the fear that was around in the 80's.      How many people on this list have ever even been to Russia? How can you possibly comment on this subject? I wouldn't even try, except to say hats off to Andrei Kiselev who spotted that westerners are far more likely to believe their own propaganda.      I read in many places that Russian independence day is Aug 24 1991, but who are we independent from, the soviets? We are the soviets.      Just because communism in the USSR was corrupt the first time around, is that a good enough reason to entirely scrap socialism in favour of capitalism? The best thing for the people of Russia and for the general good of the evolution of humanity would be to re-attempt the socialist state but without the corruption of dictators, without the censorship or the cover-ups or the murders.      Life was VERY difficult mostly because of the lack of freedom and, also very important, lack of opportunity for the bright and industrious without the proper connections with the ""nomenklatura"". It is not so easy nowadays but the chances are much better for many people. There is only one deficit in Russia - money. This is much better than to spend hours queuing to by some basic goods of inferior quality.      Ten years ago, I was packing my suitcase to spend my year abroad in the Soviet Union. A year later I returned from Russia. Yesterday's dyed-in-the-wool has become today's technocrat. Has life improved for the average Russian? Well, for those people who've read Turgenev's ""Mumu,"" the dog's no better fed, but it can bark as much as it likes.      To those who say they miss the fondness of patriotic fervour, I say that is a state of mind that can be changed within your own mind and heart. Being able to live a free life (travel, engage in political debate or religious exercises, build a personal business) is something not to be taken lightly and should be protected. Love your country, but most importantly, love (and guard) your freedom.      My great-grandparents left Russia to escape the oppression of the Tsar. The oppression of the Tsar was replaced by the Soviet Union. The problem, I believe, is not that people yearn for the old days but that the change was too sudden and abrupt. To declare democracy in a country where people have forever lived under an autocratic government--be it communist or monarchy--is too drastic to do in one swoop.      We, Russians, all are missing the kind and heartful spirit of Soviet people of those days. Too cruel we are nowadays due to 10 years living in the world of money supremacy. Being always famous for our beautiful soul, we must do our best not to lose it fighting for the best place under the sun.      I have a grandmother who is not political. She tells me that in her young days she felt more patriotic and proud of her country, and that the country could be depended on to look after you like a father. She tells me now that she has lost that feeling of security in the state government and I think I can see why.      I'm currently on a long holiday in Ukraine. Ukrainians tell me that their communist bosses just 'changed jackets' to suit the new 'democracy', so nothing has changed, with the ex-communists in total control, even of the prime minister, via the Mafia. Tax is so high that the only way to do business, so I'm told, is to cheat the taxman. The Ukrainians I have spoken to are despairing of change for the better in their lifetime due to the corruption and believe it will take several generations for light to appear at the end of their tunnel.      The discussion about the passed away Soviet Union is, largely, a conflict between collective and individualistic components of our psychology. The USSR was a unique large-scale experiment where the collective part of human consciousness had superiority over another natural part of human nature - individualism - without any outcome for the latter. So, the contest between individualism and collectivism is absolute rubbish because it is a no-win game. History confirmed once more that only social formation with self-adjusting systems can survive. Fortunately or unfortunately capitalism is the only one of that sort.      I was in a band who toured in the Czech republic shortly after the velvet revolution. We stayed at many people's houses on the way and spoke to many young and old. The main points seemed to be that since ""freedom"" they no longer had guaranteed houses and jobs but they did have the ability to travel. However they couldn't travel because there were no jobs, therefore little money and what money they had was spent trying to keep their homes! I invited many of them to come and visit but to this day none have come but they do email me.      It is clear that living standards for the vast majority of people in the former Soviet Union have declined since its demise. It is also debatable how much more political freedom they have. This is not to hold up the USSR as a model system, but the issue is hardly black and white. I would ask advocates of our current system, where they would rather be a poor peasant, in communist Eastern Europe or in one of the 'triumphs of the free market' like Guatemala, Salvador, Bolivia or Honduras?      The Russians born in 30 years time will think that it was worthwhile transferring from a Soviet to a capitalist society. It is those who should be considered, not those who like to look back in fondness of a time where everyone in Russia was socially dead.      After 70 years the Russian people wanted a change and who can blame them? Now they realise that democracy is not all Disneyland and Big Macs. Unless there is a concerted improvement, there will be a socialist backlash equivalent to that seen in the early 20th century      Freedom has its price. Perhaps uncertainty is part of that. The state is not an entity in itself, separate from the population. The state is made up of people and it is they who make democracy work.      It constantly amazes me how Westerners hark back with nostalgia to the old Soviet days. We should note that the Russian people look back on Communism only with relief that it is over and with hope for the future.      In response to Steven James - Why does the west have to help? No one is helping Britain with asylum seekers, the breakdown of our national railway, the appalling service that is the NHS, the rise in violence and drug related crime etc. It is not our responsibility to assist another countries' governments in implementing policy and it would be extremely ironic if we did as this government does nothing to help its own people. I wish the eastern block well in its development but it is a path that they have to take alone and learn from their own errors, not be mollycoddled by a country that can't even give its own citizens decent transportation.      It's easy for you people in Western countries to find fault with everything in Russia. In fact, you are quite blind to realities because whereas people in the Soviet Union were suspicious of Soviet propaganda, people in the West believe the official versions of their governments without ever questioning them. Nobody in Russia wants the Communists back because Communism was exactly the opposite of what it claimed to be. What people do want now is some security in their lives, and not to be left to the ravages of the market and the mafia.      To Mark M. Newdick, who thinks that we have 'seen the light': I'd prefer to have my job, and let him see the light. Another thing: I can think for myself, and that is not the reason I'm without a job. Go and tell your laid-off workers in the US and UK that they are without jobs because they cannot think for themselves, and see what they tell you.      I moved to the UK about a week before the coup in 1991. I never went back there. But I have heard so many stories about it now. Lots of real life programmes were made about the lifestyle there now and how people are oblivious to, say, a shooting - I think it's very scary. I was going to do Russian with economics at university this year, which would involve taking a year out in Moscow. But now I am changing it to just economics, I just want to give Russia time to recover.      History has dealt the Russian people a bum deal, be it various forms of corrupt, tyrannical rule or foreign wars and invasions. As a people, they were always under a yoke of some kind. Nevertheless, as tragic as the Russian modus vivendi is (and has always been), this great people possess spirit and integrity. Left to their own devices, Russians will stand proud again. The Soviet/Communist experiment failed, but I believe Russians have been instilled with the nobler communist ideals. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Russia will stand firmly on its feet, and through its rich history and experience, will again balance the American yoke imposed on the rest of the world, and check this awful 'pax' Americana.      Coming from an ex-communist country myself, I can say that people feel nostalgic because in the past they couldn't get fired and they had a job for life even if they didn't always turn up for work or do much. People were given jobs not because they were needed but to keep them happy. My mother was a bank manager and she could only get rid of someone if they were sentenced to jail! On the other hand, I have never seen a homeless or a hungry person until I moved to West - it was a big shock to me. Now most of Russia is hungry and the ""wild west"" principles rule - it is only natural people will long for the past.      I am glad the Soviet Union collapsed. After the Iron Curtain was removed, I have received a chance to study abroad and get the education which neither my parents nor my grandparents dared to dream about. The life during Soviet times was good only for those people who liked the government to ""think"" instead of them - knowing definitely what was best for them to study, to know and to do. As a result, many of them find themselves now with needless specialities and without profitable skills to support their living. They are upset now because they still believe it is someone's responsibility to solve their problems.      Just read Anthony Bullock's post, it is absolutely bizarre. Stalin was responsible for as many if not more deaths than Hitler! He starved people to death, built government schemes with slave labour and ran a system of death camps. How can you possibly think that the average person was treated fairly well?      The former Soviet Union's economy was powered by the Military Machine. This military build-up literally produced thousands of jobs and was a boon to the economy. Unfortunately for Russia, this build-up proved to be too costly for the country and Russia was unable to compete with the US militarily. The result? A military breakdown with the loss of jobs thereby collapsing the economy. So, yes, the Russians were actually more prosperous under the old Soviet regime but they will in time build up their ailing economy.      Since the changes happened recently the ex-Soviet region is in a state of transition. People are suffering a great deal because the country is changing to the free market and democracy. I would like to see much more generous economic aid for Russia from countries like the UK and USA to help them through the very difficult period of change that they are facing.      My wife is from the former Eastern Bloc and when I visit there it is clear, especially amongst the older generations, that people are not used to taking responsibility for their own economic and social well being. In areas where unemployment is increasing the prevailing attitude is that 'the government should provide jobs - as this is what they are elected to do'. I agree with Mark Newdick it takes time for a culture to adapt to a completely different level of responsibility and during the transition these countries should be helped in this process.      Russia has been appallingly neglected by the West and it is no surprise that many of its citizens yearn for Soviet days. Fundamental changes need to be made in Russia before it becomes a full democracy but the country and its long-suffering people need Western support.      Yes it was better in Soviet days. I was in the British military living in Germany to keep the Russians out. Tax-free booze and cars, it was great. Emm is that what you mean?      I am a firm believer in Stalin's policies - in his native Georgia he is still revered and treated as a hero, which has to tell us something. There is a substantial body of evidence that most Soviets were well-treated under his regime. I think that the automatic assumption that ""capitalism is good"" may be true in some cases, but not all. China does not seem to be doing too badly at the moment (rising prosperity of the people, host of the Olympic Games etc).      In the past, when I visited the USSR on business, I could walk freely down the street. Now under the new regime there has been a huge increase in organised crime, so now I am ferried by taxi from my hotel to the offices 'just in case'. As I am driven through the streets you can see the decay and poverty. I guess that is freedom, but the ordinary man on the street has paid a huge price to get it.      I would rather make half the world hate me to live with decency, than read so many sympathising comments about how pitiful my country's present is compared to its Soviet past - although it is true that Russian mentality (culture and spirituality) has major problems fitting in with the money-driven world. Thanks, everyone.      It depends I suppose on how you define freedom. Freedom for the rich to exploit the poor? Freedom for the gangsters to terrorise the weak? Freedom to starve to death? Freedom for the corrupt to plunder and extort? Welcome to the wonderful world of capitalism.      Unfortunately the people who are in power today in the various former Soviet republics are the same people who were in power ten years ago and are not genuine democrats or reformers. With these people in power who still have a communist mentality and are corrupt and authoritarian, is there any realistic chance that things could change?      After all those years of leaving it to the state to do the thinking and planning (if that's what they called it), it is obviously going to take a long time to get people to think for themselves. Russia deserves our support and respect for seeing the light ... nobody said it was going to be easy! "
HOC HOC-GI -0.05 " There is no ""cycle of violence"". This would assume that both sides are equally responsible. The Palestinians in this case are clearly the aggressors. From the very beginning they have directed increasingly violent attacks on innocent Israeli citizens. Israel has, in the meantime, shown incredible restraint in defending her citizens against murderous attacks by only targeting known terrorists and pinpointing the sources of attacks. To equate acts of self-defence to terrorism and murder is morally reprehensible and irresponsible journalism.      Israel's feet-dragging over the implementation of the Oslo accords and numerous UN resolutions respectively is the prime reason for the violence we see. Why is Iraq continuously bombed and starved for not complying with UN resolutions (Israel doesn't) and ""developing weapons of mass destruction"" (Israel possesses nuclear weapons)? Oh, sorry, Israel is a strategic ally of the West. Double standards anyone?      It's obvious from reading the comments that there are people who will blindly support and rationalize the wrong and immoral actions of whichever group with whom they identify. There will only be peace when enough people on both sides refuse to accept violence as a solution and admit they both have made mistakes. Peace is not simply a goal - it is also the means to that end. To get peace you have to act peacefully and honestly.      It's too bad that 53 years ago the Arab people were unable or unwilling to accept the Jewish settlers returning to their homeland. With all the economic advances in Israel the Palestinian people would have been much better off today had they been integrated into the Israeli state.      They have just to learn that they have to live along with each other. The solution is to have a government that represents both the Arabs and the Israeli like many other countries with different ethnicity. We have to face it that there are both Arabs and Israelis and we cannot say to any of them go away      It's clear to me that the biggest hurdle in the whole peace process is the fact that the Palestinians are split into so many factions and there is no one group to have peace talks with. Arafat can't control any of them, he is just a figurehead, Hamas and Islamic Jihad both pay him no mind. They need to become a real nation with the people actually united and willing to follow someone's lead before any peace negotiations can go anywhere.      The only honest Arab point of view openly proclaims a war against Israel. There is no cycle of violence, other than the endless attacks that never needed ""justifications"". This website records a history of bomb attacks against Israel. From 1994 till 1998, there are fifteen dates, all during the height of the so-called ""peace process"". What acts of ""provocation"" or ""retaliation"" did Israel commit to allow its enemies to justify their murderous attacks? None. Israel gave up control of territory and the ability to act against its enemies. In return, the enemies continue to attack and to blame the victim for fighting back. There can be no hope for peace as long as the world confuses ""aggression and defence"" with ""a cycle of violence"". This confusion is a key element in the propaganda war being waged against Israel.      If you think that this battle in Palestine is about religion, then think again. This is about a nation that is battling to obtain fundamental human rights. We have seen what happens when you deny people what is naturally theirs. Remember the apartheid regime that caused so much pain in South Africa. Please look at the parallels that are occurring in Palestine today. Can this cycle of violence be stopped? Yes! Absolutely! But only when we learn to recognise and overcome our own prejudices.      As long as the settlements remain in the West Bank and Gaza and their highways criss-crossing the Palestinian territories, Israelis can only dream of security and peace. Settlers will always be a fair game and will always be targeted by the Palestinians. Peace or no peace, the settlers and their settlements must go, if there's any chance for peace.      Calling for peace now is like putting a golden crown on an abscessed tooth. And since the rotting and decay is kept in the Palestinian areas this will suffice for Israel. Israel's idea of peace is to keep Palestinians poor and economically reliant on Israel. Israel has never tried to improve the situation in the West Bank and Gaza, and never have they treated Palestinians as equal human beings. Since before the formation of Israel it has been the stated policy of the Zionist movement to clear the area of its Arab inhabitants. They were so efficient in doing so that the generals felt sorry for their own soldiers for having to commit such brutal acts.      In doing so Israel turned a peaceful Palestinian population of farmers into a population of resistance filled with hate. If Israel wants to know were the suicide bombers were reared they only have to look in the mirror. The Palestinian resistance ""violence"" must continue until the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine is ended. Why should the thief be allowed to sleep comfortably on the bed he has stolen and in the house he has stolen, while the rightful owner is sleeping in the street?      A nation of people who have lost everything - including their land, identity and basic human rights - know that they cannot lose any further. Such a life is worse than death. No doubt why so many Palestinians are willing to face Israel's bullets, tanks and sharpshooters. Unless a concerted effort is made to restore the rights taken away from this nation, the UNO and the world leaders stand to face the blame of being hypocrites. I would have liked to believe that Jews, of all the people, would be against any kind of persecution - but seems even history has short memory. And now persecuted have turned persecutors.      Israel is condemned for acting in self- defence while innocent people are blown up on a daily basis. What kind of arrogance, smugness and ignorance is being displayed by all those constantly blaming Israel for the violence? There would be no cycle of violence if Arafat was a man to talk peace to, if there were no DAILY terror attacks in Israel, if Arafat would stick to agreements and seek a diplomatic answer. How much terror does the world expect Israel to take? How much would the world take? Most people who write in these forums have obviously never seen the aftermath of a bomb. I hope for your sake it stays the way.      Violence will never end unless Israel stops the occupation of Palestinian land. When you have a people that have been living like animals for over 55 years, must have special licence plates to drive, special identification to walk, no flag, no passport, no country to call their own, no jobs, limited food and medical supplies, no freedom etc. What do you expect the Palestinians to do? Any logical person will fight on until their basic rights are preserved. This is the core of the Intifada ""fighting for basic rights to live like everyone else in the world"".      What is to be expected from Israel? How should they respond to the violence? Simply withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza would only encourage Arab-Israelis to create their own Intifada. Should Israel simply bleed to death so as to appease the Palestinians? What concessions are the Palestinians willing to make, if any? What kind of peace is there to look forward to? The peace between Israel and Egypt, and with Israel and Jordan doesn't mean too much. Israelis cannot visit either country, and both countries spew anti-Israeli propaganda.      The only solution to the Middle East is to make the countries of the area economically tied to one another, so as to create a motivation against violent confrontations. However, I highly doubt that most of the Arab countries, whose population is mostly impoverished and poor, would like their people to focus on their own internal problems than the external ones of Israel. The same could be said of Israel as well. People would no longer have to be victims.      With regard to the comments of Mark Morris - how can he suggest that Israel cares about what other people think when they flaunt international law and agreements and ignore the protests of foreign governments? Both sides are as bad as each other and until one of them is prepared to stop the violence nothing will change.      The violence can be stopped only if Israel stops annexing the West Bank and Gaza. The occupation should end. To build confidence, Israel should immediately lift the blockade of towns and villages so that Palestinian civilians can resume normal life. Talks between Israel and Palestinians should begin forthwith under the mediation of the United Nations to work out a peace agreement based on equality between the two peoples. All UN resolutions should be implemented and there should be an immediate cessation of hostilities between the two parties.      The trouble with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is that everyone ends up blind and toothless. The violence will stop the day everyone involved realises the truth of these words. Or when everyone is dead. The choice is theirs on both sides.      Well said Bob Brown of Australia. I couldn't have put it better! Look at all the wars based on religion, Ireland (Catholics against Protestants), ex-Yugoslavia (exterminate the Muslims), WWII (exterminate all the Jews) Sri-Lanka and so on and so on. Religion seems to be the root of all evil. Politicians are next to religion - they only seem to make things worse. I don't believe there will every be a solution in Israel during my lifetime!      Israel tells the Palestinians to collaborate in the fight against terrorism and to hold the extremists at bay etc. All Israel does meanwhile is destroy Palestinian police headquarters and so on. How do they expect the Palestinian authorities to do anything??      Steve from London speculates about the backgrounds of 'suicide bombers.' He believes they are lonely, confused or somehow brainwashed young men. First of all, to term them suicide is a direct insult to Islam, which honours those who give up their lives to protect their religion, nation, and family. In Arabic, they are termed martyrdom operations, or just 'operations'. Every soldier knows they can be going to their death in any battle or operation, and unless we call all battle deaths suicides, it is unfair to see that as some kind of aberration. Secondly, if Steve took the time to read the news, he will find that many of the bombers are married, have families and children, and even successful careers. Their families are cared for by charities. For example, in Bahrain, a wealthy businessman pledged to care for the family of a recent bomber for the rest of their lives, including education, housing, etc.      Yes the violence can be stopped. And the only way to do so is through education. Many comments on this page show the inaccuracies and falsehoods on both sides that poison the search for peace. However, the biggest falsehood of all is that one's enemy is some sort of subhuman demon and that it is therefore OK to kill him. Palestinian and Israeli schools should employ teachers from the other side and teach about the history and religion of the other to promote reconciliation from a young age, rather than subject them to propaganda or, even worse, military training camps!      Let me point out an interesting dichotomy. Israel has been using the media for many years to promote peace and coexistence between Jews and Arabs. A simple glance at Israeli programming proves that. On the other hand, official Palestinian television encourages children to become martyrs and kill Jews on a daily basis. How can we then speak of Israel and the Palestinians at the same level?      I am in total rejection of any talk of peace without the stopping of violence from the Palestinians! Let them stop the suicide bombers then the Israelis can talk to them. That is the bone of contention - security for both peoples. I say with no reserve whatever. If the Palestinians want to play hard then the Israelis should play hard. Who doesn't want peace? We all do, but not when one sparks fire and calls the fireman who is trying to put out the fire an arsonist.      You may think I am a Zionist but I am far from that. The world is being hoodwinked to blame the Israelis. But haven't the Israelis stretched and overstretched way back to great limits and made very brave concessions? Come on U.N who is the real aggressor? Arafat is powerless to stop his people. The only reason he is still living is because nobody wants to think of a Saddam taking hold of power in the Middle East!      It is always appalling to witness the deaths of innocent people, whether it be caused by the chaotic suicide bomber or the calculated sniper and air attack. However, Israel must share in the blame for the latest suicide attack, not only for its provocative policy of extra-judicial executions, but also for its clear disregard for international law. The UN has set out clear guidelines by which an occupation army must abide by, and one of these is the prohibition of building settlements and allowing civilians onto occupied lands. This is explicitly to protect non-military people from taking part in the occupation, and being used as a human shield by the occupation force. Israel is playing a dangerous game by putting its civilians on the front line, to be caught in the crossfire between its occupation and Palestinian resistance.      It seems insidious that a protagonist of the current wave of violence, Mr. Sharon, is now voted Prime Minister; that Israeli strikes at Palestinians who MAY undertake terrorist acts are viewed by Israeli politicians as legitimate at the same time as they berate Palestinian attacks. Can the cycle of violence be stopped? Only when moderate politicians on both side carry the majority of their people with them and terrorist acts are seen for what they are acts of war by both parties on each other.      Peace cannot be achieved in the Middle East for the simple reason that Israel occupied Palestine, forcing Palestinians to seek refuge. They are carrying out an assassination policy against Palestinians. How can Sharon ask Arafat to stop his ""terrorist"" attacks, when he, himself, has begun an assassination policy. To me, what Sharon is doing is worst, because he's a hypocrite; he says one thing and does another.      That land belongs to Palestinians and anyone who says that they should give up fighting for their land has no idea what it means to love one's country. Most Palestinians can only defend themselves again the bullets with stones. To ask them not to retaliate is absurd, because we have seen Israel retaliate repeatedly. Neither side wants peace because neither has stopped the violence. Palestinians want their land back, and Israelis have nowhere else to go. Therefore, it's a deadlock, with little hope.      The violence will stop when Arafat is held accountable for the war he started last year, and when the world forces him to stick to the agreements he signed yet consistently breaks.      The cycle of violence probably cannot be stopped. It continues in the Balkans, in Ireland, in Rwanda and Burundi, in Afghanistan, and in dozens of other places. There is no hope of peace in Israel, and those who wave olive branches are wasting their energy. These two peoples hate each other deeply, and will not be happy unless they are creating pain and suffering in each other's camps. Killing one's enemies brings a certain satisfaction to embattled people, and both camps feel embattled.      There can never be peace between Israel and the Palestinians unless the fundamental issues of Jerusalem is resolved. The failure by either party to acknowledge the right to exist of the other, will forever, negate any peace accord or treaty. It is pitiful that the Israelis and the Palestinians see it fit to destroy the lives of their children and their children with irrational hatred, and saddle generations to come with the misery that they and their forefathers have had to bear. All for no other reason than blind religious intolerance.      This cycle will not end till Israel is driven out of the area. The Palestinians and Israelis will come to an agreement and then it will be broken. No other country is doing anything about it. The West is with Israel and the East is with Palestine.      This must be one of the saddest episodes of human history. Israelis and Palestinians, how shameful is it to have history record your futile and callous attempts at annihilating one another. Surely, Jehovah or Allah never meant for his followers to bring such disgrace to his name.      This is a reply to Mr M M Zaman and his lovely stories - instead of complaining about Israel reaction why don't you ask the PLA leadership to stick to political negotiation without supporting terrorism at the same time. Without terror Israel will not have to exercise its military power and you could refer to the discussions in Camp David where your beloved chairman made up his mind not to decide and ever since he has been hiding behind terror and incitement. The blame is on your own people who choose the route of a physical fight rather than political negotiations.      If you think that one-sided terrorism is justified than think again - Israel has the power and will use that power in order to secure its safety and the big looser will be the Palestinians.      Even if the violence can be stopped, how long will it stop? The so-called occupied territories are a result of the 1967 war when the Arab countries tried to destroy Israel. Israel won that war and took over land that history records as theirs. It is time the Jewish people stopped caring about what other people think and protect themselves.      What is behind a suicide bomber, I wonder? Well, I gather that they tend to be males under 30 with no wives and children. The sort of people who are vulnerable perhaps. They have not experienced the joys of life and perhaps are unhappy. They are heavily pressurised into ""doing the honourable thing"" and are driven there by car, perhaps by their mentors. They are Palestinians, brought up to hate Israel, and dumped in the middle of Israel with a bomb. Well what choice do they have at that point? By then I expect it is too late. The simplest way out for them is to pull the cord that ends it all. Once they realise this, perhaps they will have more options.      In response to the letter from Jack USA about Britain's response to mortar attacks. Well, we've been bombed before by the IRA, but you don't see us occupying the Republic of Ireland, bulldozing Catholic houses in Ulster, using air strikes against Sinn Fein or assassinating Sinn Fein/IRA leaders. Please don't try to characterise the rest of the world according to what Israel (or its sugar-daddy, the US) would do.      The leaders of both sides have too much to lose both politically and physically (remember Rabin) by being seen to give in to the other side's demands. Arafat and Sharon cannot make peace without the overwhelming backing of their electorates and, more importantly, their political entourages. Can you see this happening soon? I think not.      The ""cycle of violence"" will cease when the world forces Arafat to cease his war. When the aggressors stop their attacks, those defending themselves need not retaliate. WWII stopped when Germany and Japan surrendered. This war will stop when Arafat is too forced to do the same.      The violence will never end until religion is recognised as a dangerous mental disease and those who attempt to inflict this horror on children should be prosecuted with the same fervour decent societies prosecute any person deliberately spreading a physical disease. Religion is Aids of the mind, horrible in the misery it causes.      Human rights, freedom, and universal tolerance are extremely beneficial assets of any society. Unfortunately these are only the top layer which should rest on a solid foundation of law. What the Palestinians need most badly are the efficient law-enforcing and law abiding institutions.     Religion is the root cause of these troubles. People should be asking themselves how to peacefully integrate and why in the name of religion they are fighting.      In short there is no law, in its civilised meaning, behind the Green Line, and the law and the accountability of the Palestinian government is the only prerequisite for peace.      What a lot of people don't realise when they say that Israel has to get out of ""the territories"" is the small size of Israel. If you were to take all of Israel you could lay it between Lands End and Dover almost exactly. Now take a big bite the size of Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and Berkshire out of the middle. That's the size of ""the territories"".      What's needed is a realisation by the Palestinians that succession is not feasible and by Israel that the Palestinians are here to stay. In a country that small there is no choice of splitting it. They're just going to have to learn to live together.      Israel expects that the Palestinians accept without resistance the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, whilst Israel itself is in breach of the Geneva Convention in settling the occupied territories and defies all U.N resolutions which it dislikes. As long as this continues, there is not much hope for peace      Yes, the cycle of violence can be broken. The real question though is 'how soon' and 'who can break it'.      The last suicide bombing is nothing but a retaliation to the recent Israeli assassinations of political Palestinian figures. If Israel wants to break the cycle, it could. The problem is Sharon is too far involved to stop it. The issue of 'when' remains the most crucial but remains bleak in the foreseeable future.      I can only repeat words of Former Prime Minister Golda Meir: ""We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than hate us"".      The terrorists who kill innocents in Jerusalem are the made of the same cowardly stuff as the IRA murderers here in the UK. They murder innocent and defenceless people in order to perpetuate a circle of violence and further their aims of destruction. No country can allow itself to give in to terrorism, only dialogue can solve problems and dialogue can only happen after the thugs have been contained by their own people, who should be decrying and denouncing them.      The Israelis must learn this simple truth: If you want the violence to end, you must leave the Occupied Territories. We Americans had to learn this lesson in Viet Nam - if you don't want your child to die in Viet Nam, take them out of Viet Nam. What we are seeing now is the continuous effects of violence begetting violence, all due to the fact that Israelis should be in Israel, not the Occupied Territories.      The cycle of violence will not cease with the current attitude of Ariel Sharon. With each passing day, his policies are deepening the hatred of the two peoples against one another. The proposals put forward by the Mitchell report need to be fully implemented by both sides. I don't think this situation will be resolved any time soon. Both sides have growing support for hard-line groups and this will only make things worse. I would also like to express my deepest sympathies to all the innocent victims of this terrible conflict - both Palestinian and Israeli.      I think Jerusalem should be made an independent state rather like Monaco. People entitled to call themselves natives should be those who lived there prior to the setting up of the State of Israel and their offspring together with those who currently live there. This, at least, should stop part of the fighting since it could then belong to neither side.      How can Israel tolerate watching innocent men, women and children being murdered just because the Arab nations do not agree with Israeli government policies? The UK does not tolerate the IRA's acts of violence. Why should Israel tolerate Hamas? There is NEVER any excuse that can justify killing innocent civilians.      Perhaps it would be better if there were not so much international publicity given to the issue of Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The so-called Islamic Jihad in various parts of the world given much publicity tends to become more menacing. Give it dead silence and let less people know about it. It will die a natural death. Publicity helps to boost the ego of those concerned.      Palestinians should follow the Mahatma Gandhi's principle of peaceful resistance rather than the violent means they follow. Unfortunately, violence creates more violence, which will never end for a long time.      The solution to this has been alluded to in one of the earlier emails - American resolve. Instead of words, the US should cut off its donor aid to Israel, which strangely exceeds all the donor aid given by the US to Africa. Since violence requires weapons and fuel to perpetuate it, then denying the stronger side weapons will rapidly put a brake on matters. However the only people losing out in this struggle are Israelis and Palestinians, and the US military machine gets fatter on the proceeds of arms and keeps consuming more cheap oil from the pathetic Arab regimes. Hey, but what the heck, the US economy is booming! God bless America.      The escalation of violence in Middle East reflects the failure of the international community to impose its human rights principles on both sides of the conflict. Understanding terrorism is therefore a key element in finding solutions. If we define terrorism as ""the last stage of provocation"", we might seek the solution in the elimination of the cause rather than tackling the manifestations. At this point in time the only hope for eliminating the cycle of violence is to remove the cause and the Mitchell report might be a good road map.      Israel should now kick out the Palestinian Authority once and for all. Enough with trying to satisfy the rest of the world. Kick out the PA and make real security borders away from the 1967 borders so that the Palestinians can't strike at Israeli cities.      Wasn't it the UK who refused to talk to terrorists? How the legitimate government can be expected to talk to the leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad when the official aim of both is the destruction of the State of Israel? As long as those organisations act freely in Arafat's territory, as long as he refuses to announce a zero tolerance policy towards them, as long as hate-schools exist in Palestine, he - Arafat - is responsible for the killings. Israel should retaliate and give a direct signal to all the Palestinians, that the state is not prepared to talk to those who endorse the bomb attacks.      The cycle of violence can only stop when 1) The state of Israel stops the murder of innocent Palestinian civilians and acknowledges that its policies are the root core of the problem and 2) the USA stops blaming the Palestinians alone and puts equal pressure and blame on the Israelis. The world will no doubt rant about the ""Arab Murderers"" as will the Israeli propaganda machine, however, let us not lose sight of the fact that more children have been murdered by the Israeli army than all of the suicide bombings put together. That is not to say that the murder of any child is condoned in any shape or manner whatsoever. Israel must respect the sanctity of Palestinian blood if it wants its own children to be safe.      Yes, these cycles will be stopped when people start thinking and stop following somebody or some book blindly.      The Israelis have full right to protect their citizens. They have full right to target terrorists even without a trial - in such a war there is no time for trials - ""he who arises to kill you, kill him first"". The only way out is for Israel to take a hard line and stand up for itself. We saw that after the six-day war all the Arab countries lay still. The world should realise that all Israel wants is a country to live in and that includes all of Israel which was given to us by g-d. The Arabs must know that, if they continue, hard retaliation will follow and the Israeli government should do exactly that and not with some pathetic response. That is the only way for peace!      Ed Sasson is wrong to say that Arafat is responsible for the failure of Camp David. According to Robert Malley, a member of the US negotiating team at Camp David, Barak and Clinton used the negotiations to set a trap for the Palestinians. The talks were ""designed to increase the pressure on the Palestinians to reach a quick agreement while heightening the political and symbolic costs if they did not"". This was done even though Barak had not implemented previous promises made by Israel to clear illegal settlements and give the Palestinians a State under the Oslo accords.      The only way left for a lasting peace in Middle East is total and complete withdrawal of Israelis from the area occupied since the 1967 war. No Muslim and Arab country can accept peace till that happens. Meanwhile the Israelis, having all the weapons in the world, could go on slaughtering the Palestinians in retaliation. This will lead to even bigger tragedies, for Palestinians have nothing more to lose except their lives. I believe many people in Israel oppose what Sharon's Government is doing to Palestinians. I don't see any hope for peace till a bigger tragedy brings some sense to the current administration in Washington to actively push for a lasting settlement.      The simple answer to your question is 'yes'. All that needs to be done is for Israel to abide by UN resolutions on Palestine. They should end their occupation. Clearly, the policy of the present government to subjugate the Palestinians and to terrorise them will never work. Lessons should have been learned by now, but then the blinkered Israeli politicians have not learned from their previous miscalculations and until they do, resistance to their continued occupation of Palestinian land will continue.      As long as Palestinians have access to Israel there will be a very few who will successfully carry out acts of suicide/terror. It's a nightmare that's impossible to prevent without denying all Palestinians access to Israel. Somehow I think that might be seriously considered right now.      There are groups on both sides of this conflict that hold extreme views that cannot be a part of any compromise. And these groups (I believe they are minorities) have power and influence. The Palestinian extremists demand the ""Jews be pushed into the sea."" The Ultra-Orthodox Jews believe the whole of Palestine must be united under Jewish rule in preparation for their Messiah, hence the settlements. Religious conviction can't be rationalised away. I am afraid this cycle of violence will continue until both Israelis and Palestinians find themselves exhausted, afraid, and tired of life. Only then will these peoples be ready to make the painful compromises necessary for a lasting peace.      Israel has endured a state of war by its hostile Arab neighbours for 50 years, resulting in this ""occupation"". Every sovereign nation has the right of self-defence. Apparently, Israel is denied that right, being told to exhibit ""restraint"". How many mortar rounds or suicide bombers would Britain or France allow in London or Paris without a firm response?      I grow tired of seeing Israelis killing Palestinians, then Palestinians retaliating. It's obvious that these two sides will never reach an understanding. Their leaders should either call its quits or settle this with war once and for all. Stop beating around bush!      While every right thinking person will deplore terrorist bombing, it must be understood that the Palestinians feel an overwhelming sense of frustration at the total lack of progress towards a just settlement. The West, and particularly the US, base their responses on the voting power of the eloquent Jewish lobby, rather than an equitable solution, and violence seems inevitable. Arafat's position is precarious and any sensible negotiator would realise that he has to deliver something to his 'constituents'.      It's simple and easy...hate produces hate and attacks produce revenge and the cycle goes on. Sharon is looking for unrealistic goals, his policy of a complete stop to violence before negotiation won't get him anywhere. If he thinks that security can be achieved but destroying homes and confining people, he's wrong and his ""security plan"" is obviously not working.      Arafat ordered the release of Hamas and Islamic Jihad prisoners from Palastinian jails at the start of the present violence. It is no surprise that terrorist attacks are being carried out by these organisations as they are opperating with impunity inside the Palastinian Authority controlled areas. Until Arafat starts to re-arrest the terrorists that he originally freed none of his statements of ""condemnation"" can be taken seriously.      I don't understand how any sane, free-thinking individual can possibly characterise a suicide bombing as ""resistance"" or ""protest"". Call a spade a spade: these acts are mass murder, and there is no excuse for them -- whatsoever.      Clinton promised both Barak and Arafat that no blame would be apportioned to either side but true to form, he then pointed the finger at Arafat in front of the cameras. This is a general pattern with Israel: it breaks promises it makes and then blames Arafat for them. Israel blamed Arafat even while it was invading Lebanon in 1982. Israel should be careful. Without Arafat, do they think they will be able to negotiate with Hamas or Islamic Jihad?      I find no immediate solution. I pray for the common citizen of both countries. I feel that peace will only come after much more pain and death. May God help us all.      Yes, cycles can be broken. We are human beings and can say enough is enough. Politics and not force can break this cycle. The first ingredient for resistance is occupation. Israel has had 50 years in which to work for peace but on her half century elected a leader promising more land and delivering only blood from both sides.      We have seen many fingers pointing to the Palestinians for the cause of the violence. However, the cycle of violence is evidently caused by Sharon's use of excessive military force. How can violence be stopped if it is being instigated on bigger terms through the use of helicopters and tanks against the Palestinian people and their children?      The cycles of violence can be stopped. Both Palestinians and Israelis need impartial observers to verify instigators of violence after a period of calm. Unfortunately, the blood thirsty radicals on both sides; Ariel Sharon on Israelis side and Hamas + Islamic Jihad on the other, are reluctant to see peace in the region. ""Dogs of war"", tearing each other's apart.      The situation could have been different if Yitzak Rabin had survived the bullets. The only hope for observable peace attempt is if President Bush steps in and say 'enough is enough'. Otherwise, there seems to be no hope for a people linked by common heritage and deep seated hatred for one another. May God help us all!      Sharon instigated this cycle of violence and now the people of Israel will pay for it. How can anyone expect the Palestinians to remain complacent when day in and day out, they are being killed and repressed? If nothing is done from the Israeli governments side to put a halt to their violent actions, then they should be prepared for more suicide attacks.      I lived in Jerusalem for 6 months 12 yrs ago, and often went about my business in the very area the bomb went off today. The Palestinian terrorists are targeting Israeli civilians, which is clearly wrong, but they must feel that since so many Palestinian civilians have been killed, it is their only answer. The Israeli response in all this has been nothing but provocative and incendiary. Sharon has no interest in making peace, never has had and never will have.      The Palestinians must realise that the world doesn't look kindly on terrorist attacks on innocent civilians. If the Palestinians really want to win concessions, they should protest peacefully in front of the TV cameras. Then, when the Israeli army does what it does best and murders unarmed Palestinians, the tide of opinion may swing back their way.      Israel has been oppressing the Palestinians for more than 50 years. They can't expect to oppress and find no resistance. When the Israelis voted for Sharon they simply voted for more of such bombings.      Both the responses of Margaret Carre, Belgium and Bob Brown of Australia represent the ignorance many people have of this conflict. The belief that this conflict is based on Muslims wanting to destroy all Jews out of intolerance is dangerous because it leads to support for Israeli oppression of the Palestinian people (many of whom are Christian). This is a dispute over land and self-determination. The West must forcefully demand that Israel end its occupation of Palestinian land to prevent this violence from spreading. "
HOC HOC-GM -0.07 " IF speed cameras were placed where there is a real need, and IF realistic limits were set, and IF there was consistency across the country, I would support cameras. As it is there is none of this. How much would the accident rate be affected if the money was spent on more road safety training in schools, more public information films on the TV and better road maintenance? Surely removing the cause of an accident is a more important target than lessening the effect of the accident?      If speed cameras are so successful then let's have more of them! Also worth considering is having more signs clearly indicating the local speed limit, even showing decreasing limits every 30 miles as one leaves the motorway or approaches town as they do in France. That way there is no excuse for not knowing what the speed limit is meant to be.  Forget speed cameras. Could we instead have cameras set up specifically to record abusive, ill-mannered and downright dangerous driving and have the culprits charged accordingly? If we could stop the 'smart ass' driving and bring back some manners we could cut road rage considerably.  If reducing the speed of vehicles at an accident black spot will reduce the number and severity of accidents then speed cameras are a useful road-safety device but if they are catching large numbers of motorists over the speed limit then they aren't doing a particularly good job at reducing speed. Making the cameras more visible would seem to be a good way of actually making them effective. As an aside, a recent series of trials in Scotland managed to make dramatic cuts in road accidents by introducing ""advisory"" (i.e. not enforced) 20 mph limits in residential urban areas. It may well be that there are more effective and less costly solutions than speed cameras.  This is a sensible suggestion. Deterrence is the best strategy. Now let's think about the speed humps that are ruining my car's suspension.  At the moment, drivers learn exactly where the cameras are and slow down when they approach them - hidden cameras may mean more people are caught. More cameras may help, although how much is unknown. What IS required, are greater penalties for speeding, e.g. caught once, banned for life. Since driving is a privilege and not a right, I don't believe this can be argued against.  As speeding is breaking the law, cameras, concealed or otherwise, are fair. Ken Williams does not want to alienate motorists; perhaps he doesn't want to alienate burglars by catching them, or robbers, muggers, rapists, murders, etc.  I do believe that speed cameras do make drivers go slower and will reduce risks of serious accidents or worse. However, I do not believe in speed cameras for the sake of it in order to generate revenue. I would fully support the open use of cameras in built up areas where the car is a threat to pedestrians. However, I mostly see them on faster open roads where most drivers can use their common sense. Placing the cameras here is just a very cynical way of getting even more money from motorists who based their speed on sound judgement.      In many US States the police have to provide speed advisory units when requested by three members of the public. These units display the current speed limit and your speed. These are left in an area for two weeks. Then four weeks later the police set up radar. Surely prevention and education is better than alienating the public from the police by fining without warning.      Spend more time fining those idiots that park in bus lanes, double yellow lines junctions, etc. If the roads flowed better, drivers wouldn't have to feel the need for speeding to make up lost time etc.      I'd rather see heavy penalties for tailgaters - one of whom has just written off my new car.      I would love to see more speed cameras in town, and at accident black spots, instead of the speed bumps that allow all the fat cats in their wide cars to go as fast as they want, while I have to go at 5 MPH over them or risk having my suspension ripped off. But they should be more visible of have more appropriately placed signs so that people are not slamming on their brakes at the last minute. On places such as motorways and open roads cameras for braking distance would be far more effective at catching dangerous drivers.      I can't believe that people are so blinkered as to believe that speed is the primary cause of accidents. Careless idiots who just pull out into traffic without looking are the real cause, but speeding is easier for the police to target which is why it gets all the attention. On motorways they should crack down on idiots who sit in the middle lane as they are dangerous and cause congestion.      All the comments so far have laid the blame for accidents at the driver who is driving ""too fast"". But in most cases it takes two to cause an accident. Very often the driver who is speeding is the one who has priority and who hits the car or pedestrian who has actually caused the accident by being where they shouldn't be. Yes, spend money educating drivers, but also educate pedestrians, cyclists and other road users that the ALL have equal responsibility for making sure that they don't cause accidents. The speeding motorist is not the only villain of the piece.      I feel that speed cameras have a place on Britain's roads, the only problem is that most of them are in the wrong place! And there is only a limited amount of places that they are needed      Everyone on this page whingeing about ""stealth tax"" and secret revenue building - well, boys (and I bet they all are boys), the answer is simple. DON'T BREAK THE LAW. You all seem to think that you are better judges of what is a safe speed than the people who set the speed limits - umm, I don't think so. Rather smacks of the cat guarding the canary. Accept it and move on. In any case, as has been proved on the M25 and the occasional lower speed limits, slower speeds mean fewer bottlenecks which means fewer traffic jams which means... do I have to spell it out? I vote for digital speed cameras, hundreds and thousands of them, all working 24/7 sending instantaneous details via modem. O, and I ride a motorbike and drive a car.      If the law listened to half the 'citizens' on here then we'd be looking at a situation where each person would decide what speed is right for the road, every road would become an autobahn and more people would be killed. But every day I see the actions of drivers who speed and tailgate others that dare to drive at the speed limit - they wouldn't care less. My message - stop breaking the law.      Speeding motorists have resulted in chicanes, speed bumps, cameras and other calming measures which are a pain for everyone. It's quite simple really, don't speed and you don't get caught. If you think speed limits should be greater, take it up with your local council, but don't speed. There is no excuse for speeding, whatsoever. If more hidden cameras can help adjust motorists attitudes to speeding, let's do it!      If a sign says 30, accept it and drive at 30. It's all very well saying ""let drivers use their own judgment"", but regrettably a large number of drivers think that it's perfectly safe for them to drive at 60mph in a 30 zone. Are we supposed to say ""oh well, they judged that they could do that, so we can't complain""? Even if the limits are ""arbitrary"", people should have the intelligence to realise that there is a reason for the limits. If you can't drive in accordance with the rules, you should walk.      Speed cameras are a bad idea. If you are driving the posted speed limit of 55mph and everyone else is driving 70mph, you are the greatest threat on the road. Yet the speed camera would ticket someone who is moving at the speed of traffic. Speed limits are ridiculously low and have not been updated since the 70's. Cameras cannot use judgement to see if someone's speed is dangerous or a threat to other drivers. Only a police officer can make that sort of judgement. Now cameras for running red lights is another thing. That's just dangerous no matter what. Put cameras at traffic intersections instead.      What I've found personally is that speed cameras that point forward make me slow down. The idea being that you are timed between 2 different cameras, at different points on a road and your average speed is calculated. They are far better than the 'ordinary' cameras that do nothing for road safety.      Most police officers will tell you that speed in itself isn't dangerous, it's the INAPPROPRIATE use of speed that is the problem. Using speed cameras to enforce limits is a an easy political option. We really need to tackle all the issues relating to poor driving such as tailgating, inattentiveness, use of mobile phones, aggressive driving and so on. The driving standards need to be much tougher, even to the extent of having licences taken away from people before they commit offences or have accidents. We should have to prove competency to drive on a regular basis. Pilots have to do this, why not drivers?      The statement which introduced this conversation thread is derived from yet more mis-information released by this government who seek to establish support for their unfair revenue generating schemes by incorrectly reporting that this is what the people want. One look at the entries contained here will prove to any doubters that this is not what people want at all!      The next time you see a section of road where the speed limit has changed from 70mph to 50mph and fresh new cameras are installed, it will be pretty clear what their real purpose is. Law-abiding drivers today are being made to become socially unacceptable drivers tomorrow - all for the sake of revenue. And what about new roads that have cameras from day one? Shouldn't the road planners be prosecuted for building an obviously ""faulty"" road? Let's make sure they are only used in the real accident blackspots from now on, so we don't all lose what little respect for cameras we have.      In a democratic society such as our own, does the fact that a vast majority of a nations citizens willingly and openly break a law (speed limit) call into doubt the validity of that law? The point in a democracy is that the government rules with the consent of the governed. Why not put a box on our road tax reminders asking if we want more speed cameras? If not, the government does not have our consent! The day will shortly arrive when these expensive speed cameras will be destroyed in their hundreds by disgusted motorists (citizens).      As to those who tow the 'don't speed, don't worry' line, I'll expect you to be out of your local not a minute later than 11:20, and don't dare sip a drink or adjust your radio whilst driving - that would be reckless - and stay out of the middle lane!      As a car driver I hate speed cameras with a vengeance, but they are the only deterrent that works. I would like to see a great increase in visible speed cameras as these reduce injuries on the roads. I would suggest that the money raised from fines be used to improve the roads and public transport, as car drivers are paying far too much in road and fuel taxes.      The Government's own figures show that only around 6% of accidents are caused primarily by drivers exceeding the posted speed limits. The rest are caused by plain bad driving. Speed has been demonised, with the result that numerous bad drivers smugly assume that they are 'safe' drivers simply because they stick to the posted limits, despite the fact that they tailgate, undertake, pull out without looking, use mobile phones, and sometimes drive too fast for the prevailing conditions. If cameras were placed in areas of high risk I would be delighted, but they are not. They are hidden in areas where there can be no other reason for their existence except as a revenue generator. As a result the speeding laws have already fallen into total disrepute.      I'm all for more speed cameras. In Sydney, the problem lies with the media - radio stations broadcast locations of the newest speed and radar cameras, urging drivers to slow down. That just defeats the purpose - if you are moronic enough to be speeding in the first place, get caught and lose your licence! Warning louts like this just adds to the problem. On one hand the police are busting their guts trying to crack down on people who speed, on the other hand you have the media just contributing to the problem.      Modern cars are faster and safer with better brakes than the cars that were around when certain speed limits were introduced. Dual carriageway and motorway speed limits should be increased, and the law relaxed on these roads. Speed cameras in accident black spots are fine, but when there is a 40mph zone with a camera in the middle of a nowhere on a wide open road then surely this is just revenue building? Why don't the police think about re-jigging the whole system rather than just introducing more cameras?      It has been proved time and again that speed does not kill, it is going too fast for your own ability to drive. Everyone thinks that they are the world's best driver. The police should deal with ""dangerous"" drivers not ""fast"" drivers. A cyclist doing 15mph can easily cause a crash by not being careful. Speed cameras should only be put in black spots, outside schools etc and be painted in bright colours so everyone can see them from a long way off and not have to slam their brakes on as they approach them. The anti-driver lobby should think what would happen if the police decided that crossing the road anywhere except in designated areas became illegal. How many of them would stick to the law and always use crossings? Please less hypocrisy, scare-mongering etc and a little more thought.      My main concern with speed cameras is that once I enter an area containing them I tend to watch the speedometer more than the road. In the event that a child was run in front of your car which would be the worst scenario for the child, to hit them at 30 mph because you were watching the speedometer not the road, or to hit them at after breaking from say 33 mph because you were watch the road rather than the speedometer? We need to control speed better especially in built up areas but I don't believe speed cameras are the safest answer.      If you do not speed then what is to worry about? Anything that can cut down on bad or dangerous driving is welcome in my book. I hate those jerks that tailgate you on a 30 MPH stretch of road. Also gadgets to warn drivers about speed traps should be illegal to sell and possess. If you have a device to warn you of a speed trap, that can only mean you intend to speed before and after the speed trap. I would welcome more patrol cars or more cameras.      I am so sick of the "" I'm alright Jack "" attitude of drivers in this country. The immature desire of so many drivers to speed is staggeringly pathetic. Speeding costs innocent lives. It is as simple as that. What is more important, a human life or a childish need to pretend your are a racing driver? Drivers who feel the need to break the speed limit should get a grip, grow up and show some consideration for other people. It is breaking the law, if you do it, accept the consequences. In other words, grow up and take responsibility for your actions. More speed cameras please. With a view to removing all these idiots from our roads, making them a safer place.      I look forward to when everything is cameras and there are no traffic police. Then I can cover my number plates with mud, the cameras will not recognise me, and there will be no police to tell me to clean my plates. More seriously, evidence shows that conspicuous cameras reduce speeding more that hidden ones, and that is the purpose of these cameras. Hidden cameras are used to make money, not slow drivers down.      What happens when we all start driving at the correct speed limit? The revenue from the cameras drops to zero, and the taxpayer ends up paying for a load of cameras that never get used. More police in cars is the only way to go - stop all sorts of dangerous driving, not just speeding which in many cases is not dangerous.      I am a professional truck and bus driver, and my view is that rigid speed limits are dumb. I have always driven and will continue to drive according to the conditions on the road and the amount of other traffic present. I have financed my degree in computing science by doing the driving job during the last 4 years, and I have noticed that as soon as the police were allowed to keep some of the money collected in fines for themselves, not only one can see them driving around our housing estates in Mercedes and BMW cars, but also they started to actively clobber people with fines whenever their coffers became exhausted by extravagant purchases. Do they really need fancy cars to do their job ?      As for the point made by the chief constable on the Radio 2 on Thursday about the figures showing that speed cameras save lives, I am aware that statistics is what one wants to use it for, and it would not be the first time that people in power con the public into accepting some proposal while using suitably adjusted statistics to make their point. As for me, I remain very sceptical.      Using speed cameras is all well and good so long as it is part of a wider strategy. To this day I have never seen a camera outside a school, hospital or old peoples home but I have seen them hidden behind obstacles on steep hills and dual carriageways! Much like the speed bumps that have become a landmark in many of our towns all they do is cause danger as those who travel the roads regularly slow down and then accelerate away afterwards and those who don't know about them slam on their brakes!      With the proliferation of speed cameras the signs that used to warn of an accident black spot seem to have disappeared. It seems that the authorities would rather collect a fine than prevent an accident. So much for safety orientation.      Local authorities are spending so much money and time on these cameras that they are forgetting the real problems of people not wearing seatbelts (back and front), passing on the inside on motorways and general disregard for the rules of the road.      Has anybody tried driving around at exactly on the speed limit. The bullying tactics of other road users is incredible. Tail-gaiting, dangerous overtaking, you feel really, really pressurised into going faster and this is in areas where speed cameras are prevalent.      The comments from some people that they are better qualified than the authorities to determine the safe speed at which to negotiate a particular section of highway is simple minded arrogance! What these people fail to appreciate is that the speed limit has to take into account driver reaction times (some of these people would be shocked at how slow their reactions are!), winter driving conditions and other road users such as cyclists.      Also, if speed limits on motorways are increased, I believe that once people have shortened their commuting time they will be loathe to increase it to allow for poor winter driving conditions. I say bring on the hidden cameras - if people choose to break the law they should be adult enough to ""pay up and shut up!""      I was fined for speeding along a dual carriagwway travelling at 61mph instead of 60mph. Yes I did technically break the law but do I present such a dangerous threat compared to an uninsured and banned driver responsible for road deaths? Putting up more cameras is going to prove counter productive. Public opinion is divided as to the effectiveness of cameras. More people are likely to be killed in urban areas where hardly any cameras are placed. Yet along motorways and dual carriageways, cameras are springing up everywhere. To me, it sounds like an excuse for the government and police to print more money without catching any real dangerous drivers who are responsible for a majority of inner town/city road deaths.      Cycling along a busy A-road to work, I fully agree with the need for clearly marked, visible cameras to control people's speed. The myth of responsible driving has been totally exploded for me because sadly there's a significant minority of drivers who speed regardless of road conditions or the presence of people (or cyclists!) on the road. In the real world, it's just not feasible for the Police to monitor roads in any other way due to lack of manpower and resources      Those people who think we need more speed cameras to reduce accidents are, by and large, ignorant on what the causes of road traffic accidents are. Speed by itself isn't a danger. What is a danger is people driving dangerously. Not leaving an appropriate gap between themselves and the vehicle in front, not allowing enough time to slow down when approaching traffic lights or junctions, overtaking without thinking about oncoming traffic. These are just a few of the things that need to be addressed, i.e., driving skills. The other important thing is vehicle safety. Cars need to be made more safe. ABS brakes, for example, should be MANDATORY on all new vehicles. My point being there are far worse and more dangerous things about road traffic that people should be looking at, rather than just focusing on speeding.      Yes, more cameras please - after all speeding is breaking the law. But more speed limit reminder signs too, so the 'I didn't see the sign' excuse is no longer usable.      Look, if you give someone a gun they will shoot it, if you build cars that are designed to go fast, people will speed no matter how many cameras or speed bumps there are, unless you cover every stretch of road in the world. Build cars that can only travel at the speed limit of the area they are in, take the temptation away, no speeding then, ever! Plus far less loss of life, but no, no one would ever agree to a 'radical' solution like that!      Speed limits are set arbitrarily by the authorities, not by any scientific method, and as such should only act as guide. Cameras do not and cannot in any accurate way, determine other road conditions which may or may not make it perfectly safe to exceed the speed limit. Cameras should therefore be removed altogether and a traffic only police force set up to control all aspects of driving.      Speed cameras are fair provided the speed limit is reasonable. However, on far too many roads the speed limit is set for political reasons rather than the speed the road can actually sustain. In almost all instances 30 mph is too slow.      Speed cameras are evil devices that promote inattentive and robotic driving. Drivers should be encouraged to use their own judgement to decide what speed is safe on a given road for given conditions, not the number on a sign post.      I agree with highly visible cameras in accident black spots to reduce accidents and in fact these should be placed on all traffic lights in order to catch those who indulge in the extremely dangerous practice of jumping red lights. However, simply relying on cameras to monitor speeding drivers rather than improving driving standards (which the old-fashioned traffic policeman did when he stopped a driver) is now missing, as the police forces reduce the number of traffic police on the roads. Additionally, cameras take no account of time/conditions of the road, as at certain times of the day a speed limit may be artificially low (ie 30mph dual carriageway at 05:00 hours).      The argument that hiding speed cameras is entrapment is nonsense. If you are breaking the law, you can't complain if the law is enforced - you don't get bank robbers complaining because the bank had hidden cameras!      If speed cameras were truly being used to target danger, they would be almost exclusively in areas where speeding is most dangerous - urban and village 20mph and 30mph zones. Were there to be a proliferation in these areas, I don't see much opposition coming from anyone, even the disproportionately powerful road lobby in this country. They will, however, almost certainly be used the same way they have so far - as revenue generators in 50mph and 60mph zones and motorways. Used like that they will remain deeply unpopular, and have little or no effect on road safety.      It's just another hidden tax on the poor motorist. Canada has now removed all of its speed cameras, as police have lost the respect of people who don't want to help them anymore. I agree that cameras are probably needed in built up areas where accidents are likely but I can't see what the point of those new ones on the M6 is except for raising money. It wouldn't be so bad if real crime was falling as a result of the new police revenue stream. Incidentally I have a Morpheous Geodesy which warns me where the camera is a mile before I get there so I can slow down more safely.      I believe the time has long gone when cameras were only used at accident black spots - they are now mainly used to raise revenue. Recently whilst improving a 2-mile stretch of the A12 near Brentwood in Essex I believe I counted 22 working cameras. At certain times of the day these cannot be justified.      Hidden cameras are a good idea in built up areas as long as there are signs advertising the fact, this would mean drivers would know they are there and adhere to the speed limit throughout the stretch of the road instead of learning where the cameras are and speeding in between.      It makes me mad when people complain about speed cameras - if you DON'T SPEED, you won't get caught. It's people who break the speed limit who endanger others' lives. I think there SHOULD be more speed cameras and they shouldn't be obvious because people shouldn't be speeding anyway.      A government-sponsored review found that excess speed contributed to only 5.5% of road accidents. This suggests that the majority of accidents are caused by people who simply cannot drive safely. Also, here in Plymouth there are about 40 cameras. Only 3 have been painted in the new high visibility colours. The rest are lurking behind bushes, half way down steep hills etc. None are outside schools or playgrounds etc. Why?      I used to always exceed speed limits. I was involved in an accident and attended a Driver Improvement Course. After this I have always driven within the speed limits. It takes me no longer to get to work and even long motorway journeys only take a few minutes more when not exceeding 70mph. This is because most of the end to end journey time is spent waiting at junctions or sat in jams. I never have to worry about speed cameras, I use less fuel and I arrive at my destination relaxed and ready for business. Bring on the cameras, at least I know I'll not be funding them!      Andrew UK, I would hope you are in favour of UK motorways becoming more like German autobahns. They have, despite their unlimited speed limits, a lower death and injury rate. Proving beyond any reasonable doubt that speed DOES NOT kill. Inappropriate use of speed however does cause death and injury but that is not a law enforcement issue, it is an education issue. It is perfectly possible to drive safely at high-speed - UK police officers do it every day.      Hiding cameras will not stop drivers from speeding but speaking for myself, if I know there's a camera or I see one on a non-motoway road, I make sure I don't break the speed limit. However, I think cameras on motorways are dangerous as they cause everyone to slow down at the same time. A 70 mph limit on the motorway is unrealistic, it should be raised to 90 mph - it's the only way to get past middle-laners who, along with tailgaters, SHOULD be fined as they are far more dangerous than fast drivers.      I think speed cameras in built up areas are a good idea as long as they are clear. The police claim that speed cameras are a deterrent. Surely if they are a deterrent they should be painted bright yellow to make it obvious to drivers that they should be slowing down. Therefore a real rise in road safety would mean a reduced number of people caught on camera, not an increase. It seems these days speed cameras are placed to make a good profit rather than to save lives especially now the local police forces get to keep a percentage of the fine money. It's time for the Government to tell the truth. Are you trying to save lives or make money. If the answer is save lives every speed camera should be easy to spot and therefore slowing drivers down.      What concerns me is that the current Government is missing the point regarding road safety by putting too much emphasis on speed. If the money spent on speed cameras was spent on driver education then our roads would be a safer place. Most accidents occur due to driver error and speed is only one contributing factor.      More speed cameras? Well yes I suppose not a bad idea, at the end of the day they only help to enforce the law. Perhaps a better question should be are the speed limits set at the correct level for current vehicles, considering that they were set so long ago based only on fuel usage? Perhaps lower in urban areas, but higher where it is safe? Now a lifetime ban on anyone found driving a vehicle without insurance or MOT, that I could support without question!      Speeding does get a lot of press, but in the real world, I see more bad drivers who keep to the speed limit, than bad drivers above the speed limit. The reason that you never see any statistics to show that they are a major cause of accidents is simply that it would be difficult to quantify. Somebody who is too scared to drive faster than 20mph is more dangerous than somebody who breaks the speed limit on an empty road at four in the morning.      Speed cameras miss the point. Speed is not in itself the greatest cause of road accidents, it is without doubt careless, inattentive and irresponsible drivers that cause the majority of accidents. I have seen a great many dangerous drivers at 30mph who assume that because they are not speeding they can 'switch off'. Cameras will not stop this, they will just serve make the average motorist feel like they being constantly watched and regulated by big brother. I agree with the sentiment that speed restrictions in this country need urgent reviewing with a view to increasing motorway and dual carriageway limits.      I agree that camera's should be used in built up area's and near schools. But on motorways or dual carriageways there should be a system as in Germany where if conditions are good you can drive as fast as you like, but if conditions are poor i.e. rain and fog and poor visibility. Penalties for driving dangerously in these conditions are harsh.      The only way that roads would become safer is if speed cameras were placed on every 20 yards of road. Everyone knows that people speed up once they get away from cameras and drop their speed on approach. But if cameras were just about everywhere, then that would give the speeders less chance to speed. But it still doesn't stop joyriding and offences similar to that.      More speed cameras would mean more drivers focussing their attention looking for ""hidden"" cameras, rather than concentrating on the road.      Why does everybody go on about speed as if it is the only cause of crashes? Instead of more speed cameras I think we should introduce new cameras to combat tailgating which is another contributor to accidents particularly on the motorway.      The problem I find with speed cameras is that you tend to look for them and by doing this you are not concentrating on the road, increasing the risk of an accident. I don't think you should be informed if you are approaching a speed camera.      There's no question that well-placed, highly visible speed cameras add significantly to road safety. However, it is also quite clear that badly-placed speed cameras cause accidents. Finally, above all this, bad or intoxicated drivers are much more of a risk, so if speed cameras allow more policing of bad/intoxicated drivers - it would get my vote.      Our local council have managed to reduce everyone's speed to approx. 10mph without the aid of speed cameras. They have re-surfaced most of the streets leaving everywhere covered in loose-chippings, everyone is going slowly with no overtaking or tailgating.      I only believe cameras should be used for safety, that is next to schools and built up areas. By placing cameras on motorways and concealing them this only makes matters worse. How can concealing a camera make a road safer?      Yes, more cameras please - after all speeding is breaking the law. But more speed limit reminder signs too, so the 'I didn't see the sign' excuse is no longer usable.      Look, if you give someone a gun they will shoot it, if you build cars that are designed to go fast, people will speed no matter how many cameras or speed bumps there are, unless you cover every stretch of road in the world. Build cars that can only travel at the speed limit of the area they are in, take the temptation away, no speeding then, ever!

Speed cameras are evil devices that promote inattentive and robotic driving. Drivers should be encouraged to use their own judgement to decide what speed is safe on a given road for given conditions, not the number on a sign post.      I find it extraordinary that anyone should need to ask whether speed cameras are a good thing. They save lives, prevent serious injuries, and thanks to the income from fines, they cost law-abiding drivers nothing. Anything other than speed cameras with these benefits would be instantly welcomed by everyone as a good thing. Why do so many people believe that they have a God-given right to drive irresponsibly?      The argument that hiding speed cameras is entrapment is nonsense. If you are breaking the law, you can't complain if the law is enforced - you don't get bank robbers complaining because the bank had hidden cameras!      If speed cameras were truly being used to target danger, they would be almost exclusively in areas where speeding is most dangerous - urban and village 20mph and 30mph zones.

Used like that they will remain deeply unpopular, and have little or no effect on road safety.      Martin Clapham - The whole point of speed cameras is to prevent speeding. If the cameras are prominent and easy to spot it will only serve to slow down drivers when passing the cameras and then simply speed on when the threat has passed. Making sure that the camera's aren't easily identifiable will ensure that people will stick to the speed limit at all times because of the element of uncertainty. I feel you have misunderstood the reasons for speed cameras and their necessity in helping to prevent accidents.      It's just another hidden tax on the poor motorist. Canada has now removed all of its speed cameras, as police have lost the respect of people who don't want to help them anymore. I agree that cameras are probably needed in built up areas where accidents are likely but I can't see what the point of those new ones on the M6 is except for raising money.

The rest are lurking behind bushes, half way down steep hills etc. None are outside schools or playgrounds etc. Why?      I say give us more cameras! Don't hide them, but make it clear that they are there. I live on a fairly busy road in Surrey, just at the end of an 'S' bend. Over the last 2 years there have been 16 cars and motorbikes crashing into my garden, simply because the drivers ignored the 30mph speed limit and came off the road at the final bend. One of these crashes was fatal. In the six months the police installed a speed camera on this bend, there have been no crashes. Drivers see the camera and slow down, worried about their poor driving attracting a large fine and points on their licence. During this six months, the camera has had no film in it - it's not even connected! Speed limits are there for a reason - often to protect the lives of the drivers as much as the pedestrians. Careful drivers will welcome the reminder to slow down - you'll find only the stupid, selfish drivers will complain.      Well anything is better than more speed humps which have no effect on large vehicles and SUVs but, even at low speeds, bend the suspension on small modern cars. I am sure the number of people killed by this vastly exceeds the number saved by reduced speeds.      The UK has had an excellent road safety record, with constant improvements for over 30 years despite great increases in traffic. However since ""Speed Kills"" and camera enforcement took over from good driving and common sense road safety, we've see the accident figures stagnate. We need intelligent road safety, good driving, and no more dumb cameras clicking like cash-registers.      The recent proliferation of speed-cameras in some areas (A420 in Wiltshire/Oxfordshire for example) coupled with reductions in speed-limits, appears to have been done solely to raise revenue. Concealed cameras result in drivers' attention being concentrated on looking for the cameras rather than watching out for real road-hazards.      I definitely think reform of the speed limits on motorways is needed, but if speed cameras reduce the number of people exceeding the 3O mph limit in built-up areas, which happens all too often, they can't be a bad thing.      Speed cameras are only part of the solution. The UK should adopt the system used in many other countries, where a chime sounds when the national speed limit is exceeded. I think that many people inadvertently exceed the limit, simply because looking down at the speedometer takes eyes off the road. At 70 MPH, even this brief glance can be enough to miss something, and end up with an accident.      S      Speed cameras cause heavy breaking as they slow down not to be caught as soon as the pass the camera then they speed up again. Being safe is the aim but why not be like Germany look at their statistics for car accidents it still is not as high as ours.      The government and police would probably keep more drivers on side if they totally overhauled the speed limit system. Bring speed limits in town down and clamp down hard on those who break the limit, but relax the limits on motorways and trunk roads except in accident blackspots or whatever. The cameras which annoy drivers are those which have no apparent purpose other than revenue generation.      In the U.S. speed cameras have been a great incentive against speeding and running red lights, a major cause of traffic accidents. Our simple ""Speed Cameras Ahead"" signs are way cheaper than spending money on researching ""sniper positions.""      Some speed cameras make driving more dangerous. Especially on out of town roads where the traffic can quite safely travel along at faster than the speed limit, but everyone then has to jump on the brakes when they see a camera. How many rear end accidents happen at or near speed cameras because of this?      In my experience, drivers slam on their brakes as soon as they see a camera and then accelerate once past the markings on the road. Not the safest drivers to be behind (or an endorsement that more cameras will reduce accidents).      The ever-increasing deployment of speed cameras on UK roads is such an invidious policy. Personally, I don't believe that they're being installed for road safety reasons, but rather as another way of funding local police forces. It's a classic case of highway robbery.      What the BRAKE survey actually showed is a majority of drivers support ""well-placed and highly visible"" speed cameras. That is ones situated in recognised accident blackspots, generally in urban areas, and made extremely obvious, not ones lurking behind signs and bushes on rural trunk roads where there is no history of speed-related accidents. That suggests that there should be a complete turnaround from the speed camera policy currently being pursued. There are only around 5 cameras in the whole of the city of Manchester, yet there are about 30 on the 15-mile stretch of the A34 between Stoke-on-Trent and Stafford. Those can't be the right priorities.      In built up areas such as outside schools and hospitals, on roads in town centres and residential areas where children play - YES!! On motorways and dual carriageways with their barriers, single direction traffic and safe entry and exit slip roads - NO!      If you drive down the A1 from Edinburgh to the south it is a complete joke. The cameras only serve to encourage more dangerous forms of driving, speeding in particular, as all that happens is that people who "" know the road "" slow down and speed up accordingly making it a much more distressing experience for anyone trying to keep to the limit. There is also a neatly hidden ""small"" camera, covered by a bridge when you enter from England - discrimination if you ask me. "
HOC HOC-HM -0.05 " Legalise. We should aim to keep young people away from drug dealers where they learn about drugs, just as we try to avoid sending them to prison to learn about crime.      I don't think society is ready to legalise cannabis just yet, because it is clear that, while it is relatively harmless for many people, it is deadly to others and destroys their lives (the same is true of alcohol however.) Legal cannabis would magnify all the health problems associated with booze. However, someday science may discover what the genetic markers are that indicate whether a person who tries something is likely to become an addict. Then all drugs could be legalised but only for people who have been ""cleared"" based on their genotype.  Not only should cannabis be legalized, it should be fully exploited. It is the world's most efficient ""bio-converter"" or producer of biomass per sq. acre. It produces fine cloth, though it uses none of the pesticides or herbicides that cotton does. It can be used more efficiently than corn to produce ethanol for clean-burn engines. Its seeds have the perfect essential fatty acid mix for the human body. Perhaps best of all, it has the promise to end the world's dependency on fossil fuel with a renewable resource that can produce four crops per year in a place like Canada. On top of it, you can sell recreational marijuana for one-tenth the current ""street price"", cut the criminals out of the equation, and get the tax money.  It's about time! So much hypocrisy and ignorance surrounds the drugs debate and I take my hat off to Mr Lilley for having the courage to at least address it. The sooner it is legalised, the sooner the British public (and would it be too hopeful to include other societies round the world )will realise that all the other lies about drugs are just that. Prohibition will fail absolutely.  5 million people x 5 pounds per week (in duty) x 52 weeks per year = 1.3 Billion pounds of money to spend on public services each year.  I think cannabis should be made legal and then all the MPs in parliament be forced to smoke it!!!!!  I am a business director and regular user of cannabis. I am not a Tory voter but would if the plans put forward by Peter Lilley were put in practice. I agree that people are being pushed toward the drug underworld, and for young users getting the option of other class A drugs is inevitable.  I smoke cannabis fairly regularly - I socialise with my friends, have a good time with great conversation and many laughs all in the comfort of the front room at home. I don't stagger out of pubs, urinate or vomit in alleyways, spray take-away food litter on the street or get into fights. Nuff said!  In the present situation, large-scale smuggling and dealing in cannabis is under the control of some very unpleasant individuals. This means that a lot of the money spent on cannabis at the moment is also being funnelled into prostitution, racketeering and hard drug smuggling and dealing. I don't know about the rest of the UK, but in Edinburgh and Glasgow, cannabis means a dubious tarry substance of unknown origin and composition. It certainly bears little resemblance to real Hashish as seen in Amsterdam. Regulation of the trade would reduce harm to people who choose to use cannabis by supplying a higher quality product enabling people to get as stoned as they wish to on less smoke.  England is a sick country. First you got mad cow disease, then foot and mouth, now you want to legalise drugs. What kind of society are you becoming? Are you mad???  How many dope smokers smoke cigarettes because they have to mix the resin into a joint and so become addicted to nicotine? If the leafy version of cannabis was readily available, how many people would stop smoking tobacco? The smell of cannabis is not unpleasant, whilst tobacco and the people who smoke it stink! I vote for legalisation of cannabis and criminalisation of tobacco, if only to preserve my nostrils.  As a scientist, my greatest fear about legalising cannabis is the number of extra lung cancers that will come as a result.      In the USA you have an additional problem however: dependence on the automobile. It is no coincidence that in most of the US you cannot drink until you are 21 - but you can drive when you are 16(!) and nearly everyone does. Stoned drivers would magnify the drunken driving problem that exists, and I don't see an easy way around this.  Don't legalise cannabis. Leave the law on this as it is. It's bad enough having to passively smoke normal cigarettes, I do not want to find myself in a pub or on the tube passively smoking someone else's fix. Politicians should concentrate on more important policies like the repeal of section 28 and not be bothered about a law which unfortunately, obviously isn't being adhered to anyway.  Cannabis should be legalised but approached in the same way as alcohol. There should be laws preventing driving under the influence, as the reactions are impaired. You never see cannabis users rampaging through towns on Friday and Saturday nights, fighting and causing general unrest. Alcohol is much more anti-social than cannabis will ever be.  The time has come for cannabis laws in the UK to be reviewed. 1 in 10 adults smoke cannabis and that's a fact. Why should people smoking cannabis in the safety of their own home, or in a pub, be disallowed by law? I really don't understand why this is. Alcohol can cause violence and long-term health problems, yet there is no medical evidence to show that cannabis causes anywhere near the problems alcohol consumption does. The fact is that most people go on to harder drugs because they are available from their cannabis dealer. if you cut this link, drug dealers will be unable to catch young people into the web of class A drugs. Better still, enable the legalisation of cultivating cannabis for personal use, and it cuts out any money changing hands whatsoever. Imagine the revenue the government could make from cannabis tax?  Have you ever seen a stoned person starting fights, or causing trouble? I think not.  I know you can take cannabis by other means, but most people smoke it. I think it should not be legalised since it would encourage smoking, which is far more dangerous. Find another safe delivery method and I would have few objections.  Cannabis should be made legal along with other illegal drugs. The government have lied to the general public for 30 years on this issue. The UK spend upwards of 3 billion pounds last year on the war on drugs. The reality is prohibition creates a black market that supplies bad quality drugs and introduces users to dealers that try and push more addictive drugs. The argument that cannabis leads to harder drugs is only true because of the way it is supplied - the dealers encourage the use of more addictive higher-profit drugs. Take the dealer out of the link and you eradicate the risk of use of harder drugs.  Morphine (heroin) is proved to have no adverse effects on the body (except constipation). Street heroin contains all sorts of contaminates and the doses are not controlled (thus overdoses occur). A new approach to the use of drugs is needed. In a controlled (taxable) environment lives would be saved and people's health would not be at risk.  Cannabis should be legalised. It's not true that it necessarily leads to harder drugs, just as it's ridiculous to claim that your first pint of beer will lead you to alcoholism. Anyway, I think that if English football supporters smoked the weed instead of gulping down 14 pints of lager, perhaps we would not been seen as violent thugs but as chilled out and happy, man!  It's important to separate what a law says from what a law does. By legalising cannabis you change the nature of the system, and therefore the problems associated with that change. The present system of illegality works! People are effectively free to smoke cannabis in the privacy of their own homes; but as soon as you legalise cannabis you change the culture of cannabis use, which is bound to bring with it all sorts of new social problems. The law is merely a technicality that is used to keep things stable, and with cannabis it is clearly working in a useful way.  Don't the government realise that once cannabis is made legal then they'll have an endless source of taxable income to cream off society? How many hospital beds are worth one joint then?      The ridiculous comment from Emma (UK), concerning the ""Kit Kat"" craving from smoking cannabis should be condemned. This kind of attitude is both frivolous and demeaning to all wanting to enter a profound and serious debate on the cannabis issues. As every cannabis user will know, Dime bars are the far superior.  Two points: 1) If you smoke a lot of cannabis you're going to fall asleep, if you drink 10 pints you're going to be a danger to yourself and others. 2) Anti-legalisation people say all those on hard drugs started on cannabis; you'll probably find they also smoke, drink, eat red meat, watch TV, drink water etc etc.  I drink alcohol and I have smoked cannabis on two occasions about ten years ago. I did inhale and I did enjoy it. Nevertheless in my opinion cannabis should not be legalised, for the simple reason that there are already enough mood-altering substances circulating in society as it is. I am very familiar with the well-rehearsed arguments about cannabis being less dangerous than alcohol, but it is naive in the extreme to think that if it was legalised all the alcohol users would switch to the substance. If legalisation occurred, consumption of all legal (and as a knock-on, illegal) drugs would increase. I do not believe that a more stoned society would be a better society.  Yeahhh..... maaaan!!!!  The argument that something is OK just because something else is cuts both ways. If, as Rob Harris says, alcohol and tobacco are as harmful as cannabis, then they should be 'criminalised' too.  It's time to face the facts. Cannabis is so easily available and legalisation would remove many criminal gangs in one go. Also the issue of drugs needs to be addressed. I don't do any hard drugs but through my 'dealer' I know it would never be a problem to get whatever I could think of. Politicians and the establishment need to pull their heads out of the sand, they have been talking rubbish about the war on drugs for years.  I have never voted Conservative in my life, but if the party officially adopted a pro-legalisation stance, they would have my vote in the future without question.  The war against cannabis, hasn't worked. It's about time my tax paying pounds were spent elsewhere - like on health/ education. Let's take drug profits away from the criminal underworld.  There are more than 5 million regular cannabis users in the UK alone. These people are citizens and should demand their right to choose to use cannabis. After all, it's well known that it is no more problematic than alcohol or tobacco. The idea that cannabis should be illegal by default - no discussion - and that some kind of medical justification is needed to end the persecution of users is inherently undemocratic, and requires a grossly puerile, elitist and megalomaniacal authoritarian mindset.      It's important to understand the difference between legalisation and decriminalisation. There's certainly a strong case for decriminalising cannabis use (dealing is another matter) - after all, do we really want to be giving young people criminal records for smoking a joint? However, to actually legalise cannabis is a much bigger step - controlled sales of the drug through a system of off-licence style outlets would probably lead to a big increase in the number of people using cannabis, with the attendant health problems (mainly cancer). Perhaps removing the threat of a criminal record from cannabis users would be a sensible first step.      Clive from Down Under warns of turning ourselves into a nation of ""fuzzy-headed, crisp eating, TV watching vegetables"". I consider that infinitely preferable to the current situation in town on a Friday night which appears to be fuzzy-headed, kebab-spewing, window-smashing traffic-cone throwing thugs.      This is a civil rights issue. The possible negative effects should be dealt with as separate issues - cracking down on drivers who are affected by any drugs, for example, as they endanger others. But where the harm, if any, can only come to the user, let the user decide what to do within his/her body. Use should never be encouraged, but I do not accept that the State has a right to interfere beyond giving advice.      Mass opinion is not always the same as informed opinion. In this case the majority argument seems eminently sensible. Progressive decriminalisation and control would please the law abiders; squeeze the black marketers; and swell Gordon Brown's coffers, with a probable net gain in social side effects.      It's not a perfect answer I grant you, but then Utopia was never around the corner. I just wish that someone would take the policy seriously instead of saying it for effect and popularity, before conveniently neglecting to put their money where their mouth is come crunch-time.      If you take the principle that if a law does not work you should legalise it then what about car crime, tax evasion, house breaking and oh yes, the oldest profession.      The cannabis laws are outdated in western Europe. Only the Netherlands recognise that cannabis is neither more harmful or any less socially acceptable than alcohol. In keeping with their mature attitude their policy of freedom of choice better reflects both the drug itself and the concept that in this modern age we should be treated as adults and allowed be allowed to make our own choices as free individuals.      Criminalisation of any recreational drug simply does not work. It goes against basic human freedom. It puts far too much money into the hands of criminals instead of creating a new business opportunity for many hardworking people. Billions of dollars are wasted jailing people who are in no way shape or form, a threat to society. May die from drugs that are laced with other poisons. Many more die from drug related dealings and having to purchase a simple drug for recreational purposes from usually violent criminals. Drugs are much easier for youths to obtain when illegal (I know from personal experience). Billions of dollars in tax revenues are lost. Medical research of the potential benefits of these drugs is hindered. There is no reason to criminalise a recreational drug.      I have an alcohol problem, it started when I used it to wind down after work and to get to sleep and then got out of hand. It's been over three years since I smoked cannabis and prior to that I took amphetamine regularly for over a year. I couldn't face being caught with either so I stopped outright with no problems. A year ago the drink started and now I have real problems. Get the priorities right, if cannabis was legal I wouldn't be downing half a bottle of vodka each night.      The legalisation issue is not really of concern to me as the drug is readily available and would no doubt be heavily taxed if made legal. I can't think of a single friend or associate who doesn't smoke cannabis and I believe that the figures often seen in surveys massively underestimate how widespread it's use has become. I see no harm whatsoever in smoking cannabis but do not believe that the Government is mature enough or secure enough to discuss the subject properly. It's seems to me that in the cases of Peter Lilley and others, their only real concern is how the subject will affect their chances of getting a nice new office in Downing Street. As a final point, if I were to bump in to a group of lads in a dark alley, I would feel a great deal safer if they had been smoking rather that drinking.      Legalize Cannabis! I suffer from MS and it helps ease the pains. I know more ugly drunks than happy dopers. I believe the world would be a happier place if everyone tried it at least once in their life time. How many police get calls for domestic violence caused by smoking cannabis over those for drunks? I have dated too many drunks and gotten my fair share of bruises from them, but not from those who smoked dope. I agree that car accidents are related to drug use but it is caused by lack of common sense. Have you ever heard of someone killing another person over cannabis? Not me.      I smoke cannabis, but I do believe its legalisation is yet more ""chipping away"" at societies rules, without which society could not exist. Maybe the good of the majority outweighs our individual desires.      Peter Lilley is to be commended for his good sense. Of course cannabis should be legalised. It is a nonsense to criminalize users of a drug that is less harmful than alcohol. Can anyone remember hearing of a case of domestic violence due to cannabis? It's strange that the zero-tolerance brigade have nothing to say about the huge numbers killed each year by alcohol or tobacco.      Aren't countries like Sweden that experimented with this idea now backtracking because its caused more drug related problems than its cured? Do we want to make another mind altering substance legal and add to the problems social acceptance of alcohol has given us? What message does this send to young people when we say that its OK to take something for no other reason than altering your state of mind, as opposed to dealing with the many problems we have in society? Wasn't the disintegration of the US army in Vietnam partly to do with endemic drug abuse, and what does that say for the effect of this drug on order and coherence in any society?      Legalising cannabis would be a disaster. Full stop. It saps the will to do anything when taken in even small quantities. If you want to turn Britain into a nation of fuzzy-headed, crisp eating, TV watching vegetables then go right ahead. And don't believe the people who tell you that it doesn't lead on to harder drugs - in a lot of cases it does - I've seen it.      I do not use cannabis, nor any other illegal drug, nor do I consume any alcohol. However I believe cannabis should be de-criminalized. They tell us it should be illegal because cannabis may be ""harmful and dangerous"" So are tobacco and alcohol - in the US these kill far, far more people than all illegal drugs combined. I'm sure the same is true in the UK      Cannabis is the thing end of the wedge leading to harder and more deadly drugs. You also create an army of part time drug dealers stepping up to full time hard core criminals selling deadly drugs to the same customers. What would you do then legalise the harder drug as they become more ""socially acceptable"" . Just nip it in the bud and lock up drug pushers rather than give them more oxygen.      There are an estimated five million uses in London alone. If they were paying the same tax as cigarettes the UK would be laughing. And it is hard to commit a crime when your world can be made perfect by the timely arrival of a Kit Kat.      As a serving Police officer I often see the results of drug abuse/use first hand, the ruined lives and destroyed minds. I am all in favour of an informed debate to openly discuss the pros and cons of decriminalising cannabis. As for government shops selling dope and taxing it - that won't stop the dealers and the black market who will sell it cheaper ""tax free""!      After the quality online discussion on this page, I should think that you might have done justice to the issue on the BBC World discussion on TV on Sunday by including at least one proponent of the idea of legalisation in the panel. The discussion raised a number of cautionary points but few of the issues in favour.      I have been a smoker for the last eight years, and still have not found any bad side-effects of the drug. Instead of increasing taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, why not legalise and tax cannabis? Not too much though! Or I would imagine many people would go back to getting it from their old dealers, if the prices shot up.      I have never tried cannabis, but I know many people who do. Sadly, when people buy any illegal drug they can do so only by putting money into the wallets of evil drug barons who resort to violence or even murder to further their aims. We cannot stop people smoking cannabis, so we should at least allow them to buy it from a safe legal source.      Cannabis should be legalised. I do not want to be labeled a criminal for smoking. However I would probably continue to purchase it on the black market if it were legalised because of the massive tax the government would no doubt put on it.      It is not, as a lot of people have said, astonishing that the Conservative party have aired this idea of decriminalisation. The Conservative Party, as anyone who has followed politics will know, has a libertarian tendency that at its most radical suggests the legalisation of all drugs. The Labour Party has never been associated with the liberalisation of anything.      I am pleased to see that the ever-present ""Gateway drug"" theory is getting a good hammering. The anti-cannabis lobby has repeated this rubbish over and over again, never realising that it is not proven and is a total fallacy. I know dozens of cannabis users (myself included) who have never taken hard drugs.      I can not really see the sense in not legalising cannabis. Anyone can obtain it, anywhere. It is used recreationally by millions of otherwise law abiding people who are all aware of its non-threatening, relaxing qualities. Every weekend I see people traumatized by the effects of a night using alcohol. The cannabis users I know dont appreciate aggression. Amsterdam is an eye opener, to see how a society has embraced change for the better. I truly believe the people of this country are more scared of 'change' than anything else. Give our country a chance to grow, ethically and financtuly. Let the UK be a guiding force for the future.      Present smokers are more far more likely to take to smoking cannabis than non smokers. Cannabis is much more expensive than tobacco. Cigarette addicts are already depriving their families of income that could be better spent, and now these same families might be faced with a bigger hit if cannabis were legalised. Those of you who espouse freedom of individual choice, please start thinking of the spouses and children of addicts!      How dare David Davis state so glibly on Breakfast with frost that Holland is a drug based society? Not only is Holland, in general a more law-abiding society than the UK but hard drug use has declined there over the last ten years not increased as Mr. Davis insisted. I do not take drugs myself but I follow events closely and Holland is a beacon to the rest of the world for common sense programmes.      Imagine all the good things cannabis tax revenue could be spent on. Imagine all the good things that the money wasted on policing cannabis users could be spent on. Imagine that cannabis users no longer have to come into contact with harder drugs. It is about time that we wake up and see that the United States policy of forcing the world to ban this drug has been disastrous.      I believe that cannabis should be legalised, but restricted, much as smoking is now. That way it would free up so much in the way of police resources (as well as the extra tax revenue for more police) so as to be able to fight truly dangerous drugs and the evil people that supply them. Think of the knock-on effect on drug related crime if the police could target heroin or crack properly, without the distraction of prosecuting someone with a couple of joints in their pocket. Maybe London's streets may start to feel safe again!      Imagine the British image in the near future - a bunch of socialist, chain smoking, ecstasy dropping, pot head, lager louts rioting over some football match result. A fine healthy ""socially progressive"" reality for your future.      I have been smoking cannabis for 20 years. The only problem that I have had with it is when I was busted with three grammes of hash and lost a good job because of having my name splashed in the local paper. If those in power really cared about our health, then they would have banned tobacco and alcohol products years ago.      The drug war is a colossal and corruptive failure that punishes the lower class unjustly. I believe alcohol and marijuana are parallel substances as well, except for the fact that alcohol is more of a plague on America what with all the drunk drivers who end up killing people and because of the violence that alcohol encourages. Industrial hemp needs to legalized more than anything as it is a viable resource that will save our forests.      After just leaving Amsterdam from a weekend tour I have changed my mind on the whole legalisation talk. I believe that ""special outlets"" similar to Amsterdam's coffee houses should be allowed, for the main reason that alcohol is not allowed in those places. Now think how many crimes are alcohol-related, and how many are cannabis-related! I think people are much more likely to go to these coffee houses than a bar. Therefore surely a reduction in crime may be the result.      Legalise it to get it out of the hands of criminals, but ban it from improper use, just like alcohol or tobacco. Oh, and then we should be able to grow that useful plant hemp again.      In more than 30 years of voting, I have never voted Tory. But if they adopt the policy of legalisation of cannabis, they may just get my vote. (Gulp...)      ALL drugs should be legalised. It is down to the individual's choice whether they want to destroy or kill themselves, not the choice of the government behaving like a nanny state, or campaigners and do-gooders constantly drumming down our throats how we should live and behave. Our society needs to take a long good luck in the mirror. We must stop dictating to people and getting wound up over peoples' actions and opinions.      It's good to see a range of opinions on this talkboard, because just as a hypocritical prohibitionist attitude to cannabis and other currently illegal drugs helps nobody, neither does the common attitude amongst young people that smoking cannabis does you good, and has positive effects on society. Like any drug, we use it, then rationalise our vices by exaggerating the positive side, and tend to forget that the mental effects of smoking cannabis (especially for people who have experienced forms of depression and the like) can be extremely traumatic. Like all forms of drug consumption, it is an inevitable but harmful practice in our society, and the law should take this into account by some form of decriminalisation, whilst using legalisation to exploit the potential benefits of its use for conditions such as Alzheimer's.      I find it funny that some of the people that say it should be banned are the same people that smoke and drink, both are more harmfully to our bodies and society. Cigs are more addictive than heroin IMO, and booze is responsible for so much crime. And as the weed being a gateway drug, I would like someone to show me someone that didn't try booze or a cig first, THE REAL GATEWAY DRUGS!      A comment on the theory that cannabis is a ""Gateway Drug"". It quite simply is not. Yes, it is true that every heroin addict, every cocaine user etc. has taken cannabis... But then, every meths drinker has had a pint of lager. One does not cause the other! Legalise cannabis now! It's a prohibition. It is hypocritical of the government to say No to legalising cannabis, but to allow the advertising of tobacco, a far more deadly drug.      I believe that drug use is escapism. Maybe if the government improved the situation that the country is in and paid a bit more attention to what the country is doing rather that what the opposition is doing, there would be little use for drugs. If cannabis is to be legalised it should only be allowed in private. Public use should be banned, same as it should be for smoking of all descriptions. I find it offensive and if you want to ravage your own lungs, please don't take mine down with you.      If the above quoted tax revenues are accurate, that combined with the money saved with police time, and decrease in criminal activity (because its no longer against the law) would certainly help the country. The health risks are not really any much more greater than smoking, and the THC in cannabis is NOT physically addictive; nowhere nearly as addictive as tobacco. In response to the unknown long-term effects of cannabis, as they are unknown, it is foolish to base a law on this - it would be easier to study long-term effects if legalised. I also believe it is also the individuals choice to take or leave the risk of smoking it; I find the nanny state becoming a little sickening, and more than a little irrational.      I don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco, but I do enjoy smoking cannabis. I believe it causes less harm than either alcohol (no violence) or tobacco (no addiction and less inhaled smoke per day). I also believe in freedom of individual action, along with responsibility for self-inflicted harm. Yes, legalise it.      I want to see cannabis legalised, but not commercialised. The last thing on earth I want to see is the tobacco companies getting in on the act and promoting use of dope, although maybe Ken Clarke would disagree. I would like to see the law changed so that you can legally grow your own plants at home. I also agree that its simply crazy not to use cannabis as a crop, because it has so many uses.      It appears that the UK is ahead of the curve on drug decriminalisation. Kudos and keep up the good work! The political climate in the States is, as in George W's words: ""Incarceration is Rehabilitation."" Ah ok George, snort another line.      YES. Because a government entity should not control peoples' choices... And how can someone have the ego to ban a natural plant? Do they believe they have the power of a god to control something like that? It's even safe for the human body!      Never, never, never!      Hats off to Mr. Lilley for using some rationale and logic in pointing out the absurdities and silliness of this ""War on Drugs"" garb. The message being conveyed by governments around the globe is pure psycho-babble. They can justify the use of tobacco and alcohol when the two combined kill over 500,000 people a year in the U.S. alone? If somebody would please present factual, documented evidence of the number of people killed as a result of MJ a year. I would love to see. No one has been able to provide this information so far. Seriously, a lot of people are getting really tired of it! A lot of tax money is being spent and little results are being produced. This is completely and totally unacceptable.      I can't see this move working in the UK. It works in Holland apparently, but that is a completely different culture. The points about cutting out the underworld are very valid but people will still be able to get other drugs should they want to.      The problem with the legalisation of cannabis lies in the lack of an effective test for driving whilst drugged and the legal implications (in terms of financial liability) for any government legalising somthing that later turns out to be more carcinogenic than tobacco.      I think it is really daft that people who like to ""indulge"" in using cannabis to relax and stimulate their mind should be classed as criminals - there's such a stigma attached to that but it is okay to drink every night and that surely damages your body more anyway? I also however think alternative ways of taking it should be investigated. So many of the negative comment mentioned here and the medical issues are because people smoke it primarily. What about a new line in alco-pops? From what I've heard the effect Redbull and vodka have on you is almost illegal so, why not? And a lot of people agree that it is much nicer to be in a group of stoned people rather than drunk people, much more calm and relaxed and less aggro.      Cannabis is the biggest cash crop in this country, smoked by millions of people from all walks of life. Those who complain that legalisation or decriminalisation would lead to the use of harder drugs should consider how effective an attack on hard drug pushers we could create with the taxes we could gain from legalisation of a drug that is less dangerous and more prosocial than alcohol.      Should drugs be legalised? Of course they should. The profits at present are enormous. Terrorist organisations use the profits for arms purchases. Drug Barons use the profits to intimidate those who threaten their income. The taxpayer funds the costs of customs and police operations. Then pays for the users and sellers to go to jail. The high cost of drugs are born by the community, but the gains all go elsewhere. If economics can be used as an argument to close hospitals, schools and throw people out of work it can surly be used to legalise drugs.      It's quite amazing to think that a Conservative minister would talk more sense on this issue than Labour. Now that it is obvious to all that New Labour = Old Conservative, perhaps New Tory will become a truly radical political force? Unlikely perhaps, but I certainly shan't be voting Labour again...      Legalisation of MJ should be done to start a legalisation process all over the world.      The overwhelming support here for legalising cannabis confirms my long-held suspicions about the kind of people who write to Talking Point.      End the hypocrisy  End the lies  Just legalise...  Lead on Britian.      I believe that the education given to most people about what cannabis is, its uses and position as a so-called ""drug"" is greatly misleading. Firstly cannabis is not a drug, it cannot overdose and it is not addictive. The effective ""high"" cannot be a reason for criminalisation, since alcohol and all the arising ""legal herbal highs"" are present in legal, mass abundance. I know many people that use cannabis and none have ever used any hard drugs and are actually fully against cocaine and heroin. Cannabis is not a gateway drug.      Hemp has tremendous potential as a source of industrial, medical, nutritional and social benefit. The only reason I can possibly conceive for it not being taken full advantage of is that the ""old money"" corporations see how much money they could lose, and lobby strongly against it. Or am I just paranoid?      Cannabis is NOT just a mild and pleasant drug for some of us; it is a potent toxin which severely impairs our cerebral functioning. Taken repeatedly by such people it can lead to irreversible damage and even psychosis. Please don't forget this.      You may disagree with what I do, but when I smoke cannabis in the privacy of my home, I am not hurting or stealing from anyone, so therefore, in the nicest of ways, mind your own business.      Have our puritanical politicians learned nothing from the Prohibition period?      Look into the initial reasons behind cannabis prohibition in the US, and you find not an interest in public health, but a racist smear campaign by William Randolph Hearst to protect his wood pulp interests from cheaper, more competitive hemp products. Hemp was cultivated, used, and smoked for thousands of years with few ill effects, its reputation destroyed by a powerful US newspaper baron hell-bent on getting his way. The potential benefits of industrial hemp to the environment, paper and textile industries, and of smokable hemp to chronic pain sufferers and victims of many painful diseases, greatly outweigh any ill effects on society, many of which are the result of prohibition, not the drug itself.      Yes cannabis should be legalised, otherwise alcohol and tobacco should be outlawed. But prohibition leads to terrible problems, as we already know. I used to be a long-term dope smoker and heroin addict. The only reason I started taking heroin was because it was supplied by the same illegal dealers whom I used to be obliged to visit to buy my dope. Otherwise it would never have crossed my mind to embark on 18 years of pumping poisons into my veins. Those people who repeat ""parrot style"" that smoking dope leads, automatically, to hard drugs clearly haven't sat down and given the subject any real thought or taken the time to study the infrastructure of the illegal drug culture.      No it should not be legalised because it IS addictive, and living with someone who sometimes ""needs"" 50 pounds worth of the stuff a week is depressing and expensive. Not to mention increased health risks and less safe driving. More people on cannabis would cost the health service an absolute fortune. For god's sake DON'T DO IT.      It is difficult to argue that drug laws have been in any way effective over the last 30 years. It seems that the law has completely failed to control what is generally perceived to be a problem. Therefore in order to move forward, new ideas must be examined. Whilst we are all too aware of tragedies that have occurred as a result of drug use, it is rare that the media represents those people who use recreational drugs in a sensible manner and have an enjoyable experience with minimal risk. These people form the majority of drug users.      Decriminalising cannabis would have more positive effects than negative. It could reduce the level of violence in our society. People would be a lot less likely to get into fights on a Saturday night as they would be ""chilled out"". I am a cannabis smoker and I am pushed into contact with criminals due to its prohibition. I am not a criminal in any other aspect I just like to smoke dope. I am a decent responsible person, just like thousands of other pot smokers.      The ""weed"" did wonders for the likes of Peter Tosh and Bob Marley. May be it can do wonders to other people also. So, legalise it!      Why pretend that cannabis is illegal for any other reason than economics? Cannabis makes big money. The alcohol and nicotine ""cartels"" already sell us the legal drugs, which cause more harm than cannabis in terms of health, violence and days off sick. The only hold up on legalisation is surely allowing for the proper marketing of cannabis by the over ground drug barons, rather than the ""underground"". Any government worth its salt would be already making deals with the big boys, it makes economic sense to do so, so we must assume some of the these big ""legal"" dealers are already embarking in the back room deals which will ultimately lead to the supply shifting from ""under"" to ""over ground"". In the meantime, about 80%+ of us have to remain criminals whilst the fat cats get ready to cream off the profits.      A Tory politician bringing this into debate is quite astounding - and impressive. The automatic ""No debate"" response is a reflection of the lack of open politics this country suffers from and why so many people did not vote in the election. As to some of the entries here, with things such as cannabis is worse than alcohol effects, shows that like many of the people administering the prohibition, the people making entries have no knowledge of the subject or experience of users. I do not smoke dope at present but appreciate its better effects than drink in terms of violence and character change.      I agree that cannabis should be decriminalised. By doing this, police time is freed up for more important things. This does not mean that cannabis is a safe drug, however. From my own experience, long-term cannabis smokers tend to lose the drive to achieve, suffer from cognition problems and will probably be a considerable burden on society when they reach old age. Visit Christiania in Denmark to see the long-term effects of daily cannabis use: It's not pretty. But, it's a question of moderation, isn't it? What gets me is the government's disingenuity about the issue... I can't imagine the current pilot project in the Met police area going ahead without Whitehall's blessing. Furthermore, Radio 4 is increasingly carrying content which is cannabis-friendly. I think public opinion is being prepared for decriminalisation within this parliament. After all, it's hard to riot when you're stoned, unless you have a full supply of chocolate bars.      As usual, the pro-cannabis lobby always think of their selfish needs. The countries that produce the crop, are probably the poorest in the world. ""Liberation Armies"" or mafia gangs control the taxation and production. These countries already owe billions to the World Bank, because so much land is turned over to the production of drugs, and food production gets left behind. Every time you take a drag on your spliff, have a thought for the producers, who get none of the profit, but get all the misery. Decriminalising drugs would simply encourage farmers and others in third world countries to give in to the drug barons, and cultivate the plants. Making the production like a cash crop, will not solve their problems either.      Cannabis consumption DOES lead to hard drug use. I chose to use cannabis from my own free will about 10 years ago. Since that time I have dabbled in other drugs like amphetamines, Ecstasy, etc, etc. Why did I do that? Simple, they were being sold by the same people who sold me cannabis. Break the link and bingo, lower hard drug use. Now ordinarily I don't agree with Tory policies but...      Up until November 2000 I was on 10/18 df118's + 8/12 paracetemol and anti-depressants for severe pain and discomfort(DAILY). I am now using cannabis (weed) and no longer use any tablets. I have no side effects and live as normal a life as possible. The reason some people move on to harder drugs is they have to go to the illegal dealer where more often than not other drugs are on offer. It makes sense to me to take the hard drugs out of the equation. You need somewhere to purchase cannabis totally free from temptation and peer pressure.      Think of countries like Saudi Arabia, where people would be horrified to consider allowing off-licences to be built to sell alcohol to over 18s, but what is out attitude in the UK towards alcohol? Some countries may be horrified at the thought of their populations becoming alcoholic, like the UK, but we live quiet happily with it and society accepts it here, so why does the government worry about us becoming a ""mildly druggie nation"" if cannabis was legalised? If anyone really wants to use cannabis, they can get it now quite easily, so why not simply let the individual person be credited with the intelligence to choose for themselves and let the state benefit from the taxation benefits, rather than the drug dealers?      Yes. People use it. And have always used it. Why does it still have to be severely punished all around the world?      Britain is proud of its reputation of tolerance. 30 years ago, homosexuality was illegal, and the same arguments were used to keep it illegal - since homosexuality is illegal then all homosexuals are by definition criminals. The same applies to cannabis - while it is illegal then users are forced to associate themselves with criminals. The real reason that it will not be legalised in this country is that the brewers pay the politicians vast sums to keep it illegal, because they realise that if cannabis were legal then people would prefer it to alcohol.      In 1983 I was arrested by two plain-clothes policemen in the street in Brixton and charged with possession of 1.04 grams of cannabis. I was fined 30 pounds when I appeared at the magistrates court. Since I consider the law against cannabis ""petty, archaic and misguided"", I refused to pay the fine. I was given a week in Pentonville Prison as a reward for my protest. That happened in the Nanny State of Britain 20 years ago, and yet that ""archaic"" law I objected to still applies. If the Conservatives had put the legalization of cannabis on their list of promises during the last election, Tony Blair would have had a serious challenge to his leadership. As it is, ""Cool Britannia"" is just a sham.      If only the Tories had tried the tolerant stance pre-election I'd have voted for them. Politicians have enough to do trying to run the country - they should leave running my life to me. I enjoy pot, I avoid tobacco - my choice based on facts rather than hype. It should be legal for all adults and sold in coffee-shop-type outlets like in Holland. Maybe there will be a few more mellow people around at first but this is a Good Thing. I mean, there's nothing actually wrong with giggling, talking about God and asking your friends to ""write this down, it's soooo deep!"" If we had a real debate over this with real facts, cannabis would be seen as the marvellous plant it is. And yes, I ""am"" a musician.      I strongly believe that cannabis should be legalised. At the moment for cannabis users the biggest risk is the possibility of getting a criminal record, not a health risk! But apart from that I think that legalisation would also lead to a change in attitude to the other benefits of cannabis- it is easy to grow and has many uses- as a replaceable source of fuel for the future when our natural fossil fuels run out, fabric- apparently to use hemp instead of cotton most fabric manufacturers would have to make small changes to the machinery, also detergents and plastic products. It is a shame that such a raw material has been virtually ignored due to its druggy connotations, and propaganda generated by the oil producers.      I have smoked cannabis since 1976 and since then I have met people from ALL walks of life around at the dealers house. I'd bet some of the high profile people who are opposed to cannabis would faint if they knew who some of them are! Believe me or not the FACT is that they span the entire social and employment spectrum. The most pleasing thing I've noticed over the years is that when we're all sat around the table enjoying a smoke we all seem to have an equality and an ability to laugh with each other. To this date I have never seen a fight between any of these so-called criminals and I do wish I could say the same for people I have seen drinking alcohol together. LEGALISE CANNABIS NOW YOU HYPOCRITICAL PEOPLE!      Cannabis is dangerous, it does cause medical problems, cancer, hallucinations - therefore the position has not changed, the prime minister's official spokesman said on Friday. Well I'm afraid beer causes liver damage, stupidity and violent behaviour. And for cigarettes... well read the side of the pack, so why does the government not want cannabis legalised??? As for the argument for cannabis leading to hard drugs, I say this: The first time most people smoke cannabis is at a party after consuming alcohol. Makes you think that alcohol is truly the stepping stone to other ""drugs"", but it's O.K. because alcohol is a socially acceptable drug like cigarettes.      Of course it should. The whole concept of prohibition of drugs needs to be reassessed. It doesn't work, it never can work and there is no reason to believe it is desirable. Those who argue against this simply do not understand how prevalent drug use is. For those born today, drug use as a means of recreation will be absolutely the acceptable norm - regardless of upbringing, class, morality etc. The sooner we adapt our attitudes to this, the better able society will be to integrate drug use in a sensible, safe, productive and practical way.      The argument that cannabis should not be legalised because it leads to harder drugs is fallacious. The reason cannabis leads to harder drugs is because it is not legalised and so many users assume that other illegal drugs are also innocuous. Make cannabis legal and you are creating a creating a much clearer distinction.      Whatever problems are caused by unregulated access to drugs pale into insignificance when compared with the problems caused by banning them. The people with most to gain from anti-drug laws are the organised criminals and those with most to lose are the innocent victims of drug-addicts forced into crime to feed their habit. Human societies have always used drugs for ""recreational"" and ritualistic purposes and this will not be stopped by legislation. Let's abandon all anti-drug legislation now and give people the right to take responsibility for their own actions.      I do not think that drugs should be legalised, but if you are in possession of them you should not be classed a criminal or sent to prison. For addiction with the harder type drugs you could be offered rehabilitation, because I am sure that people like to take drugs but not be addicted to them. I don't accept that mind and behaviour altering substances should be seen as acceptable in our society today - whilst the adverse physical affects may be limited, the mental effects of drug use over a prolonged period are definitely bad for individuals and societies. How can we achieve a solution, giving free will to individuals without ruining our social fabric for future generations? I don't know - decriminalise yes, legalise no.      If it were useful as a medicine, I would say yes. But just a doctor should decide in which case cannabis should be taken. But for public use, I definitely say NO! It is more than disgusting when someone is smoking a joint next to you. And by the way, the smoke is disturbing for non-smoking people. A pint hasn't that effect. To legalise cannabis and open it for the public, so that everyone could buy it, means a step backward in development. Cannabis smoking people are always comparing it with drinking alcohol. But there's a big difference between smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol. People who smoke cannabis are just doing it to get stoned. But drinking a pint is just for getting rid of thirst.      Yes, I think it's high time it should be legalised. In fact I predict it probably will be legal in a few years' time anyway, or at least available from licensed hash bars in places like Soho or Brixton. Incidentally, I'm surprised that the percentage of 16-29 year olds quoted is that low. If you've been to university, you've almost certainly come into contact with it, and most people will probably recall seeing it at parties when they were still at school. There are downsides to using ""the weed"" just like there are with excessive boozing, but in all honesty I can't see any overriding reasons for booze to be legal and cannabis to be illegal. Hard drugs, though, that's a different matter.      Cigarettes now hold public health warnings, people are already unbelievably suing tobacco companies - why? Smokers take up hospital beds, they waste our GPs' time and they don't mind inflicting smoke on other people then disposing of fag ends recklessly. Do we really need to go through it all again with another self-induced drug? Leave the drugs to the medical profession.      I don't want to see cannabis legalised at all. I've seen people whose personalities have been altered after smoking it and the effects are worse than alcohol. Smoke this, get behind the wheel of a car and drive under its effects and the consequences are barely worth thinking about, especially if a young child or other drivers are victims.      I agree with Phil, UK. I am not a conservative but if the Tories were the only party standing on a legalise policy I would vote for them.      If cannabis was legalised would the ""packet"" come with a government health warning?      This is a really difficult subject. On the one hand, cannabis has proved to be useful in treating pain for MS sufferers, for example. On the other hand, there are always going to be stupid people who misuse the drug, and in the wrong hands it can lead to more serious drug abuse. But then also if it was legalised, maybe people would have a more sensible attitude towards it!      I agree, let's stop wasting police time and legalise and tax the use of cannabis. Personally I wouldn't use it as long-term use has been linked to memory loss, paranoia and certain studies have found it to be more carcinogenic than tobacco.      Why not legalise the stuff? A startling percentage of the voters of this country smoke it - should we not at least have the democratic right to put the issue to referendum? I will continue using it regardless of legal status but I would feel happier if it was legalised. "
HOC HOC-IL -0.05 " We have a pretty good man doing a generally good job. Many who begrudge him a level of pay commensurate with his status (assessed not by him but independently) don't flinch at the levels of pay of footballers, media stars and others doing far less onerous jobs. We have become such a whining, whingeing nation.      Why should we struggle to make a living with a measly pay increase of around 3.5% when people like him can give themselves a 40% increase?; when tax increases and tax on tax kills our income before we have even managed to pay our bills? It's young people like myself that are looking to buy property and they are pushing our resources to the limit before we start.      He still gets much less than many company directors and was voted back in with a large majority so it was probably the best time for him to catch up.      Government ministers should have an element of their pay performance linked, depending on how much they deliver. The public could vote electronically at the end of each term to determine the level of bonus for each minister from a range of options. After all, we are their employers, aren't we?      I still don't understand how a man can justify awarding himself a 40% pay rise when he is already on a huge salary, the like of which those of us in the public sector will never see, especially with a 3% annual pay rise.      Many older people who are trying to survive on a fixed income have been hit very hard by tax rises in the last 4 years. Blair's huge pay rise merely adds insult to injury.      It's not a matter of whether he deserves the pay rise, its the moral precedent. Politics must not be a profitable enterprise, it should be based on the desire to change society for the better. I think Mr Blair should look at his underlying reasons for wanting to become Prime Minister. To earn such a considerable amount of money diminishes the post and would encourage corrupt politicians.      Mr Blair runs the country. How does his salary compare to newsreaders and breakfast TV presenters I wonder?      Many people have commented that Tony Blair's salary is low compared to some company bosses. Very true, however any company boss who had presided over the Dome, Wembley and London Underground fiascos (to name but three) would have been out of a job a long time ago.      I have no problem with someone drawing their full pay. Comparing the worth of the job, to other fields is very difficult to determine. What I would like to see here in the USA, would be a constitutional amendment that basically would state that no government officials could give themselves a pay raise, specifically, that only the people (whole nation) would have to approve any and all pay raises and other perks of the job. Especially for the upper echelons of government.      The point is not that MPs and Ministers require high salaries in order to attract talented people (anyone recall the notion of public service), it is that to hike the salaries immediately after an election campaign that included no mention of pay rises for Ministers is an example of breath-taking arrogance and a disgraceful disregard for honesty and clarity.      Certainly the UK prime minister's salary is well below those of his European counterparts, and it doesn't strike me as extravagant considering the importance of the job. But whenever I think about Tony Blair and his pay rise, the Millennium Dome looms up on the horizon. That catastrophe, very much of Blair's making, cost my country untold millions of pounds and he should not be allowed to forget it.      Instead of comparing Tony Blair to heads of large corporations let's compare him to other people in the public sector, nurses, teachers, civil servants, even doctors. Most have had to settle for somewhere between 3% and 5% and even if the PM has had a pay freeze for the last four years it still equates to over 10% a year, when was the last time staff in the public sector were given this as a rise?      I am no fan of Tony Blair, but I think people ought to realise that he is actually very good value for money. Think about how tough being PM must be - 24hour media attention, very little free time, threat of terrorism, strain on family life - can anyone therefore think that it's unreasonable to pay him annually what some sportsmen earn in a fortnight?      All he is doing is taking the salary he was entitled to take since 1997. Tony Blair and the Cabinet denied themselves their full share for four years, and by all accounts saved between 2-3 million of taxpayers money. Now they've decided to take the salary that they are allowed and that John Major and Maggie Thatcher drew in full from day one. In short, there are hypocrites in this debate but they are not in the Cabinet.      How else is he to pay the transport costs to send his kids to school outside of his local education authority?      If I smile a lot, spout a lot of waffle and break all my promises can I get #150,000 or more courtesy of the taxpayer?      Does he pay his 40% tax on this? Does his wife pay her tax? Or are they both exempt? This is the main issue here as Blair has raised taxes so much since coming to power.....      In my view Tony Blair should practice what he preaches. He wants everyone in the UK to work for the minimum wage but not him or his Cabinet. That is just typical of this Government. Mr Blair probably has more 'benefits in kind' than any other employee in the UK. Therefore, based on that I wonder what Mr Blair's 'real' salary is......unless of course he doesn't have to declare 10 Downing Street and his cars as benefit in kind.      This whole attack has been staged by spiteful Tory die-hards who aren't gentlemen enough to accept defeat. Mr Hague would have had the same salary, had the people been stupid enough to vote him in, and nobody would have protested. The only hypocrisy is theirs. The plan is to fan the flames of discontent among the underpaid, as if all these teachers and trainee nurses would benefit if the PM decided not to get his entire salary. Most of them should stop and think who got them into this position in the first place.      Politicians knew the terms and conditions of their employment well before they were elected and to vote themselves massive increases when they are paid well over the national average wage already is simply hypocritical. At the end of a successful political career they are well rewarded with peerages, book deals and a place on the after dinner circuit. You don't see many teachers or nurses or other underpaid hard working employees in the private and public sector spending their twilight years in this lucrative pursuit. Someone needs to let these people know what it's like out here in the REAL world.      Like most public servants, the value of their salary has been slipping over the past decade. As a result the talented people are not attracted to the public service. It has been the same with politicians. The gaps are filled by large numbers of untalented people - witness the current government. Stop messing around and double their salaries.      What's wrong with increasing your salary by 40%? Maybe he did it because he couldn't stand the fact that his wife gets paid more, maybe his election campaign cost him out of his pocket or maybe he needs a bit of motivation to keep on doing his job. I sure wish I could increase MY salary like that!      Those who think that what Tony Blair gets by way of salary is excessive should see how much the PM and the cabinet in Singapore get by way of salary (about US$1,2 million for the PM and about US$600,000 for a Cabinet Minister)! Yes, more than the President of the US or PM of the UK! The argument is that it takes the best to run this tiny state with US$140 billion in reserves and therefore you need to pay for the best!      The President of United States makes about E290,000. The Prime Minister of Britain makes about E160,000. That's a big difference in money. I don't understand why people are making a big deal about it. People in United States don't care how much the President makes. We have better things to debate about rather than debate about the salary of the President or Prime Minister.      Yes he deserves to be paid, but the rise in pay is obscene.      Tony Blair could easily earn double his PM salary as a lawyer. He chooses to serve his country instead. He's worth every penny he's paid. The whingers about his salary are probably the same people who want a first class health service, railway system etc but don't want to pay extra taxes. If we want quality, we have got to pay for it.      How many other people would defer taking full pay for as long as these ministers already have? Would You? I think not. The pay was deemed fair by an independent body - if we didn't think the findings correct this debate should have happened a long time ago. Move on, people. Focus on the real issues instead of falling for red herrings such as these. It's a dead subject. Don't kid yourself that this money would cover better pensions or public service. That's a bigger issue and one worth the trouble of your energy. I hope you are all as vigorous in the campaign to improve pensions and public services.      While I don't have a problem with pay rises for Mr. Blair, 40% is far too much, particularly in comparison to the 3% expected for backbench MPs. He gets #47,000 extra a year to #163,000. Lots of people don't get this much over five years and any increase they get in wages is dictated only by rises in the minimum wage and the discretion of the companies in question.      The Prime Minister and ministers choose their vocation. Teachers choose their vocation. Neither vocation can be equated to industry but a significant difference between the two vocations is that the teachers cannot increase their salary at will or use their position as a springboard to much higher paid jobs. I find arguments that equate the Prime Minister's job with that of his industry counterparts spurious. The Prime Minister has made a mistake in increasing his salary just after winning an election. His increase serves to compound the lack of morale in so many other ""vocational"" professions!      Oh for goodness sake! I voted Conservative but at least I can see the efforts he has made in refusing a pay rise until now. Give the guy a break. His family is slaughtered in the press and his personal life is always under the spotlight. He deserves the money. (The same amount that Mr Beckham earns in TWO WEEKS!)      Our business went bust because of foot-and-mouth and the collapse in tourism. I'm lucky to earn #100pw at the moment. As if between him and his wife they really needed it. What a greedy, insensitive thing to do. He has shown himself in his true colours, and the people who put him there should be ashamed of themselves. I won't forget come next election.     Ladies and Gents. Remember this pay increase as the public sector pay awards come around as you're likely to receive 4% not 40%. If you want 10% then you're going to have to fight for it. The Labour Government had no policies for increased pay awards in its manifesto, so please ask Mr Blair how he expects to encourage more new nurses, teachers and police when the salaries are so low. My only thoughts are, the Government looks after themselves but who will look after you?      I don't begrudge awarding a performance related pay increase for any suitable candidate, whatever walk of life he may come from, but what puzzles me is just how Tony Blair has demonstrated to us that he is worthy of this pay rise? Could it be with the thousands of farmers who have had their livelihoods wiped out by government mismanagement? Or the hundreds of ordinary families who struggle to make ends meet in ""rip off"" Britain. Maybe it's by fleecing the innocent motorist every time he fills up his tank? Sorry Tony, but I for one don't think you deserve it and just for the record, THANKS for rubbing our noses in it. Besides that.. ask yourself how a TRUE leader would reward himself by being allowed to lead the nation.      The pay he gets is relatively low - a chief executive of a local authority is normally on more than #100K for managing a tiny part of the country. However, I would like to see some element of performance related pay as an incentive to deliver what has been promised in the election.      Tony Blair works for the public. We pay his salary. We also paid for his very expensive advertising during the election. And as you can see from this Talking Point - the public is not happy. Why the British public didn't vote against Labour is beyond me. Why the vast majority which gave the signal that all his failings were ""fine""? You voted for him, now live with his mediocrity.      The timing may be inappropriate and perhaps the increase should have been brought in gradually over a number of years. Having said this however, the PM is still paid a lot less than company directors whilst having much more responsibility      Why should the Cabinet get paid what they deserve? Everyone else in the country gets paid as little as their employers can get away with. The recent election shows that if we sack an MP there are ten equally qualified people queuing up to do the job. In any other profession they'd get less than #15,000 regardless of qualifications. If he was willing to do the job for #100,000 why should he get more?      Tony Blair is the PM of the 4th largest economy in the world. Considering we pay Ken Barlow from Coronation Street #160,000, whose job is more important??      He does deserve his salary - no question. But since when does everyone in the UK get the salary they deserve? As an already wealthy public sector figure, he should be last in line to get what he deserves, behind all the teachers and nurses and other under-paid public sector workers who are doing vital work and struggling to get by.      Huffing and puffing about the salaries of Cabinet Ministers is just as daft as the moaning and groaning that goes on whenever we hear that the PM and his family are using the Royal flight to go on holiday. Believe me, you would NOT want those people on your charter flight to Milan - departure would be delayed by hours to allow for the sniffer dogs, security checks and so on. Far better that we should concentrate our energies on making sure Ministers are doing their jobs properly and delivering on their promises than whinging about what they're paid.      I suggest his salary be performance related. Voluntary workers would earn more!      People don't seem to realise how hard the Prime Minister actually has to work, the length of the hours, and the incredible responsibility he has. Every single decision he makes is important, and he definitely deserves every penny he gets.      Hands up anyone who thinks his job is easy. I didn't vote for Tony Blair, because I wanted someone else to do the job. That doesn't mean I don't think he should be paid appropriately. He is entitled to his pay - so give it to him and don't be petty.      My God, the UK has just discovered that Blair is a politician after all.      They'll have fun negotiating public sector pay rises this year      It seems to be a favourite ploy of politicians, this side of the Atlantic and there, to give themselves hefty raises in their first months into office, (so that by the end of their term, the constituents will have had plenty of time to forget it) but Blair has to beat the record for not wasting time! The Canadian Prime Minister John Chretian at least waited 6 months before giving himself a 40 per cent pension increase and 22 per cent rise in pay, whilst civil servants are having a hard time trying to get a measly two per cent rise! Does Blair deserve it? Of course not! He hasn't even started work yet! It's incredible, the amount of gall these politicians have and if I was a British taxpayer I would raise hell over this latest stab in the back!      For losing all trace of a private life, for exposing your family to the glare of publicity, for having to be on call twenty-four hours a day, for being responsible for a nation, for all that and MUCH more the salary is far too low. However, how about making it a bit more interesting? Why not pay half of that amount as a salary, and half as a bonus IF the general public are happy with the PM's performance in a given year? Difficult to judge accurately, but surely an incentive to please the majority of people in the UK and perhaps it may even see an end to the inevitable tax cuts granted just before an election (might get them every year!!). Then again, in our fickle world, who on earth would accept that challenge?      How many of us would take less than that on offer for *any* job? Get real. A PM and cabinet ministers deserve something for the hours of effort and activity. No one is criticising David Beckham or Sol Campbell for #120,000 A WEEK?!      Of course he deserves his pay - in fact its not a raise - the pay rates have been frozen for 4 years - lets give him credit for that. I didn't hear many of the unions saying they were going to follow his example and suggest a four year pay freeze for their members - so lets use equal standards before we judge.      We need the brightest, most talented people in politics. Tony Blair could earn far more in another job, but thankfully he's no purely motivated by money. We should pay our politicians a going rate for the job, which is more than Tony Blair currently earns by some margin.      Mr Blair claims to be a Christian Socialist! It seems more like champagne socialism to me with the emphasis on the champagne. How much more hypocrisy can the country bear from Mr Blair?      Tony Blair is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Tony Blair deliberately froze his own pay to set an example to public service workers - a move welcomed by them four years ago. Now the same group of people are using the media to criticise him for getting what reward he should have got in the first place. I am not saying that teachers and public service workers are also paid adequately, however it is unfair for them to draw a direct comparison with the Prime Minister's salary, and I don't want to hear this kind of unjustified moaning in the media.      US President George W. Bush is entitled to an annual salary of $400,000 (#290,000), which makes our Prime Minister, seem like good value! People should step back and look at what Tony Blair does for a living. Maybe then we can all get a sense of perspective.      Perhaps it's worth bearing in mind that Mr Blair isn't running the country single-handed. The hard work is done by a multitude of civil servants. He may take the credit (or the blame) but it is them who do the work and recommend the appropriate policies and decisions. What about paying them for running the country, rather than giving the 'figure-head' a large increase in his pocket money (after all the perks of the job mean he doesn't have to pay for housing, transport and probably many other items the civil servants need to cover).      Of course he has to raise his income. After he has put up taxes so much he needs the extra just to be where he was when he came in to office,      Before judging his decision, look at it this way - how many people would voluntarily NOT take the full pay offered when starting a new job. That's what he's done for the past 4 years. Give the guy a break - one of the hardest jobs in the world (i.e. pleasing the British public) deserves the remuneration.      Whether he deserves it will only come clear later. Should he be paid it? Sure. It's his salary, agreed by the independent advisory body, which he's denied himself for 4 years. In charge of a country, 24 hours a day, what should he receive? Congratulations? And as for the timing, when would be appropriate? At least he's proved himself over the last 4 years. And what about William Hague's salary as leader of the opposition: Doesn't look as if he deserves a penny of it!!      Tony Blair has broken another new record - the shortest honeymoon period in British political history ever! May I point out that he has no need whatsoever of his salary, considering that his wife alone earns #250,000 a year as a barrister! Margaret Thatcher did not need to draw her salary either, and went unpaid for 11 years. The privilege of the job itself should be its own reward. Explain this hypocrisy to trainee nurses working 60 hours a week for the minimum wage.      If Tony Blair was running any major UK company he'd be earning far more. So let him have his money, at the end of the day #163,000 only costs each of us 0.03pence per year. Get over it. And anyone who says that he shouldn't earn because Cherie already gets enough money, get real. Everyone has the right to earn from his/her job; lets see you work for free because the honour of doing your job is worth it alone.      If I was the PM, I wouldn't get out of bed for #163,000. There are people far less talented and qualified earning twice that and then some in the private sector. Good luck to him - and this is coming from a Tory voter.      I cannot see what the fuss is about. The PM has decided to accept the agreed rate for the job. He has not awarded himself an 'extra'. Rather than criticism he should get a bit of praise for refusing to take his increase for so long.      I think the PM's salary is well justified and it wouldn't matter what party the PM belonged to. The job is stressful enough and you also have to drag your family along with it. It is a well deserved pay rise.      Has he undermined the moral high ground his stance previously afforded him? Personally, I would say emphatically YES, because the public sector, to whom he was supposed to be setting such a shining example, have not received an equivalent rise over the past 4 years. So the example Blair set was one more of manipulation and expedience, rather than integrity. I am very disappointed, only five days after helping return them to power.      Although perhaps he could have picked a slightly better time to do this, it is justified. A) He hasn't been collecting the full salary up to now, so it isn't really a pay rise, more just getting what he's entitled too. B) For the job of running the UK you only get #163,000? I imagine being PM involved a little more stress than some of those big businesses with wages in the multi-millions for their directors.      #116,000 was probably underpaid for the top job, but then so are doctors and nurses underpaid. Let's give them 40% as well. This is disappointing for all those who voted for him, but unsurprising for all those who didn't. It's the dishonesty of the timing that depresses me the most.      If Mr Blair is going to increase his own and most, if not all other ministers' salaries by a reported 40% and then insist on pointing out the pay freeze he has imposed since 1997, isn't such a fact rather meaningless given that most British citizens would not have had more than a 15% increase in the same time? This is typical of the Labour government in that they manage to defend the negative points with ""red herring"" positive ones. An even sadder fact in my mind is that most of Britain accepts such comments as valid responses.      Good quality people should get paid well. If you peg MP's salaries, you end up with either talentless people, or millionaires who don't need the money anyway.      Tony Blair is entitled to his pay rise, as are the cabinet ministers. The criticism he has received is unwarranted. He is merely reinstating a pay increase that he chose to forego during his last term in office. Plus, his new salary would appear meagre compared with what many investment bankers rake in on a regular basis. The way this issue has been covered in the press illustrates how the media is pandering to populist sentiments.      Somebody wake me up when this is over. All the old clich?s about ""underpaid compared to heads of business."" Then go into the private sector and leave the job of Prime Minister to someone who will make a real difference to people's lives. The opposition, unions, teachers and nurses are up in arms - well what are they supposed to say? Congratulations? Do they expect Blair to lose any sleep over an issue that will be forgotten as soon as the next fat cat awards himself a huge salary increase, together with preferential share options on the back of making hundreds of staff redundant?      It is petty minded to say this is ""wrong"". Although a dyed in the wool Tory myself, the fact of the matter is that we lost and Mr. Blair is now our Prime Minister! As such, he deserves to be compensated appropriately.      Maybe he is worth that amount of money for a very stressful and demanding job, but its just typical in a week when I learn I'm not getting any pay rise this year.      Of course he deserves this sort of salary. It's not the personality but the position he holds which is important. For the level of responsibility he holds you could argue he is underpaid. Oh, I'm also a Conservative voter!      Maybe now there might be some incentive to get some real talent into the government.      What a shame; I thought I had voted for a Prime Minister that was going to be more radical! The timing and the percentage rise are of course beyond words. And the implication is that now his job is safe for four years he's awarded himself a juicy #200,000 bonus. The Prime Minister of the people? I don't think so!      What does Paxman earn? What does the BBC Director-General get in bonus alone? It's time to grow up and recognise - if you pay peanuts you get monkeys. Let's pay the rate for the job.      This is yet another example of the current government's self-absorption and indifference to the electorate. Blair knew full well that if he had so much as mentioned this in a manifesto, many voters would have felt obliged to register the discontent. So what does he do? He casually forgets to mention that while 'stringent spending plans are needed for other public services, front bench politicians can decide when and how much more money they pay themselves. This is the government we have voted for. A dishonest, deliberately misleading bunch of careerist sycophants and unprincipled megalomaniacs who do not have the interests of those that vote for them at the heart of their politics.      Let's not forget that the 'independent body' which recommended the pay rise for our magnificent MPs was very similar to the one which was scrapped by the Government a few years ago for suggesting that public sector workers (at the sharp end of course) were underpaid. The hypocrisy of Government never ceases to amaze me.      The timing of the pay award couldn't have been worse, following a worryingly low turnout at the election signalling public apathy and disillusionment. People feel increasingly alienated from politics and this gives them yet another reason to abstain at the ballot box, perhaps with good reason.      Whether his new salary is 'too much' according to people's opinion is a red herring. He is accepting the salary that comes with the job, just as it did with Major or Thatcher. That, for the last five years he has refused to take all of that salary is something to be praised. On the other hand, quite why he now decides on the full amount is anyone's guess, and while not morally wrong, it is really bad PR.      He is entitled to the pay increase. After all it is what he is entitled to and is only such a large increase because he chose to earn much less in the previous Parliament. How many people would work for a lower salary than their job entitled them to.      This man runs the country. He makes decisions that affect millions of lives and he is ultimately responsible. The buck stops with him. I would not be willing to do his job for only #163,000.      There are a hell of a lot of other people getting paid an awful lot more to do far less stressful, and far less worthy jobs. I think the people that run the country should be paid in line with those that drive the wheels of industry. How else are we going to attract get the best candidates for the job.      First fat cats of industry now fat cats of Government.      He is paid too much. Teachers and other public sector workers have appalling pay and conditions, the money should go to them.      Just think for an extra #50,000 a year we could have got Rory Bremner. Not only would he have been a better Tony Blair than Tony himself, but he would have been the entire Labour cabinet and opposition for no additional cost. Missed a bargain there I think.      Mr Blair's new salary is basically minuscule compared to those of top industrial managers. Good prime ministers tend to deserve a good remuneration and unpopular prime ministers don't! Personally, a man who can diminish the Tories into a spent unelectable force deserves every penny he gets!      Ministerial pay has not been frozen for the last four years: it has risen in line with inflation. People criticise business leaders' pay, but at least they have to earn it, through selling more, or better products. The Government merely has to collect more taxes. In this, they have been very successful.      I don't know what the fuss is all about - Blair must be the lowest paid Head of State in the First World even with the reinstatement of his full pay. Even our Junior Ministers are paid far more than him and we don't complain, as you have to pay to get the right quality people to run the Government.      In my view the Prime Minister's salary even with the pay rise is almost insignificant for managing UK plc. Well deserved and easily justified. "
HOC HOC-IS -0.12 " People are only human and ALL human beings are prone to succumbing to temptation. How about installing a complex, moderated computer system to run governments around the world? You can't bribe a machine!      Transparency International has done an excellent job here in Slovakia in the past few years. It has made the issue of corruption a permanent topic of discussion, and a good number of public figures have had to leave their posts in disgrace, labelled as corrupt - while the TE's Slovak representative has been proclaimed the woman of the year! But there's still a long way to go, especially at lower levels - hospitals, school entry examinations, permits, etc. Such cases rarely hit the news...      As long as society is capital orientated, corruption is inevitable. We're living in a society where everyone wants to amass as much wealth as he/ she can. Someone wants to be a millionaire, and a millionaire wants to be a billionaire. So some will try dubious means to get to the top quicker.      Everywhere you go you see corruption. I've just come back from Syria and couldn't believe what I saw - you have to pay for everything there. At the airport I even had to pay for my passport so that I could get it earlier than other people.      In my country corruption used to be common practice everywhere from a higher level to the lower grass roots. It was becoming part of our traditional cultural values and it was feared that it might not be controlled by the government of Pakistan. Now things have changed a bit under the military regime. But it is still a far-fetched idea to say that corruption can be removed from the world. It's like a contagious disease which has infected the whole structure of government.      Corruption is inevitable, but certain circumstances can increase it to grotesque proportions. Here elected parliamentary members are expected to be board members of various businesses as their only source of income. This region also has very low tax rates which have combined to make corruption such a way of life in providing a high and regular source of revenue that it seems to be no longer noticed. For many, therefore, it ceases to be a problem of conscience.      I'm from Ecuador in South America where corruption is just part of our lives. Two years ago I got my ID and driver's licence stolen from my car. The right thing to do was to go and apply for them again. But it was a process that could take too long, so I did what everybody else does, I paid someone to get the documents for me.      Should we leave behind or give tips when a service is rendered? Should we give presents on birthdays or during festive seasons? If 'yes' to all of the above, are we not practising and encouraging a kind of corruption?      Your comments before we went ON AIR      The only way to minimise graft is to limit politicians to a fixed term in office. There are so many professional politicians, particularly in the US. For example, former President Clinton has never worked in the private sector!      Because corruption exists, does not mean to say it's right. It's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold. If Finland can uphold such high standards, and still do well, why can't others?      Having had the ""good fortune"" of attending a private school in one of the most highly corrupt countries in the world (Bangladesh), I was able to see corruption in action from very close quarters. I was surrounded by the sons and daughters of the elite, most of whom have amassed their enormous fortunes, courtesy of rampant corruption.      What is corruption? Accepting an expensive pair of shoes for turning a blind eye to the activities of a friendly company is. But surely, so is accepting campaign funds from big corporations and then reneging on global environmental treaties? It's just that little bit harder to be caught red-handed.      Rule No.1: Corruption is an ordinary crime! Rule No.2: There are no inevitable crimes! Personally I'm very glad to watch the news nowadays which clearly show that no politician, neither in the Far East nor in the ""civilized"" West can feel safe when taking bribes. No matter how powerful he is...or used to be. Mr. Kohl and Mr. Dumas...      Is there any country in this world that is not corrupt? Corruption exists because there is a giver and a taker. The giver corrupts because he wants the rules to be bent so that he can make a quick profit. The taker need corrupt money to satisfy his. As long as there is greed in a society there will be corruption. One might say India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Philippines are the most corrupt of all nations in the world. I would include USA. The American President is elected through a complicated system that paves the way for business lobbies to fund parties for future favours. Just one example; no president would go against China trade in spite of human rights violations because of American investments in China. This is an example of indirect corruption.      As appeared on these web pages and in the Economist, the least corrupt nation in the world is Finland. As an Englishman living here for a few years now, I can understand why. The Finns are also the third most competitive nation in the world in terms of economic performance, government and business efficiency and infrastructure (Time May 7th from World Competitiveness Yearbook). This proves that it can pay not to be corrupt and still be very effective in business.      In one country it is called fund-raising (forgetting about following decisions, the administration makes in favour of the donors), and in some other country it is straight pay-upfront-and-get what you want. Whether we accept it or not, it is everywhere. However we should also accept that not all are corrupt. I had a chance to act corrupt in my career with government, but never succumbed to it.      It takes a strong character to withstand temptation in high places...      Bribery, corruption, embezzlement has always been with us - its human nature. I think the 95% of people, given the opportunity, would accept a bribe - if they thought that no one would know.      Accepting that corruption is widespread, albeit a lot less obvious in first world countries than in developing or third world countries, the problem is that those who see it and report it are the losers. How can this be changed? How can the ""whistle blower"" be supported and upheld?      It is all very well for the protesters in America and Europe to call for forgiveness of debt to Third World countries, saying that debt is keeping them in poverty. In reality corruption in government is what is bringing these countries to their knees. To say it is inevitable is to condone it.      In Scotland, parliament voted on some legislation to compensate fishermen, only for the executive to overturn the democratic will of the people because it didn't suit them. If that was done in a country like Iraq it would be considered the height of corruption, yet in voting-apathetic Britain this is accepted without fuss. That's democracy for you: politicians are allowed to be corrupt, but only with the tacit consent of the people.      I thought the whole reason that bureaucracies were invented wasn't to eliminate corruption, but to minimize corruption by compartmentalizing and limiting the damage that anyone person can do. But methinks the paradigm has changed in the age of automation, as now a single person in the right spot with the inclination and skill can wreak havoc.      I guess the comment about ""Power corrupts"" comes to peoples mind, but I don't take that negative view. It assumes that everybody is corruptible, it assumes the concept of original sin to be true.      I think it is more accurate to say: ""Power attracts the corruptible"". There can be honesty in politics/business/etc, but we are force-fed a diet of movies and media that tell us that everyone has skeletons in their closet. The majority no longer look for, hope for nor expect honesty, and the expectation breeds the result.      Power simply corrupts, and that is why we should simply not trust people with power, be it a politician or the saint next door!      The issue of corruption will never go away until we reach the Utopia, where everybody's dreams of a better life have been fulfilled. As long as poverty, class, hegemony of control, etc exist there will be corruption. ""What is in it for me?"", as I call it here in Kenya, will continue to bring down politicians, and other people of power. In West Africa the Ibos say ""He who brings kola brings life"", I think this is corruption in the essence of the struggle to excel, in today's rat-race job market and super profit goals.      Where there is power there is corruption, always has been always will be...      Lets face it, most of us would like a good salary hike. What happens if you refuse? Thankfully as a laboratory worker I'm not in a ""bribeable"" situation. It does seem to be part of business culture in some far eastern countries though. Sad. It's surprising it's not more widespread.      In my country we had so much corruption. We were in major debt with our allies and our financial connections for example with the World Funds. We were in so much trouble when Nawaz Sharif was in power...he was found to have taken most of the money and saved it for himself. Our military decided enough is enough and ousted the money hungry PM out of office. This year I came back to see the country I had once left and saw a major positive change. There are more jobs, less poverty, more water, more food, more security and the list goes on. It is good to have an uncorrupt regime. So whatever the world says about us getting back to democracy, they should first see what kind of corruption they have in their government.      Corruption is part of us. We all want to hook some up or if we want something done and we know someone, we consider it easily done. It is ingrained in our speech when we say that we know the right people or ""we have the right contacts"". These right contacts may have to bend a little too, in order to accommodate our requests. Basically when one person causes the other to be corrupt, none of them is less guilty than the other. But as long as our mentality remains like this, we are destined to be a corrupt race, some more than others.      Due to human nature it is inevitable, but can be minimised within a properly designed and maintained regime - in the same way as most of us don't burgle our neighbours' houses. However, it is far more likely now since the last Tory government replaced the notion of Public Service with that of Authority Without Responsibility.      I could not agree more that corruption is an inevitable phenomenon in the global community. I strongly believe that the practice, though relative to locations, is an endemic component of our economic fabric. This tends to be true whether it's a market economy, socialist and/ or traditional systems. The difference being on how it is regulated and to what extent it is tolerated by societies. I think no one could cite a corruption free country/ system or disprove it otherwise.      A certain amount is inevitable. Certainly reliance on economic systems with little or no competition for services, where success is determined by who one knows is more than what one knows, virtually guarantees a higher level of corruption. This is obviously true for more strongly socialist systems because one party (the government) provides so many of life's services or make all of the decisions and they are a monopoly.      Power breeds corruption. The more power a person has, the more corrupt they tend to be. It's a simple truth. Very few people have the personal self-control required to prevent them from abusing the system. Then, once the first abuse has occurred, which may be very minor, more and worse abuses come easier and easier. You can see it everywhere. In business, if a director gets caught committing some serious offence, they normally take early retirement or just leave. They don't normally get prosecuted or sacked. Politicians are very similar. Corruption almost goes with the job. There are also different types of corruption. Is claiming benefits you are technically allowed, but morally shouldn't corruption? Is claiming for 1st class air fares and actually travelling by train corruption (EU MEPS)?      Corruption is only inevitable if your organisation has poor systems of control, lazy management and an ethos of corruption. Something that cannot be said about our much maligned public services. Our civil service as an example is probably one of the finest in the world well controlled and full of people with a genuine public servant spirit. How easily such ideals are lost if they are not nurtured.      Unfortunately this seems to be the way of things these days. There is such a focus in society on being rich that greed has taken over. People are susceptible to money, at the end of the day, we all need it, but we cannot stop at what we need, we have to have more. To get to the position of importance, unfortunately it may be necessary to get there by not strictly legitimate means, as if you don't act underhandedly, someone else will. Unfortunately the good guys rarely win these days.      Yes, in any organization where power and money flow freely corruption is going to and does happen. However we must remember that a lot of our politicians become civil servants out of a feeling of duty and a bond with their fellow citizens. Many truly want to serve their neighbours and do whatever they can to make sure their concerns are voiced. It is sad a few bad apples ruin the perception of our elected officials.      I think that it is not wise to generalise corruption as inevitable. Rather I think the primary cause for corruption in the modern world is due to its current emphasis on the automatic acceptance of any profit, sustained growth forever, more comfort at the expense of anything and the growth of multi-national organisations even if they do not care a mote about the well-being of its employees or the local inhabitants.      The issue of ""corruption"" is not very well defined; personally, I broadly translate the word as ""abuse of power"". In this case, corruption is everywhere. Businessmen earning half a million pounds a year surely do not do enough work to merit that amount of money! The only demarcation line between Estrada, Dumas and the boss of Railtrack is the issue of legality. Morally, however, these cases are the same.      As far as corruption in France is concerned, the sentence imposed on Mr Dumas is setting the ground for others. We've heard about the case of Roland Dumas unfolding for quite some time without really being able to predict when justice impose a sentence on him. It comes as a bit of blow. I think it does no harm to see the corruption issue being tackled in our country, although they are politicians for whom I have no more respect than Dumas, Mr Pasqua, Mr Tiberi on the right wing for instance. Even president Chirac is threatened. It seems that a taboo has fallen or rather is in the process of falling in France and that corruption is meant to be condemned.      Living as we humans do, bribery, corruption, or lobbying is our ancient method of bartering. What we need is to have a global governance representative of the people working at the grassroots level, so that no human is poor and no human is exceedingly rich, as wealth is measured where I live as your health. Oiling the wheel of the machine just means someone else gets crushed in the process. Working to one peaceful, loving end is the only way on a large scale.      Corruption is inevitable. Human nature makes it unavoidable.      The easiest way to stop petty corruption in society is to forget the concept that all services should be supplied equally to all people. This is a very hard step to take and to some extent undermines the equality of citizens in a society. But it is the correct step.     In this part of Switzerland people talk of ""copinage"" - a sort of ""it's who you know"". It is considered quite normal by respectable individuals to use links with people they know to get jobs, obtain favours or even avoid police punishment. Is this corruption?      In developing countries corruption is rife because wages are really low. It is accepted as part of life by the people and viewed merely as a means of oiling the machinery to get daily activities done smoothly without hassle. Corruption takes many forms and in developed countries it is camouflaged as lobbying. Multinational corporations pay for costly political campaigns and when their candidate wins it is pay back time. "
HOC HOC-JL -0.09 " The Kursk must be raised at least to make sure that future Russian generations will not have a burden of raising it. This time will come anyway, so better to do it now. The sailors must be properly buried - it is time to become more civilised.      The Kursk should be raised in order to discover the full circumstances to this disaster. I must however disagree as to raising it in order to recover the bodies. The sea is a very fitting place, as a grave, for a sailor.      Given it will only become more dangerous with time due to corrosion, I think there is a duty to remove this dangerous wreck from the sea (along with several others) as soon as possible. It should be done using the combined expertise of joint international effort.      I feel the submarine should be made safe by removing all of the radioactive material, but the men should stay buried at sea as befits naval personnel who die in service.      The Kursk should be raised if Russians want to keep their dignity and reputation. Those servicemen who died should be given patriotic burial by the Russians. These are men and women who died in the line of duty for the safety of the rest of Russia.      As an ex-submariner, I think the sea makes an appropriate burial location for seamen whose ships sink beneath them. If the concern is for the radioactivity in the reactor, then perhaps other nuclear submarines which have sunk, including the USS Threasher and USS Scorpion, should be considered.      Has anyone asked the kin of the victims? If it is their wish, raise the Kursk and do it now while the summer lasts.      Raising the Kursk may well be a costly and dangerous operation. The Kursk should be raised if only to secure the nuclear weapons on board and make sure the reactor core has not been damaged or exposed in any way. If left where she lies now, then the ecological consequences in years to come due to possible radioactive discharge into the sea will be catastrophic. It is time to put cost aside as a minor consideration and make sure we do the right thing.      Why do people feel that a sunken ship is so disrespectful as a final resting-place? It was good enough for Vikings, and burial at sea is a tradition amongst many naval forces. The only reason for disturbing the wreck is to prevent pollution, or to gain safety information which will prevent further tragedies. Dragging the bodies of professional sailors from the deep to bury on land is no sign of respect.      These experimental supersonic torpedoes are why there was an explosion. And they are also why Russia was so reluctant to accept salvage and rescue assistance. The technology used to be top secret, as it will completely alter submarine warfare. It will also defeat Bush's missile shield system. But it's no longer secret. You can read about it in 'Scientific American.'      If they raise the Kursk, what then? How will they dispose of the radioactive material? Simply raising it from the seabed is not enough... they need to have a long term plan for it. Plus the relatives need to have some physical, tangible monument to their lost men, somewhere to go and to mourn.      The brave sailors of the Kursk died in the performance of their duties. Burial at sea with your ship is not a dishonourable end for a naval sailor. Let them lie where they are.      If they don't raise it, they will have to commit to guarding the wreckage from foreign intelligence agencies forever. There's just too much to be learned from a modern Russian submarine in a few hundred feet of water. It has not been mentioned much in the media, but more than likely there are nuclear missiles on board with state-of-the-art guidance systems.      It is evident the Kursk should be raised. I have two reasons: 1 The nuclear stuff on board can destroy large parts of the sea forever (the former USSR and the US too are guilty in many other cases of the same and even larger danger.) 2 If the submarine is raised, it can be a symbol that shows not only the Russian people, but also the whole world, that such military material and messages are needless and a clear sign of the ultimate decadence of our highly technologised and industrialised world. Put that next to the fact that in 50 years we will succeed in destroying 50% of today's living species...)      As the wife of a serving submariner, this topic is uncomfortably close to home, and not an easy question to answer. The relevant authorities should work quickly to finally end the speculation about what will happen to the bodies of the submariners involved. The continuing media attention and uncertainty about what will happen is merely prolonging the agony of the families in Russia.      Russia should raise the Kursk for two reasons: 1) Eliminate the chance of a radioactive leakage that could be devastating for everybody 2) Give the Russian sailors back the dignity. However, I believe the operation should be carried out jointly by Russia and International authorities to avoid any further disasters.      The crewmembers of the Kursk were, like all other workers throughout the world, doing their best to perform their jobs properly and earn their wages accordingly. They didn't set out to be heroes and are the victims of just another workplace accident. Their bodies are therefore entitled to be returned to their families. Their employer should, like all other employers throughout the world, be obligated to spare no expense in doing so.      With its two 190MW reactors, the Kursk cannot stay at the seabed in one of the most important fishing areas in northern Europe. So far, no radioactive leakage is measured from the submarine. Considering lifting the Kursk we should hurry, but not rush. We can wait another year without risking radioactive leakages. Most likely, we cannot wait 10 years. Another important question to be answered is of course what to do with the submarine after it's lifted. The plan is to take it into the naval yard between Murmansk and Severomorsk. That does not solve the problem, only moves it. Therefore, the lifting plan should also involve a plan for a proper decommissioning of Kursk's two reactors.      It will be hard, risky, dangerous and expensive... But necessary! The sea isn't a trashcan!      It should be raised, preferably under international supervision, in order to recover the nuclear material and to establish once and for all the cause of the sinking so that it is not repeated, maybe in a less remote location. Lessons could also be learned which will improve the chances of rescuing sailors trapped in similar circumstances in the future.      The Kursk must be raised. Think of the nuclear reactors that it has on board. Think of the problems there will be in the future about radioactivity. For next generation this will be a very big problem. We must think now.      It is my opinion that the feelings of the bereaved relatives must be taken into account and, if it is possible to remove only the radioactive material, then the bodies of the submariners should be left in peace. However, if this is not possible and the only safe method of removal is to raise the entire submarine, then the environmental considerations MUST take precedence.      The Kursk should be raised as it will give a chance for the families of the dead seamen to give them a proper burial instead of leaving them in the cold dark water.      The Kursk is obviously an environmental disaster waiting to happen. It must be raised despite opposition from some of the families involved. Yet, after seeing botched Russian attempts to save the crew, I hope this venture will receive the full international backing it needs.      I think by now Russia should be thinking of raising the Kursk from the ocean. This should also sound a warning to our leaders that a nation is supreme because of its men and not its military exploits.      I do not know (like most other people) what state the main body of the submarine is in, but I do realise that the easiest and least dangerous way to raise the reactor will probably be whilst it remains in the submarine. It sounds harsh, but I therefore feel that the bodies of the seamen are somewhat of a lesser priority than the making safe of a nuclear reactor that will stay radioactive for a number of centuries - long after the submarine itself will have rusted to pieces.      The German battleship Blucher sunk in Oslofjord in World War II. Leaks of diesel 50 years later led to a substantial and dangerous operation to drain what remained. The Kursk is storing-up a similar, only worse, fate for future generations. Better to attempt the nuclear recovery now whilst information is available and the vessels structural integrity is intact. The needs of the relatives are also important. This may help them come to terms with their grief. Ideally the reactor and grave could be separated and the grave left alone, but this is unlikely. Better to plan how to deal with the bodies, and comfort the relatives as part of the operation.      Definitely the Kursk should be raised. A submarine is not a suitable tomb for human bodies and it is the right of every human, military or civilian to a dignified resting place. These men gave their lives for their country, the least Russia can do is put their souls to rest.      Ever since man ventured from the shore he has had to live with the possibility that he might never make it back. This is particularly true for the sailors in every navy in every period of time in the world's history. Submariners more than any other have had to live with the frightening reality that death under the waves would at best be quick and sudden, at the worst, slow and terrifying. These men knew the risks they had to take in order for them to do their jobs, and despite the dangers went to sea to serve their country. It is only fitting that men of this calibre, courage and tenacity should have the sea as their shroud. They are in gallant company. Do what can be done to contain any radioactivity, but let the men lie in peace.      The Kursk must be raised. We cannot afford to leave nuclear reactors, along with their sordid contents, rotting on the bottom of the ocean ready to mutate the DNA of any creature that swims past. Look at all the deformities and disease caused by the Chernobyl incident. Being out of sight under the sea does not make these evil substances any less harmful!      The Kursk should definitely be raised. It's only in 100 metres of water which isn't very deep. The environmental considerations should come first - not to mention finding out exactly what happened. This accident could provide us with knowledge for the future, making a second accident an impossibility.      While my heart goes out to the families of those poor sailors who died, I'm sure they would be the first to agree that there is no point in bringing up the bodies of their loved ones if others may die as a result. If, and only if, it is going to be 100% safe to bring up this submarine, should it be done. But the relatives of the dead should be asked first whether they want this to happen, or whether they would rather mourn them where they are.      It depends purely on the dangers in involved in such an operation versus the dangers of doing nothing and letting the waste leak out and contaminate the sea. While I have sympathy for the families of those who lost their sons on the sub, I am sure every soldier that enters any kind of army is aware of the risk to life and limb this implies, and Putin was wise not to interrupt the rescue effort with his personal presence      I doubt very much whether the decision to raise the submarine has anything to do with giving those who perished a proper funeral. The one and only reason to raise it should be due to radioactive contamination concerns. As for establishing once and for all the real cause of the accident, I doubt whether a visual inspection on the surface will change any minds. From all accounts, the front of the sub was devastated. Those Russian officials who still want to perpetuate the collision or old mine theory will still stand their ground. Just like the Egypt Air disaster, it doesn't matter what the evidence shows; these people have their interests to protect.      The Kursk should be raised in order to find out how and why it sank. Both the recovery and subsequent investigations should be performed by a multinational team to prevent anybody from tampering with the evidence.      It should be raised and the dead bodies given a decent mass grave and the Kursk taken as national monument.      Recovery of the bodies of the crew is not a sufficient reason for raising the Kursk -- the hundreds of ships that went down during the Second World War (many of them in shallow water) were not raised for that purpose either, nor, more recently, was the ferry Estonia which sank in the Baltic. If recovery of the reactor separately is sufficient to prevent environmental harm and is possible, then that should certainly be done. On the other hand I hardly doubt that the Russian Navy already knows exactly what caused the Kursk to sink.      There have been many comments about giving the dead a 'proper burial'. No one has actually asked the relatives of those that died if they want their bodies raised. Many will now have said their final goodbyes from a boat above a watery grave. If they want bodies brought up then fine, however, whilst the nuclear material needs to be rendered safe in some way, the families of those that died should have some say as to what happens to the bodies of their relatives. If this means that the whole submarine can be raised, great. If it means that the warheads and reactors only are salvaged, then that is what should be done.      Governments should stop riding roughshod over the feelings of the people and relatives of those that have lost their lives for their country. Equally, who are we in the Western world to tell the Russians what to do? they are a civilised country and can come to their own decisions as to what is the correct thing to do within their culture.      If it isn't raised, the environmental impact will be massive. However, to risk raising a hull weakened by two explosions could be even worse. The safest thing for all would be to make the reactors safe and no more.      Too many questions lie unanswered over the wreck of the Kursk. By raising the ship, perhaps we may be able to establish what happened to her and her crew, and how to prevent it happening again. When the complex issue of nuclear material lying on the ocean bed also comes into the equation, I don't think we can afford to let the Kursk lie. Any attempts to raise her should be executed and funded by the UN, so the truth is known and the cost not borne by a country with financial difficulties.      The Kursk should be raised not only to clarify the circumstances of its sinking but also to give the seamen who died a befitting burial. The Russian nation should be given the opportunity to honour these men posthumously. They died a horrific death, they do not deserve eternal imprisonment on the seabed.      What about the risks of leaving the submarine alone at the bottom of the sea? As the submarine corrodes it will inevitably leak radioactive waste into the ocean. It will eventually have to be dealt with. Raising it now, while complicated, will be no less complicated when the sub needs to be removed in the future and is in worst condition than it is now.      Our Russian allies should raise the Kursk, only if such action is the consensus of those families who lost loved ones.      The fact almost never mentioned is that the Kursk had on board nuclear-tipped warheads and torpedoes, which Command of the Northern Fleet desperately tried to deny. It is them that cause more danger than the plutonium on the submarine's reactor.      The question is do we raise it now while the hull is in reasonable sound condition or wait until the radio activity leaks causing a barren sea in which nobody can work. An alternative may be to encapsulate it in concrete and wait for technology to advance. Either way at some point those reactors must be raised.      I think only the radioactive material and arms should be salvaged from the Kursk. No doubt this would cost a lot less than salvaging the whole submarine and it reduce the risk to near by Norway.      Despite a complete lack of evidence to the contrary, senior Russian Admirals continue to suggest that the Kursk may have sunk after collision with a Western vessel. If raising the Kursk for all to see finally lays that theory to rest, then it is definitely worth it -- because it will force the Russian Navy to consider its own responsibility in the accident and its aftermath.      There would obviously be an ongoing risk of contamination in the future if the site weren't cleaned up now. Also it is necessary to find out exactly what happened in order to reduce the chance of another incident in the future. When there is an air crash at sea, all possible material is recovered for investigation. The same principle should be applied here.      Where's the respect for those young sailors who were allowed to die in horrific conditions? Raise the Kursk.      The Kursk should be raised purely so the families of those who died can lay their dead to rest. The Russian government is obviously only thinking of the money.      The Kursk submarine has a nuclear reactor on board. I presume that it is full of radioactive material, plutonium, which is a very dangerous substance. Has anybody considered the future costs and other implications of not raising the sub?      The Kursk cannot be left as it is anyway, because the radioactive material will be more dangerous in the long run. But wouldn't it be safer if those materials simply removed by divers?      I can understand the victim's families wanting to have their loved ones returned to them for proper burial and since Russia is financing this venture I see nothing wrong in that. But I am a little wary in regards to whether or not this is a health hazard and if there are not sufficient guarantees it might be better to wait until an international body of experts examines the feasibility of such an undertaking first.      NO NO NO - let these souls rest in peace. It will certainly not help the relatives to raise this wreck and it will not help the men who have the task either. I know someone who assisted in raising a sub nearly 20 years ago and he still has nightmares about it! All that and the cost and risk to more lives is just not worth it. Leave it buried at sea!!      There is no ship in existence which can raise the Kursk to the surface. The Kursk weighs over 5000 tons. The USA once attempted to raise a Russian submarine with the Glomar Explorer. The attempt failed. There is simply no technology at present which can safely snatch 5000 tons of waterlogged steel from the ocean floor.      Only the nuclear part should be raised. The bodies should be left there and it should be marked as a sea grave. As long as we are respectful of the dead we can still give them some dignity and take away the nuclear waste.      The Russians are the least qualified to raise the Kursk, or even to say if it should be.      I have worked for the company that will raise the Kursk. If T.J. Cassidy knew anything about it, the raising companies are American and Dutch. The Norwegian government are the ones who have requested and partially funded the recovery.      Raising the Kursk submarine is a bad idea for many reasons. It is a very risky operation that could ultimately see salvage workers and the environment in the Barents Sea area destroyed. It will cost a backbreaking amount of money, for an ailing Russian economy, that could better use this money to keep accidents such as the K-141 disaster from occurring again. Many of the families who lost their loved ones on August 12, 2000, wish their men to remain buried at sea. It would be heartbreaking to see them further upset by an already extremely painful incident.      Furthermore, the Russians will probably omit the infamous torpedo room compartment from this recovery mission. Without compartment I, it is unlikely that new answers can be provided as to what really caused this accident in the first place.      Whilst it was a tragic incident, which left many questions unanswered, is it really our place to make decisions for the Russians? They've had people in space and have the technological know-how to do many things which the UK can't. Let them decide for themselves. How would we appreciate it if the Russians told us how to solve the foot-and-mouth crisis? "
JOC JOC-12A-02N 0.64 "I can't understand how the people want to do cosmetic procedure feel. I shudder at the mere mention of it. Bury the implant in own face? Its so horrible! I don't understand the necessity of changing one's face through cosmetic-surgery. Patients have to run a risk as well as pay much money. If they want to restore their youthful look, they can have massages instead of cosmetic surgeries. They must be safer though it costs money and time.  I don't know whether cosmetic-surgery is right action or not. But I believe that it has a big risk to hurt our body. I want to change my body but I will not to change it because it is too dangerous.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think it's natural for people to want to get beauty and being confident in own looks is very important. Actually, people appearing on TV program featuring plastic surgery often look lively and nice after the operation. So I also think cosmetic procedure including ""chin jobs"" is one of ways to live happily for us and no one can criticize for that action.  i think it is really hard say whether cosmetic surgery is right or wrong. because as ID12028 say, it is natural that people wants to be beautiful and also other people say surgery involves high risk. but i believe if person wants to be beautiful he/she should do surgery because advance in medical technology can get rid of person's unconfident looks and make person's life happier. . . . . . maybe. . . .  I didn't agree with the cosmetic-surgery at first because it cost a lot like 1 million yen for just one, small operation. I thought it's waste of money and we should use the money for something else. But as ID12028 said, it's natural for people to want to get beauty. Some are not satisfied with their looking and envy their nice-looking friends. And in some cases, so-called ugly students become the target of bullying. So I understand their feeling. But I still cannot agree with the liposuction because it's just the result of lack of effort. If people want to get thin, they should reconsider their dietary habit and start exercising not just depending on surgery. I know some people cannot lose their weight because of some kind of diseases but in most of the cases, I guess such people are overeating. Anyway, I can agree with cosmetic-surgery except for liposuction.   sorry, ""1 million yen"" is correct To tell the truth, I don't really care whether they do cosmetic surgery or not. We humans have the right to chose whatever we wanted to do, so it's up to the individual choice. But if I were asked to do cosmetic surgery, I definitely won't do that. It seems very painful to me and, moreover, I feel sorry for my parents by hurting the body they gave me. But if an individual can augment happiness of his/her life by doing cosmetic surgery, I can't stop them. You only live once. Just try what you think is the best !! I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past.  I agree with ID12029 and ID12049's idea. Whether you have plastic surgery or not depends on individual liberty. If you want to become beautiful, you might have plastic surgery after deeply thinking risk of it failing. What is more important than this, you should not have prejudices against the people who have plastic surgery. Especially in Japan there is the number of the people who have biased view against plastic surgery. Incidentally I don't want to have plastic surgery because I am very afraid of being operated.  I think it dependent on the person whether cosmetic-surgery is carried out. In Japan, many people want to change their bodies. It is natural to want to become more beautiful. But I don't think so. This is because I want to take good care of myself.  I am sure there are a great number of people who wish to be more beautiful and imagine the result of cosmetic surgery. It is natural that living people seek the beauty. But I hear that it is too expensive and so risky that they tend to hesitate to have surgery. And, as ID12055's opinion, Generally Japanese tend to scorn people who underwent surgery. For example, some actresses whose figures have changed obviously are criticized on the Internet. I think this is the biggest issue about cosmetic surgery. We should be more tolerant to this matter. Whoever hopes and afford to have surgery ought to carry out without any hesitation. By the way, if I get rich in the future, I may hope surgery.  I heard that straightening our teeth helped us build up our health. I don't think too much cosmetic surgery is good, but I don't clearly say that cosmetic surgery should not done. Having cosmetic surgery makes people feel confident and happy.  I don't think I want to do cosmetic procedure because it costs a lot, and it's dangerous. But I can understand why many people want to do it. Of course, I admire the person who is a handsome. In the end, I think it's free to do cosmetic surgery or not.  I think cosmetic surgery is a way to lead a better life. If you do cosmetic surgery and can make your life better, it will be meaningful deed. However, even though you change your face, you can't your life unless you change yourself. And it costs a lot and may be dangerous. So you should drop into deep thought before you do cosmetic surgery.  Cosmetic surgery occasionally fails. So, this procedure has risks. But, I have no reason to disagree with cosmetic surgery. There are a lot of people who worry about their own looks. For some people, this problem influences their lives and works. So, I think it is inexpensive to dissolve these problem to spend money. Anyway, cosmetic surgery is a personal matter. Other people shouldn't interfere. If we undergo cosmetic surgery, we should do our responsibility and judgment.  I don't think people should not have cosmetic surgeries. Whatever we say, we are likely to judge others from their appearances. Therefore some people have senses of inferiority as they don't want to live any more. If they thought that they couldn't live without having cosmetic surgery, I think that will be OK. So I generally agree with cosmetic surgeries. But some people depend on cosmetic surgeries, run through their entire money, fail surgeries, repeat it endlessly, and fall into what we call 'cosmetic surgery hell'. Although I don't deny cosmetic surgeries, in order not to be in such traps, people should consider it again and again before having cosmetic surgeries.  I think cosmetic surgery is very important to some person. Because it becomes a tool in order to lead a good life. When I dislike my face, it may be able to lead the life it is better to cosmetic surgery. So I think cosmetic surgery is not but.  To be sure cosmetic surgery may be important to some people. I can understand their thought. But I can't think cosmetic surgery is good. At least I have not thought I want to do that. As many people said, cosmetic surgery cost a lot and is very dangerous. Doing something to body is very awful for me, even that is normal surgery.  I don't think plastic surgery is bad. I'm not woman, but I can understand of hoping to be beautiful. One of my eyelids is with no fold, and other is double-fold. I really dislike them! Men feel beautiful to the symmetry things. So my face is not beautiful I think. I think if their problems can be solved by money, it's so good. It's the best way, no one feel sad, everyone feels happy, if you understand operations' danger.  I think it's unnecessary to change each face. I have never thought that I'm handsome, and It's the natural that everyone wants to be handsome, pretty, beautiful, or nice face, however we should accept each inborn face. However ugly your face is, someone loves you!! In addition cosmetic surgery cost a lot and it's unsafe. In short I think it's needless I can understand feeling of people who want cosmetic surgery, but I don't want to do cosmetic procedure. Because it take a lot of money and it's very dangerous. I think everyone should have confidence to face more. I looked at the picture of Bruce Forsyth, I was surprised at the size of his chin.  Thinking to want to restore our youthful look is good . So I think cosmetic surgery is not bad. However cosmetic surgery hurts our bodies and it's very dangerous. Under certain circumstances we died from cosmetic procedure. So I think cosmetic surgery is not worth taking risks.  Cosmetic surgery has been popular recently in the world. I think it should be important if surgery is not endowed from the parent face. I want my children to cosmetic surgery is not absolute.  I suppose that these kinds of cosmetic surgery will be more popular in several years , and that not only in the US but in Asian countries such as China, South Korea etc, the demands for them will be rapidly increasing year after year. Today, these operations still cost too much, but as the technology is improving, these cost will lessen and many more people will undergo them without thinking seriously.  I think that we have freedom of choice. But it costs patients a lot of money to be operated on for cosmetic surgery and maintain their bodies or face. Furthermore, as the article, if people are operated, most of them come to want to be modify other parts. In the end, their bodies or face will lose their shapes. It is true that if you are operated, you may be beautiful and gain confidence. However, it is the only short term. So I strongly believe that it is better that you aren't operated.  A chin is charge of various functions such as mastication. Thus if we have cosmetic surgery on our chin, we may look nice, but the original functions may decline at the same time. I think we shouldn't have cosmetic surgery which exposes us to health hazards.  In Japan, implants are unusual surgery. The patients try to hide that they did cosmetic surgery. This is because Japanese environment can't accept cosmetic surgery as a usual thing. On the other hand, in America or Korea, many people do cosmetic surgery in order to become younger. It shows that America has many kinds of people in country, so that they are used to accept different points of each other. This is one of the good points of American culture. At this point, I think Japan should learn this culture.  I think it is okay to do cosmetic surgery if the person wants to do and need it. It is expensive and dangerous so I would not recommend the person to do so unless if the person really needs to.  I myself don't want to do cosmetic surgery. I think what the person is like is far more important than how he/she looks. On the other hand , I admit that there is a opinion such that ones first impression is quite important and it's greatly depend on ones features. So, I don't care other people do cosmetic surgery.  I think that the cosmetic surgery will damage your body or heart sometimes. The result after taking the surgery might be different from your ideal. I recommend that the person who wants to have cosmetic surgery need to think about that danger. I do not want to have the surgery because I feel so dangerous to have the surgery.  I think that it is individual freedom. Desire to become beautiful is a natural thing. Even if it is able to sympathize, I don't want to have plastic surgery. Plastic surgery is different from makeup or diet, I feel like it is denying oneself. Moreover life does not necessarily become bright just because you have plastic surgery. Not only appearance but an inside is important. Things will turn out fine if you have enough determination.  I think people who have plastic surgery abandon themselves. If you want to look better, you need to make extra special efforts. I never thought of having plastic surgery, but I have been trying various things to look better such as doing some running and restricting the amount of food for reducing fat. People should confront themselves and do their best to get better look.  When I read this article, I think this news shows how Japanese and people around world feels about plastic surgery. I had read the article that 80% of Korean have plastic surgery (Not sure all Korean or only women). Also, many of them publicize that they had plastic surgery. On the other hand, Japanese want to hide whether they had plastic surgery. I think this is one of examples that show Japanese ""shame"" culture.  I think that plastic surgery is no good. Faces are one of most characteristic parts of people. To process them would confuse their relationships, have a bad influence. When you want to change yourself, you should improve your inside.  I can understand why there are people who would like to change their body or face by plastic surgery. They believe that if they get their ideal bodies and faces, they could get their ideal lives. But, I think that plastic surgery is not good. Our bodies and faces are given by our parents. If we change our bodies and faces by performing operations on those, they must unpleasant. So, I don't think I would like to have any plastic surgeries.  I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence.  I have some complex with my face. But I haven't want to have plastic surgery. Because my face is important identity of myself. If you change your face and body by plastic surgery, it means that you lose your identity. If you change your face, you lost reliance and have more complexes about your looks. So I think that plastic surgery should not be done in any account.  I think whether people decide to change their faces or other parts should be depended on their own mind. For some people who think their looking is not good, it may be wonderful that they can modify their bodies with new technology. But I am concerned about something. Do surgeons give customers enough information about their operations?There must be some risks with the procedure. The customers should know about them. The doctors should explain the details of the operations to their customers and the customers should think with that explanation.  I am opposed to cosmetic surgery. This is because it may lead people who get the operation to being frustration. For example, Michael Joseph Jackson had had an operation in succession because of his wish that he wanted to be more beautiful.  I don't understand why people want to change their own face. Their face came from parents therefore it might make parents feel bad.  I firmly think committing a cosmetic surgery is not good. I always emphasis that naturality is the best. Naturality helps people to maintain own existence. Furthermore, it makes more variety world, and society. I think having a cosmetic surgery means concealing own existence. Besides, however medical treatment has improved, actually there are tremendous risk when doing cosmetic surgery. Sometimes cosmetic surgery brings terrible side effect. Therefore, I think doing cosmetic surgery is no proper.  It is good for us to mind ourselves and make ourselves better on outlook. But i don't think cosmetic surgeon is good for anyone because we are the children of God. We are given our own body and it's natural for us to differ from each other. So we should be proud ourselves and enjoy crude ourselves.  Personally , I can't accept the cosmetic surgery because there is a high possibility of failure. If operation fails, patients will perhaps suffer more than ever before. But cosmetic surgical procedure may give some people hope. So I think no one can criticize such operations.  I'm really sorry to be late for posting my comment. I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.  I don't think that cosmetic-surgery is good. Because doing it costs much money and one mistake can cost a person his life. I don't agree that South Korean people operate with ease. I think that the face is personal, so cosmetic-surgery shouldn't do easily without considering well.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery as I understand that everyone would prefer looking better. I would not hate myself not just because my looking is not perfect, but I would be more satisfied with my appearance if my eyes were bigger, face was smaller, and etc. Since the technology and techniques we have today have extremely improved in the last few years, it should not be criticized as much for the people to have cosmetic surgery. Like ID12003 said in his comment, cosmetic surgery may give some people 'hope', which can be explained as hope to live, smile, and love themselves.  Technology and techniques* I disagree with plastic surgery in two ways. Firstly, plastic surgery can industrialize the medical system. As our society is appearance-oriented, plastic surgery is in high demand. Plastic surgeons can make a lot of money these days as well. Thus, many medical students apply to specialize in plastic surgery. On the other hand, specializations important for public health, like internal medicine and general surgery are waning due to the lack of talent, as these departments promises significantly lower pay as compared to being a plastic surgeon. This tendency polarizes the medical system and threatens public health. Secondly, plastic surgery can undermine individuality. With the plastic surgery, people can transform their appearance to whatever they want. Because media broadcasts a unified look, people admire that particular appearance, and seek to achieve that through plastic surgery. Thus it can be said that plastic surgery and the media makes people lose their individuality. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with plastic surgery.  I agree with cosmetic surgery because all the people have a complex. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good. There is prejudice for cosmetic surgery still more in Japan and will take time so that cosmetic surgery becomes common Because doing cosmetic surgery is not only making people beautiful, also fixing the part of his/her wrong body part. When i was in Canada, my friend got hit by a baseball and broke his nose, and when he came back from hospital his face looks weird. so he did cosmetic surgery and fix his nose. so i strongly disagree with just saying cosmetic surgery is bad.  I agree because she out the problem I also considered. we think that the prejudice for surgery is one of the biggest issues.  I agree with cosmetic surgery. It is common around the world except Japan. I think it depends on private liberty. Even though there is still a prejudice about plastic surgery in Japan, the time will come when it is in general use.  I think it is free for individuals to reform their face. Butt I don't agree to cosmetic surgery, because I don't want to reform myself. I want you to think well cosmetic surgery like this news.  Human's pursuits of beauty know no bounds. If the patient feels satisfied, that's OK, I think, but personally I don't want to be operated any plastic surgeries because there is a big risk of malpractice.  I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. It's true that most of us have a hope to change our face. I think my face is our parents' present, so however ugly it looks, it shouldn't be changed. Moreover, changing the face so much is bad for crime prevention too.  I am for the cosmetic surgery. It won't be a big deal to others, also, it would be the chance to make them feel confident. I suppose people who want to do it have difficulty feeling themselves confident. Cosmetic surgery surely help them deal such problems.  I think everybody can do the cosmetic surgery if they want to . no one has the right to stop them and also, people have the right to do what they want to. I know that all the girls want to look nice and pretty, and I think there are no problem about what they think. Some people say that ""your face is given from your parents so don't change it"" but I don't think so . Children can't choose their own face when they are born. If people can't be positive or happy because they think they look ugly, I think they should do the cosmetic surgery.  I do not entirely agree with cosmetic surgery, but if some think cosmetic surgery make themselves confident and positive, I think it's good. Recently, a more casual type of cosmetic surgery called ""Puchi-seikei"" have become famous. Yet, there are some cases of failure in surgery operated by uncertified doctor, so people should be careful.  I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.  It's because I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. Your body was inherited, in other words, given by your parents. The right to change your body is not only yours, so I disagree with it.  I think un orthopedist should be permit.  I have same opinion about cosmetic surgery, too. I want to straighten my teeth because I want to grin with confident, not smile. If I have straightened my teeth, I will have confident to laugh. I think it is natural for people to want their look nice.  I see that it is horrible to bury the implant in own face, but I don't agree with this opinion. I guess someone who wants to make them beautiful has very strong mind. They want to change their face from the bottom of their heart. They don't think it is horrible to bury the implant in order to make them beautiful. That is why I disagree with that opinion.  I think doing cosmetic surgery is personality problems and it's natural to want to be more beautiful especially for women, so I think it's permitted for anyone. People selecting cosmetic operation have the rights to live freely. In fact, people became good-looking must have confidence in them and also become happy. It's the most essential thing in nice life.  I've commented almost the same thing. There is no reason to deny the plastic surgery since it does not harm anyone as long as the surgeon makes mistake. It would make the patients feel confident and also make them look nice. What's the problem? I think shaping is scary. That is damage to the body.  I totally disagree with this comment. I know that our face is given from parents. . . but so what? Children can't choose their face. If they look ugly, and feel bad about it, they can't live happily. All the people have a right to live happily. It is written in our national constitution. Satisfaction with face will make people positive. Being positive, you can make more friends. It's not always like this, but I just wanted to say that this happiness chain is likely to happen. About crime prevention, I don't understand what he means at all. It's no matter who change the face and although if cosmetic surgery is considered as illegal, the victims change their face if they need to. Law can't stop victims doing cosmetic surgery.  I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence. Machi Hattori I agree this comment. Face is fact of identity for a people, and it is important for them.  It is true that the concept of handsome will vary according to the country the person belongs, but whether to change his/her face is entrusted to oneself so I believe we can just leave them to make their won choice by themselves.  I think it is freedom to do cosmetic-surgery or not. If you want to be more beautiful, it is the one way to realize it. I think there is no problem you will be more positive and enjoy your life by doing cosmetic-surgery. But it is necessary to consider about costs, danger and so on.  I agree with ID12028. That's why all the people have a complex. plastic surgery involves danger. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good.  I agree with this opinion because I have same idea as him. In modern society, decision about oneself is freedom. Because of this, no one can interference with personal decision. This comment reflect this kind of spirit very well. If I have to choose agree or not, I disagree with plastic surgery. But I think let plastic surgery as personal liberty is democratic thing.  I disagree to having plastic surgery. It is because there are no bounds to improve the section that we don't like in our face. So, it is wasteful to invest money in the plastic surgery.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think appearance is the most important of first impression. Also, when I choose my girl friend, appearance is the most important factor.  I found it surprising that people are age want to have a plastic surgery. It will obviously make your appearance good now but I do not think it will stay forever. Appearance will be consumed by time anyway but loosing your appearance without it being consumed, I think it's kind of pathetic.  I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past. I do not agree to this as I do not like the fact that people want to change their faces. Even though it is a minor change, your body was born from mother who suffered pain to give birth to you so I think you should take care of your body.  I strongly disagree with the person who wrote this comment. He should not have written such a thing as it might hurt those people who wish for cosmetic surgery. I do not think he will ever understand other people's feelings.  I thought this comment makes a good point. I think that it is definitely natural for people to get beauty and confidence in own looks. I also agree with the idea that no one should criticize the people who wish to have that 'natural thing' for them to live the only one life they have.  I am not against people having plastic surgery strongly because sometimes, getting a good looks would change one's life in a better way. But I still can't have a good understanding for it. Having a plastic surgery means that they will not be able to see their real faces or body again. Especially for face, it could also mean that their baby wont have the same look as their parent forever. And for their parents, they wont be able to see the face of their child that reminds of their wife or husband anymore. I think this is really sad thing. Now a days plastic surgery is getting easier to have and in some country it is thought as something normal to do. But I think people should think a lot before having it especially if they were young.

JOC JOC-12A-03N 0.54 "I tried to make good vocabulary notes every time, but I have never made perfect vocabulary notes. Also, this is the first time which I thought about how to write good vocabulary notes again. I saw some notes in class, and I could find what is important to make a good note. I should write meanings, parts of speech, pronunciation, accent, and examples. Moreover, I think world maps are important part for good vocabulary notes. By using world maps, we can learn not only one word but also other words which connect with one word at the same time. Word maps help us to learn many words. From now on, I want to make a beautiful vocabulary note in order to improve my English skill! I have made vocabulary notes just like the first example of one. but, I realized it is not good when I read this article. My note is no accent and example sentence and so on. I think that word maps is good idea. It becomes easy to understand the connection of the sentence make a good note refer to this example notes. I will try to make a good note refer to example vocabulary notes .  I have made my original vocabulary notebook including collocations and word senses, for around seven years. It gradually contained a lot of information, so I have revised it several times. Recently I forgot lots of information on it. I think my note have two faults. First it is too large to carry . It is B5 size, so I cannot review what I wrote on mine when I am on the crowded train. The next note should be smaller. Secondly I have not written English sentences and word's meanings in English. That is why I easily forget what I wrote. When I make the next, I will improve those faults.  I want to refer to the third example of vocabulary note because each main words are very distinct and easy to find, also, we can remember the word family at the same time. Its knowledge will be necessary to write English composition. When I make my vocabulary note, I want to add the meanings of the words in an English-English  dictionary. I think it can be useful for not only when we need to explain a word to another non-native speaker (according to this article), but also understanding real notion of the words. I really want to improve my English skill by ma king vocabulary note.  I think most important for vocabulary note is careful. For example beautiful character, tidied up carefully etc... Because carefully vocabulary note is motivated to us compared with a dirty note. I would like to refer to the first example vocabulary note. But it is not good as it is. It is necessary to add the above some element. I am poor at English. So I absolute necessity perfect vocabulary note. From now on, I would like to make the perfect note.  So far, I have written only Japanese meanings and synonyms in my vocabulary notebooks. This method is adequate just for expanding the vocabulary and enhancing reading skills. However, in developing writing and reading skills, adding example and collocations to the notebooks will be better. I'm often puzzled about how to use words when writing and speaking. Now, I'll try this new method. Writing part of speech and pronunciation may also be good way of improving listening and speaking skills, but it must be much better to listen to native native speaker's pronunciation.  As you know, it is very easy to learn English in Japanese if you are not good at English. We Japanese usually think matters in Japanese, so I suggest them to learn English in Japanese at first. But after you get used to learning English, I mean after you have less problem using English, especially communicating in English, it is very important to learn English through English. That's because you never understand nuance of English if you keep on learning them through Japanese. I also recommend to learn English using an illustrative sentence. It is very effective to know how the word is used, and you can borrow those phrases when you actually write or speak English. But what we have to pay attention to most is that you shouldn't get satisfied just making vocabulary notebooks. What is important is to remember the words and have a chance to use them. You should make them in a way that is easy for you to remember in the most effective ways. Tips for those who is not good at remembering words: Aren't you using many hours just making vocabulary notebooks? Then stop that and reconsider why you are doing such a thing. That is to remember the words and actually using them in writings or in the real situations! I think that there are three points to make better vocabulary notebooks. Firstly, you should write the words' meanings and accents. Of course, the purpose to make vocabulary notebooks is to learn the words that you don't know. It is easy to learn them by knowing their meanings . Furthermore, if you learn their accents, you can pronounce them. So you are able to learn their words not only by the sense of sight but also by the sense of hearing. Secondly, you should write the example sentences of them. By example sentences, you will be able to learn how to use them. And you can learn collocation. There are synonyms but words have also nuance. If you don't know collocation, you may not be able to convey your feeling. So it is necessary to write example sentences. Finally, you should write the images of the words. How to write is a picture, sentence and so on. If you have the images, it will be easy for you to learn the words. This is because the words become memorable and lead to collocation. Therefore, I recommend three points.  When I learn new words, I lay emphasis on their practical use. If you learned a new verb by just memorizing its spelling and meaning, you will manage to understand the meaning of the verb in most passages. However, when you write compositions or speak in English using that verb, you will be at a loss about what is proper preposition for the verb , or what noun to use together, or the pronunciation of it. Thus I think that there's no use making a vocabulary notebook only with English words and their Japanese meanings, and that you should write the co-locations, pronunciations, and part of speech of new words to make a useful vocabulary notebook. In fact, rarely have I made a vocabulary note so far, so I will improve my vocabulary by making and using vocabulary notebook.  I started to remember the English word from the middle grades become, until now to write an English word to the left, we have to remember to write the meaning next to it in Japanese. Note that I can not explain the meaning to native speakers, however. I do not know well what I say with how if you did not write a sentence using that word again. And now I think I want to make a note using the color easy to see the English meaning, and example sentences using the word rather than just write the meaning of a word in Japanese so.  When I was a high school student, I made my vocabulary notebook. But it was written only the meanings of the words. I think the vocabulary note is practical more. So I try to do new methods of vocabulary notes. First, I try to use word maps. But it was difficult to understand and taking long time. So I try to add the example sentences. Example sentences are useful for memorizing words. I want so I don't forget that continue to make the vocabulary notes.  I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes of all. Whenever I study English, I feel necessity to think in English. I'm poor at English. So, I always think English sentences and words through Japanese. This thinking way takes much time and sometimes makes mistakes. So, I want to learn the way to think from English to English directly. I'm going to make a vocabulary note like the second example as first step for English-English thinking.  I think that no one knows what the perfect vocabulary notebook is. Because we have different own English ability, so what we want to need about English vocabulary notebook is different from each other. For example, when I was a high school student I want to memorize English words and its Japanese meanings. So I devoted much time to reading. Thanks to this study, I know many English words and its meanings. But I don't know how to use those words. This study is of no practical use. So refer to ""Vocabulary Notebooks"", I am going to search the most fittest notebook to me.  There are difference between studying English and just learning English words by heart when we make the vocabulary notes. First, when we want not only to memorize words but also to study English, we should write many related words;collocations, word map, and synonyms on the notes. On the other hand when we just want to memorize English words, we should write English words and meaning by Japanese or English.  I have made some vocabulary notes since junior high school student. There were various notes. I have already tried first, second and third examples of this article. And I like the style of first example. I think that type is clear and easiest to memorize. Of course, it is useful that there are English meanings or example sentences and I can remember other information. But my notes with too many information were often complex and it was hard to continue to memorize the words. So I want to try other type of notebooks but try not to make too complex notebooks. I want to create notebooks that are best to memorize for me.  I'm poor at learning English words. So I can't speak like native speaker. If the thing I want to speak comes to my mind in Japanese, I can't translate it to in English because my vocabulary is too poor. But I'm sometimes said ""Your English is not bad. Are you good at English?"" I can't understand why they think it. But when I speak English, I try to use easy English and I think it is better to continue speaking than think of difficult expression. I want to speak difficult things, I explain it by easy English. So my best way to learn new English is to explain that word by my word.  When I make my I wrote only Japanese meaning so far. This style is so easy to do. But, It isn't good for learning English. I think, is most effective method. However, It is lacking. When I make my vocabulary note next time, I will write Japanese meaning, pronunciation, and word family as third example. And, I will write example sentence, too. I want to make perfect vocabulary note! I think english meaning notebook is the best. I have been made english meaning notebooks which written main word and synonym. It is useful because you can memorize many words at once. If you use this method, you can remember another word even if you forget word which you want to speak.  When I made vocabulary notebooks, I wrote only English words, Japanese meanings, and synonyms. So I sometimes had trouble making English sentences because I didn't know how to choose the correct English word. By incorporating example sentences and word map like the second example and the fourth example, I can make efforts to realize the improvement of my English skills. I will practice these ways in order to make the best vocabulary notebook for me.  There were only English words and Japanese meanings in my vocabulary notebook. I had thought it was enough. However, When I saw several notebook example, I noticed my notebook was incomplete. I should write accents , pronunciation, example sentences and family words. It may take a lot of time. But if I do not so, it'll take more much time to remember and understand English words. I want to improve my English notebook and make my English ability better!! I have made vocabulary notebooks only like first type. It is easy to make, and it is specialized in memorizing only english words and their meanings. However, especially when I write English compositions, I have no idea on how to use and link english words, even if I know words and their meanings. Just being linked with their meanings doesn't consist right sentences. So it is necessary to learn collocations.  I thought that I have to improve my note. After last lesson(week), I thought I have to improve my note and did it, However, I still have some points to improve. I realized that electronic dictionary has example sentences and pronunciations, but it is not enough to make a good note.  After had a lesson which learn about taking notes, I had realize that my note is too simple. So, I improved my note within 3 points. First, I added example. I think memorizing word with example is important, example helps people to memorize more easily, and properly. Second, I marked a accent. Since flow is important in English, word cannot be a complete English without considering accent. Third, I added synonym, memorizing synonym provide people to memorize wide range of words, also it helps to write natural sentences.  Though it is not interesting for me to make a vocabulary note, that is very important in order to speak English more fluently. I will make my own note soon and want to be a good English speaker. But i wonder how often check the words i don't know . If i check all the words, i must be tired. Could anyone tell me how often i should look up the words i don't know? I have never thought about the good vocabulary notebooks. so this article gave me the opportunity to improve my vocabulary notebook. I took in the collocation and synonyms for my own notebook. I think my new notebook will improve my English skills. But the most important thing is continuing, not beginning. Therefore, I want to continue using new vocabulary notebook.  I have never thought about ""What makes a good vocabulary book"". However in this class lesson I came to have a first chance to see many types of vocabulary books and to think which one helps more. I tried every types after the lesson and finally, I chose the one with English meanings. Now I'm using it almost everyday and it helps me a lot! I used to make vocabulary notes in many ways when I was high school student, but I could never make the best one. However, I found a ""better"" way to make it. It's ""Word Map"" style! I could learn many words by making and using this. One of the good feature of this way is that you can learn other words related to the word you wanted to learn at first. So I think ""Word Map"" is a good vocabulary note.  I think that it is very important for me to write good vocabulary note books. But I was a high school student, I had written English words on the left , and Japanese meanings on the right. Though I could pass the entrance examination war, I realized that I would forget vast English words and Japanese meanings quickly. To memorize them effectively, I think that it is the best method for me to use a map which students has divided the word into its different word senses. ""Since English word has a lot of meanings, its method will enable me to memorize many senses with putting them in order.  I think that the vocabulary notebook that words' meanings are written in English is the best. Because, it makes us to get used to English, and we can also learn other words when we look up one word. But, if the word is very difficult, it is necessary to add Japanese.  When I was studying for entrance examination, I used flash cards to remember english words. A good point of this method is that a word's meaning came into my head as soon as readying a phrase. However, I had a little difficulty using words in conformity with the contexts. From this experience, I enumerate several synonyms, clarifying in which context the word should be used.  I want to make notes such as second example and third example. But I'm taking notes like first example. Although there is a lot of missing information , but I think first example is the best note because it is very simple and I get used to making it.  I make a vocabulary notebook from when I was a junior high school student. It is like first example. . . but, after I see those some way of making notes, I thought that I should reconsider my vocabulary notebook!! I think it is better that there are example sentences and the word's pronunciation for my improvement of English skill. In this class, I could know good ways of making notes!! thank you!! I makes vocabulary notebooks from when I was a freshman of the junior high school student. I am not good at remembering English words. So I made a lot of vocabulary notebooks. And I used to made vocabulary cards. To make vocabulary notebooks and vocabulary cards is best way to learn English words by heart. I learned a lot of things in this class.  I think vocabulary notebooks is very important tool to memorize the words or foreign languages. It's true that Simplifying the layouts to see clearly is necessary, but only re-read the note on which written down the meaning of the word for two languages is not effective. The most important is "" how the words are used"". So, when we make the notes, we must memorize the example sentence. "
JOC JOC-12A-07O 0.81 "The proportion of people aged 65 or over will get higher, it means the working population will decrease. It is not good to Japanese society because if the working population of Japan decrease, Japan becomes weaker. The retiring age in Japan is 60 in the status quo but now the time to change this system to increase the working population, I think.  I don't think we need to be apprehensive that lack of labor force makes Japan fall national power. It is because industrial robots will make up lack of labor force. However, it's not mean that we can take a rosy view. Japanese government will not collect a lot of tax. Japan's pension scheme might unravel. I think that Japanese government must consider its plans.  I think this problem has a big effect on Japan. At first, the pension system will collapse. It is said that today two young Japanese people pay for a pension of one elderly people. If the number of the elderly sharply increases in the future, we will not have the enough number of young people who can pay pensions. Moreover, some young people emigrate foreign countries because they wonder whether they can get pensions when they get old and they don't want to pay high pensions. In these ways, this problem will weaken the national strength of Japan. Therefore, we need to have measures to this problem; for example, raising the age of pensioner and making labor opportunities for the elderly by extending the retirement age.  I think there are three key ways in order to get the labor fore. One of them is employing people aged 65 or over. As employers get older the salary becomes high under current salary system(but it is collapsing these days) , so I think employees don't willingly hire aged . However, I think it is wasteful for corporations or employees to dismiss elderly people because they have valuable experiences accumulated for a long time. Other one is employing women. Although the number of working women is increasing , they quit the job in their early age because of caring children, nursing and so on. We should make society which is comfortable for working women. The last one is introducing foreigners. I think We should solve problems to accept them, for example cultural differences, the gap of language and limitation of license. But we are compatriot of the earth so I hope we can help each other. I think we should make attractive and enlivened Japan where foreigners want to immigrant.  I think Japan have to accept immigrants to support labor force I have two reasons. First, now birth rate is decreasing and we can't bring up manpower right now Moreover, there are a lot of young people who think it's difficult to have family. So we can temporary Second Aging people have handicap. It is definitely unavoidable. Even if they can work in social activity, they can't take part in some of the jobs because of their handicap. So we have to make up for the lack with accepting immigrants Although there are a lot of problems to accept immigrant, we can't solve this problem right now. That is why I think we have to accept immigrants.  I think economic prosperity encourages the young people to have families most. The richer their lives become, the more people will decide to get married and have families. Then I think the older's taking part in economic activities and using more money are important. The rate of the older has been increasing rapidly. It should not be good to let them all retire because they are so many and they can still contribute to economy with their experiences. We have to get more flexible and accept the change of the structure of labor. And, many of the older keep much money because they tend to spare money for the future or their grandchildren. The market should change their thoughts on money and attract their attention more to encourage them to use more money.  Problems of aging society will impose heavy burden on young people and Japanese economy. To keep and improve Japanese economy, we need to help elderly people work longer so that they can share their great experiences and techniques with younger generations. In addition, the government and companies should enable young people to work and take care of their children or elderly parents at the same time more easily in various ways such as supporting financially and enriching a child care leave system. Moreover, it may be a good way to accept foreign workers especially from Asian countries. Even though this is a serious matter, it might be a big opportunity to reconsider the system of our society and make it better. I hope that Japanese people think about this problem in a positive manner.  I think this problem is very serious. Present Japan is hyper aging society, so to increase elderly people and decreasing young people is dangerous problem. I think growing the opportunity that aging people get their job should be conducted immediately. In future, the old people will support the society.  Japan is a eminent country where many people live to an advanced age and I think we are able to be proud of it. However, I think it is not good that a birthrate is being declined every year and the government leaves the present society system. First, the government must arrange an environment of child care. Now, the number of day care centers is not enough at all and a return of people who took a maternity and child-care leave is difficult. Many Japanese young people came to find out almost only trouble in a marriage and being blessed with children. The government must support them so that they can find out happiness in a marriage and child care. Second, it is important to support that elderly people can participate in the labor market or in social activities. There are many elderly people who don't know what to do with their free time and ability. It is good that they play an active part in realm of child care. Then economic productivity will increase and I think the situation will take a turn for the better future.  Declining the total fertility rate is the most tragic problem in Japan. This problem is heavily linked to the aging society. I want the Japanese government to spend more money to help parents with bring up their children. In Switzerland, the total fertility rate is amazingly high though there are many married couples who both work. One of the reasons of that is in that country, parents can be given much money from the government. I think Japan should solve the problem by imitating Switzerland in such a point.  To solve this problem, I think the Japanese government should take a new look at a social security system to people can have babies with no concern, for example, about return to their job. If there are a lot of baby in Japan, they will be the labor force in the future. Also, the Japanese government should give elderly people more opportunity in their job. Certainly, elderly people have less strength than young people, but they have a lot of knowledge and experience and can teach young people. It is important that elderly people feel they participate in the society.  A elderly person is increasing, and children are decreasing. That mean workers are decrease. Although the elderly person receive a pension, the young workers are very few, so their pension tax become too heavy gradually. Moreover they are worried about their future whether they will be able to receive plenty of pension or not. That is also one of the factor they put off their family and children. If the young person save money and expenditure for their future , a economic condition go on getting worse. However long we are waiting, this bat cycles have not improved at all. If a good situation they are able to have a family and baby is prepared, the people who would like to have these positively is not increase probably. That problem is serious, so Japanese government should cooperate with companies for making good systems which people have family and baby positively . Companies should make a more kind system they take a maternity leave , and they can come back their work. It should be not only for women, but also for men. The government should discuss it in the Diet, and take positive measures to deal with the complex problems. The problem's effect is incomprehensible at soon, but if we postpone dealing with the problem, this become too serious to solve later on . I know this is so difficult , but we should do anything for our better society.  I feel that certainly an aging population has many problem, but we should adapt to the environment positively. As a first step, we should prepare working opportunities for elderly people who are keen to remain in the labor market or in social activities. Certainly they don't have much physical strength, but they have a lot of wisdom for life. So I think if we can prepare not physically hard working opportunity (for example teaching) for them, the situation around us will be changing.  Some older people live for work, the other older people live for having a good time with their family, exercising favorite sports. To face each other this problem, we must think their old age of happy. I suggest policy for aging society. First, agency must hold a seminar for them. they support how to write a resume, how to build contacts. It makes happy for older people who want to work. Second, We must establish opportunity for older people with younger people. It's important for us to live close together in aging society. I think we must create society which older people can freshly live.  Today, Japanese society has been aging increasingly. I have heard this repeatedly. I consider what I can do at every time. Of course, it cannot stop that elderly people increase in number. Therefore, it is important for elderly people to make the society which lives easily for elderly people. Especially I sympathized with ""aging people can participate in the labor market"" described with this report. Because it is impossible to perform this thing , I would like to keep on continuing to consider this.  According to this article, the population aged 65 or over will reach nearly 40% of Japan's population in 2060. This is not for Japanese economy because this means that the workforce is getting reduced. I think that we have to do something we can do to improve the situation. For example, we have to change pension system to take care of elderly people. Also, I think companies should hire more and more people aged 65 or over. Nowadays, there are not enough job opportunities for elderly people, but I think this is unfair for them if they want to work. Furthermore, Japanese economy getting worse, the number of people who have babies has been declining. I think this is very severe problem. Therefore, I really want everyone to think about such problems, and the government to make plans to solve them.  My country is decreasing young people. More and more working people will decrease in the future. So Japan's government takes measure to this situation. For example, companies hire more over 65 people as over 65 people can get a lot of work. There should be a lot of work that they can do. If so we may secure the work force. In this way, I think that the government should take some measures immediately.  I think increasing the population of people aged 65 or over is a serious problem. So we have to think about the way of managing. One is how to increase young people, another is how to look after aging people. The more aging people increase, the bigger the burden young people deal.  I was surprised when I read this article. I knew Japan is an again society, but I didn't know the proportion of people aged 65 or over will reach nearly 0.4 of Japan's population in 2060. It's serious problem. Even now, there are many problems about elderly . For example having lack of care givers and nursing facilities. Progressing Japan's technology has treated various disease and people have been able to live a long life. It's wonderful, but there are few people helping the elderly. So, I think that it is important for us to keep a lookout on each elderly and live together.  If we leave something as it is, The proportion of people aged 65 or over is 0.5 or over. I think Japanese government should make a chance elderly works. It is wasteful that elderly want to work abound. If they work, the economy grow and cost they support increase fully.  I think, in order to face this aging problem, Japan's government should propose policies not only for elderly people but also young people. Because, If young people worry about their future and emigrates to the foreign countries, Japan's economy will decline and government cannot afford for paying pension for elderly people. I think this vicious cycle should be broken as soon as possible.  Medical care developed in the present age, and a human average life span spread. Therefore there are many cheerful people even if they become 65 years old. It is necessary to provide the employment opportunity to the elderly person to rebuild economy turning worse of Japan.  I think it is really deeply problem especially economic conditions. Already, we can't stop the increasing population of elderly. I hope robots will take part of labor force instead of human in the future.  When I read this article, I remember my high school teacher's words. He said to us, ""you have to know that your generation is to be hard because you have the twice elderly people when you are working. "" This situation is unavoidable so I want to continue to thinking and leaning.  I think so, too. I think that changing the age of the resignation I let the working population increase and economy of Japan activate.  Your comments is true. That's reason is medical care developed in recent year. My town's old people increase. I meet many old people. We must protect an old man from now, because it is them to have brought up present Japan.  Since we are facing this big issue, we have to increase the number of young people. there are many possible answers to this question, like immigrants, but there are also as much problems as the answers are.  It is very serious problem about aging for Japan. Working power will be decrease and Japan's power too. I think we have to developing robot and use substitute for man-power. We use robot for work, supply foods, make energy. It is one way to solve the aging problem. "
JOC JOC-13A-07N -0.9 "What I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that listeners can understand the contents without any efforts. We should not care small grammatical mistakes, but we should explain general points of the contents to the listeners. To do so, we have to speak slowly and clearly and speak with loud voice, of course in easy English. Also, eye-contact must be done in order to impress the listeners. And I thought it is interesting to offer quizzes or movies or pictures in presentations in order not to bore listeners.  Doing presentation in Japanese is difficult for me. Of course, doing presentation in English was so difficult that I couldn't do that well. To do a good presentation, first, I think the words used in the script should be easy to understand. My script contained some difficult words and phrases. Such words or phrases bother the listeners. Second, presenter should make good eye contact. Only reading the script makes the listener bored. Third, good slides and clear main point are needed. Good slides attract the interest of listener and clear main point help understand the news. Next time, I want to do presentation better.  I think eye contact and clear voice is important for doing good presentation. It is because eye contact is needed to see whether people understand or not. And, I can make themselves understood by clear voice. What is more, good slide is also needed to help people understand. That is all.  I learned two things for doing a good presentation in English through the last class. First, I learned that memorizing the manuscript is important to make a speech without any trouble at all. In fact, the speech of Akiya and Mayu, who memorized their own manuscript were easy to hear. Second, I find the influence of the figures and the pictures. No matter how we make a good manuscript, the words lose the figures and the pictures in the impact. Expressing the main points in figures or pictures is important for a good presentation.  Important things of doing presentation is careful preparation and playing it by ear. If prepare carefully the presentation, we can doing presentation to relax. Besides if see audience, one can play it by ear in the presentation, the presentation become perfect. Preparation of my presentation in the last class was not perfect. So, I got into a panic. But I could play it by ear, finally Mr. Marchand smiled.  What I think the important for doing a good presentation in English is doing eye contact with listeners regularly. I think that we have good communication by doing eye contact. And, by doing so, a presenter see whether listeners can understand or not. I think that eye contact is the most important for doing a good presentation in English.  I learned that a presenter need lead and help a listener join the presentation and I think the following two ways are important to make a good presentation. The first way is asking questions during the presentation. This way is very good because both a presenter and listeners join and make a presentation together. All the students I listened to did ask some questions to draw out my reaction. Thanks to them, I enjoyed the news stories without feeling bored. Asking questions makes listeners think about the topic more deeply and react to the presentation. The second way is eye contact. At first, I was too nervous to look at my listener, but it seemed to make her a little uneasy. Then I tried to make eye contact to see her reaction. As a result, she appeared to be relieved and understood the contents better. Moreover, I got comfortable to speak to her. I realized that making eye contact is very important for both a presenter and listeners.  If we want to teach something by presentation, we have to use easy words and speak slowly and clearly. When I watched TED, nobody speak while looking their script. They are not just say something, they tell and listen audience's reaction, sometimes they ask a question to the listener. They communicate with audience. In contrast, sometimes I read my script, and spoke unclearly. I just spoke one-sidedly, so I can't tell all of things that I want to convey. I think communicating with audience is important for doing presentation in English.  I think it important to speak with the enthusiasm that I want to convey. I cannot speak English well. But when I do my presentation, I try to speak more clearly, loudly and slowly. Because I want to convey information in my presentation. And I think the enthusiasm reaches audiences. So we should have the enthusiasm that I want to convey when we do a presentation.  My opinion is that there are 2 big points for doing a good presentation in English, which are thinking about listener and making a good Power Point. First, we need to think about listener because the purpose of presentation is to have listener understand what we want tell them. For example, to make a presentation understandable, we should look at listeners expressively, speak with clear voice, and using easy English. The second, we need to making a good Power Point. It's maybe kind of thinking about listeners, but let's think about this as a different point because it is a big detail. Powerpoint should be attractive to get attention. So, in order to that, it would be better to keep in mind that we should use few keywords, use many pictures, and write notes if there are some difficult vocabulary. Thus it is important to think about listeners and make a Power Point for doing a good presentation in English.  I think what doing nice presentation need are eye-contact, clear voice and well-organized slides. First, we should take eye-contact in presentation, because taking eye-contact make listener more listen and I can grasp degree of understanding of listener. For example, we have to look partner's eye when we talk to someone. Second, we should speak clearly during presentation. If we speak low, listener cannot listen what we said and cannot understand contents of presentation. Finally, we should make well-organized slides used in presentation. We use as little words as possible and several pictures on slides. Such slides make listener understand more. In conclusion, I think taking eye-contact, speaking clearly and organizing slides well are very important for doing presentation.  I think being able to speak what to think is the most important thing. So I should expand my vocabulary and practice to pronunciation.  I think interesting theme is very important for good presentation. Because, to choose interesting theme is easier than to make progress English skills. So, to choose good theme is easy and important for us. After it, we should practice our English skills.  In my opinion, it is the most important to make listeners understand my own presentation, so we have to use simple words as much as possible and speak clearly. Of course we sometimes have to use difficult words according as I choice difficult subject matter, but we make efforts to convert difficult words into simple words flexibly. In order to speak clearly, we have to take a lot of time to practice our speech of presentation and memorize my draft of speech completely. In conclusion, we have to take a lot of time to complete our presentation.  I think organizing is important. The way of it is different from in Japanese to in English. Introduction have to be attractive and clear conclusion is usually said at first in English presentation. making eye contact and not looking your notes all the time, speak clearly not swaying back and forth like pendulum, and facial expressions are also important.  I think that it is the most important to make the main point which oneself wants to tell to a partner clear. This is why the contents become plain naturally because it is decided mainly on the main point by doing so it. In addition, I think that I come to strongly read the part which I want to tell more by being conscious of the main point I think that most important thing of presentation is the motivation to tell. Of cause, eye contacts, presentation and the volume of voice are important. But the motivation moves the listener's hearts and concentrates to listen.  presentations with fewer explanations are easier to understand, but It's not good to have little detail. Furthermore if it's too long to remember, It will cause that we can't catch listeners' reactions. Therefore, the balance is important. presentations in English are difficult for us to conduct, but much more difficult to understand. Then slides help us understand more, and pictures and figures are more powerful for listeners, so It's better to explain with dynamic slides with a little word. Of course, it's essential to memorize our presentation. If do so, we can speak with accents in important points and It will be better with eye contact.  I think the most important point in the presentation is ""simple"". It is important to be clear about what you want to convey, and explain it easy to understand. If you talking about too much, it is rather difficult to understand.  I think that it's important for presenter to speak clearly and make sure to tell what you want to tell to the listeners. It is not enough just speaking clearly. You need make sure that listeners understand what you said from their reaction or their faces. I learned this thing from my presentation.  I believe the most important point is eye contacts and some gestures, not passages we speak or pronunciation of the language. It is proved by the fact that the other day Japanese Tanaka Rie's speech of inviting the Olympics was very highly admired in the world. At the time I feel her English skill itself is not so good, but she smiled and made gestures all the time during the presentation. Maybe those elements are more important when we present to foreign people because they talk with their 'eyes', while Japanese often look at the paper on the desk during other's presentation.  I think the most important thing is ""simple"". The listener does not read if I write words for the slide too much. The listener will not hear all if I talk too much. Talking and writing have to be minimal. Steve Jobs did only minimum explanation as an expert of the presentation. And also important thing is ""voice"". We should speak loudly in a clear voice.  In my opinion, what is most important for a good presentation is giving your listeners eye contacts because they attract their attention and make you look confident. These two things is needed when you do a presentation. And I think speaking fluently is also needed because clear words make it easier to understand the contents than unclear ones.  I think the most important thing when we do presentation is to try to make eye-contact with listeners. Doing so, we can see their reaction, in other words, we can grasp whether they understand the topic of our presentation or not. If we do so, we can put the phrase they don't understand in simpler terms on the spot. But for doing so, we should prepare minutely and practice so hard. So we have to understand the details and main points in order to enable them to understand more easily.  The most important thing for doing a good presentation in English, I think, is explaining details simply. It is because it is always more difficult to listen to explanations than to read the passages. Especially when you give a presentation to non-native English speakers, you should try to use easy that everyone can understand. Last week, one of the students whom I sat by the same table with kept talking really fast in vague voice, though the classroom was very noisy. However, the next boy explained details in easy English, and I could know the main points precisely just by listening to his presentation and looking at slides.  I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that thinking what is importance for listeners. It is not until there are listeners that presentations are consisted. So speakers should think what is importance for listeners and tell its importance specifically. Therefore speakers have to devise vocabularies and expressions. They are not objects that itself expressing formal and simple.  First, I think we should research deeply, and we have to answer questions if I am questioned anything. If I can't answer the question, Listener will think I don't understand the contents. Second, we should be a good speaker of English. If I can't speak English very well, people have to concentrate to listen my English, so they will not understand the contents deeply. Finally, we should see the eyes of listener. It means that I talk them, so they can feel relieved.  I think it is important to explain slowly and to take eye contact in order to know whether a listener is understood or not. And, I feel that it helps understand to repeat an important point . If there are many words to hear for the first time , so explaining a term first is good way to help listener's understanding. Not to mention, it is important understanding contents well and talking by good pronunciation in a loud voice. However, I feel it is important to explain slowly carefully particularly when we give presentation in English .  I think the most important thing is eye contact in presentation. Communication makes our presentations clear. Without eye contact, our presentation would be boring. It is too difficult to use perfect English, but we should try to use English. Active motivation makes our presentations well-organized.  I think that speaking loudly and making eye contact are very important things for doing a good presentation in English. The most important purpose of presentations is communicating information to others. Without loud speaking and eye contact, you cannot communicate any information to them. However, most Japanese, including me, cannot do them well. So I need to get accustomed doing them.  The most important thing when we make a presentation is ""passion"" I thought. Needless to say English skill or eye contact are also necessary skills, but ""passion"" engages listener's attention more easily I think. So we should research a topic more carefully and make a presentation passionately.  To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. No matter how attractive the slides are, no matter how fluent I speak English, difficult story is difficult to understand itself. Well-ordered slides are also important to make a better presentation. It is not good to write too many words in a slide, but it is not good to write few words. Next time, I want to make a good presentation, keeping these points in mind.  After doing my presentation, I had a feeling that it was difficult to tell what I want to say. To do so, you have to speak easy English, face to the listener, have many pictures, and make contents brief and easy to understand. Especially, you have to put yourself in the listener's shoes. I think this is most important for good presentations.  I think that confidence is the most important at a presentation. It is because I can talk clearly if I have confidence. Moreover, it can talk and looking at a partner. If it practices so that I have confidence, I will regard a presentation as being memorized. I think that Making it grand with confidence considered.  I learned that it is difficult to make my speech without looking at the paper written what to say. But if I try to emphasize or make some gestures when I speak what I want to tell, it will become better presentation. In the last presentation's case, everyone made their speeches at the same time. It might made me forced to speak aloud from start to end. So next time, I want to challenge to make my speech in the silence situation.  I think that important points are eye contact and clear pronunciation in a presentation. Eye contact is the foundations of a presentation. I think that the eye contact can convey a feeling. I think that clear pronunciation is required in order to give information correctly. Unless the right information is transmitted, there is no meaning of a presentation. I think that people's attitude to hear is also important. A presenter's motivation will also be lost if an attitude is bad.  I think the most important thing for presentation is to speak clearly. When I listen to other's presentation, I sometimes can't listen the main point. It's because the voice is unclear. The purpose of presentation is inform listeners of information. Speaker should be conscious of speaking clearly and slowly.  The most important thing in a presentation is using easy words, I think. We cannot understand difficult English, so using easy words are required. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more conscience next time. Speaking in a loud voice is also very important. If presenter speak in a small voice, we cannot understand what he or she is saying. I have to practice more for the next presentation.  I think it is important for good presentation to guess if listeners can understand means of presentation. Of course, it's important to make a presentation which is easy to be understood, but to guess listeners' ideas are more important. But if we are crazy only to do presentations, we can't look at listeners and judge listeners' ideas. So we must look at listeners and we should make communications with listeners as possible as we can. So I can't look at the manuscripts and do presentation like speaking.  I think the attitude to convey our message to a listener is important for doing a good presentation. If we try to persuade a partner, we will prepare for a presentation before. Firstly, we should understand our news completely and memorize. Then, we need check that there is no words we don't know and whether we explain difficult words. Secondly, when we do a presentation, it is important that we speak clearly and look listener' s eyes. Listeners try listening carefully if we do that. In conclusion, if we have a mind try to do a good presentation, we can do it.  The most important things to give a good presentation are: speaking clearly, making eye-contacts, catching the audiences' interest. I think those 3 things are the key.  I think 2 things are the most important things to give a good presentation. First thing is ""attitude"". For example , trying not to see a memo , to tell simply enough to be understood by listener. Second is ""contents"" . However simple we give a presentation , it does not make sense if listener cannot understand the contents. So , contents are also important.  I think some points are important to make good presentation. Above all, The most important point is to think about listeners. We should take care of listeners so that they can understand our presentation better. For example, we should speak with loud voice and we should look at listeners eye.  In doing a presentation, I think what is most important is to get the listeners to understand what you want to say. In order to do that, you have to talk to the listeners and look at the listener's eyes, and care if they could understand you. And the speed you talk seems important to make one understand as well. Remembering the details of your speech will also help you to pay more attention to the listeners.  I learned two things for good presentation. The first point is to memorize the manuscript. It is important to do clear presentation because I can always see the listener and utter clear pronunciation. Second is to make the clear slide. The pictures and figures so much attached to the context make the listener understand the contents easily.  What is most important for doing good presentation is having confidence in my own presentation, I suppose. If I have no confidence, my voice is getting smaller and communications between me and listeners are getting difficult. I think it is also important to make it clear why I want to make listeners know the contents of my presentation. It helps me speech logically.  I learned 3 things from my presentation. To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. Second, confidence is important at a presentation. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more clearly next time and I want to do presentation better than this time.  I learned not only main points of each news but also how to do presentations. Presentation has to be clear and easy to understand for listeners. Slides also have to be clear, because it will be helpful to understand the contents of the news. I could know other teams were interested in what kind of news by this presentation. One of my group members chose a similar news with our teams', but I could learn the other main points of the news by him. I thought I would like to try to research more and to do a presentation from various viewpoints in the next time. "
JOC JOC-13B-09O 0.48 "I think washoku is wonderful culture and asset which Japan should be proud of. Now, Japanese officials are negotiating with other countries over TPP. I think Japan is not good at diplomatic negotiation. However, we have the great cultural heritage ""washoku"". In washoku, it is important to make use of materials and the climate of Japan and crops, livestock products and marine products which are raised in Japan. We have to show off the value of washoku and the importance of that crops, livestock products and marine products of Japan own are protected. Then, TPP negotiation and the economy may take a turn for the better by a brand power of washoku.  It's valuable and honorable that washoku was registered as the UNESCO heritage in 2013. I'm proud of many people eating washoku all over the world. Wherever we travel to, we can enjoy eating washoku. However, some of them are far from traditional Japanese cuisine. I think it is important to teach genuine washoku to foreign countries.  I'm a Japanese people, but I don't like Japan's traditional cuisine, known as ""washoku"", actually. I felt that it is wasteful not to understand merit of it. So I want to tell many charms of it to various people. In addition, I think it is good chance for Japan. Although western food is delicious, Japanese cuisine has other merit. We should protect it.  I was filled with pride on hearing of this news. Washoku's designation as an Intangible Cultural Asset is likely to have only positive impacts on Japanese people, society and economy. I think the fact that washoku has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list means we all Japanese pledged worldwide to inherit washoku. However, as the article says, it is true that washoku has been declining. It is Japanese that are responsible for succession of washoku. So, I want to contribute to that by learning the way to cook from my mother, not depending on fast food.  Probably, many Japanese people is proud of own culture. Needless to say, me too. But, I think Japanese culture is no longer seated Japanese living because of importation European culture. This news have potential to retrieve position what Japanese culture was.  I think Japanese people have to eat washoku more. If we don't eat them, we lose one of our tradition. So, I eat rice and miso soup every day.  I used to hesitate eating raw fish food, but when I took part in an international party, people from other countries strongly recommended me to try. From that time, I came to like Japanese cuisine. I'm so happy that Washoku is attractive to people all over the world and the fact UNESCO accepted it. I hope this will trigger to people who have a prejudice like me.  I think we can keep our health by eating Washoku. So, when I cook something, I always care about nutritional balance for my body. I consider that it lets to long life.  Now , people like to eat fast food. But fast food is not good to our health. Therefore , there are many people who are obesity. However , in contrast to fast food , ""washoku"" have merits of our body. So, I'm glad when I read this news. I hope that this matter lead good things.  I was happy to hear the news. I think Japanese food which is called ""washoku"" is the world's greatest cuisine. It is healthy and delicious. Although fast food is also tasty, it is bad for our health. When we eat fast food every day, it may lead to disease. We had better eat washoku every day for our body. I hope more and more people around the world to know about washoku and try to eat it.  I was glad to hear the news that ""washoku"" known as Japan's traditional cuisine had been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. I strongly think that Japanese love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" has a lot of seasonal foods. For example, ""JT002"" is a spring food, ""somen"" is a summer food, ""kurigohan"", in English ""marron rice"", is an autumn food and ""oden"" is a winter food. Therefore, we can feel four seasons a year, Japanese people are never tired of foods we eat. In conclusion, Japanese people love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" makes us notice four seasons.  In this year, we heard only happy news about UNESCO heritage status. Although, we has a problem with Korean. I hope the excitement cools down and UNESCO heritage status won't never sow the seeds of discord.  I am very happy to hear the news. I like Japanese cuisines and I want foreign countries people to know how good it is. Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy. I think it is rare characteristic of our foods I know many countries are interested in the Japanese food, but I did not expect ""washoku"" to gets UNESCO heritage status. Fast food is popular among young people. However, young people should care about their health. I hope that ""washoku"" are known as a healthy cuisine by this news in the world.  This summer, I went to the United Kingdom to study English. I was very surprised to find many Japanese food restaurants. In the United Kingdom, Japanese food is very famous and popular, especially for young women, because it is low in calories, good for health and delicious. However, Japanese food which was sold in the United Kingdom was far from ""true Japanese food "". It was difficult for me to explain what it was. It seemed like Japanese and Korean food. I think this situation happens all over the world. Of Course, I know there are some restaurants where sell ""true Japanese food"" in the world. I want many foreign people to know ""true Japanese food"" and know its wonderfulness, so I was happy to hear this news.  I agree with your opinion that Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy and it is rare characteristic of our foods. Many countries don't have seasonal changing, so we should proud of the fact. Japanese food reflect the advantage, so I also want many foreign people to know its wonderfulness. "
JOC JOC-13B-10O 0.83 "Nelson Mandela was not only a patient activist but also a great leader. Although he was caught in prison for a long times, he led and acted for human rights of non-white people. After his releasing from prison, He became the leader of ANC. He led ANC powerfully and he and ANC succeeded to extinguish the apartheid regime. ANC was a very large organization, but he led the very large organization well. ANC didn't succeed to extinguish the apartheid regime without a great leader like Nelson Mandela.  I remember I was very shocked when I heard the news. Nelson Mandela, I think, is one of the greatest leaders of the history. He fought with the apartheid regime with a strong will, saved a lot of black people abused, and changed South Africa. I respect him very much, and believe his achievements will be praised forever.  When I was a high school student, I studied world history and learned about him so I was very surprised to hear his death. I'm sure that he had strong will because he didn't give up getting rid of racial discrimination in prison and just the will have changed the world. I think his life told us how important the world peace is. I really hope that all the human can live equally, regardless of their race, religion, sex and flesh color. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  Because of his credits, I think Nelson Mandela is great. He tried to resolve racial discrimination, and he success to decrease it. I respect him very much, and think that we have to do anything to get rid of racial discrimination.  After 27 years, his concern was not revenge for his mistreatment. It is surprised, 27 years are so long that people ordinarily get angry about the mistreatment. In short, his concern which was making sure the country remind together was strong, so we must not make his will useless.  I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved.  There are a lot of discriminations all over the world, and apartheid is only one of them. I think Nelson Mandela is great person in that he is the first president fought against apartheid, but we must make sure there are a lot of problems about racism to solve.  I agree with your opinion. Nelson Mandela was the great leader. His act helped many people, so we have to take over his will and be great like him.  I think that Nelson Mandela is great person. He embodied with racial equality. We should learn his actions and thinking. I hope the world will be without discrimination.  Nelson Mandela is one of the most grateful politicians in 20 century. South Africa should keep his dream and appeals to world about prohibition of discrimination. Moreover, They should thanks to Nelson Mandela.  I think so. I respect Nelson Mandela very much. We should not lose freedom and equal. Then, we should banish racial discrimination.  I really respect Nelson Mandela. I strongly think his action was brave even he was put in jail for a while. He continued to try to make the society right and seems to be afraid of nothing. I believe his achievement will continue to be handed down forever in the world.  What Nelson Mandela have done to us and our society should be highly respected. His brave actions gave us hope. His wise and thoughtful actions showed us the right model of a human being. He will continue to be our respected figure and legend who will also continue to give us influences.  I think that your opinion is right. Nelson Mandela's great work should be praised, but this is just the trip of an iceberg. We have to try to solve that problems following him.  Nelson Mandela was a great person. The first time I knew his was during a lesson in junior high school, when my teacher let us watch a movie called ""Invictus"". This movie is about Mandela who became the first black president of South Africa, who tries to put together the country by reconstructing the rugby team. This movie shows the true story of how Mandela tried to put together the country, but the way he did this was fantastic. For example, he hired a white bodyguard besides him to symbolize the society getting better. I was impressed to how great this person was when I watched this movie, so I was really depressed when I first heard the news. I strongly believe that this person is one of the greatest person of human history, so I hope people would always remember him.  When I read this article I surprised that people who work for politics is desperate. This article says the candidate is stabbed while campaigning for politics. When I asked ""please imagine life-threatening work"", I imagine firefight, police-officer, security, military personnel and so on. But this time candidate is stabbed. My recognition is mistake. There are a lot of politician who killed somebody. For example Lincoln and Kennedy are. They are assassinated by somebody. It is common that they work for opportunity that life of national can be better than then. Lincoln worked hard for democracy and realized. Kennedy worked for the avoidance of Cuban Missile Crisis and save a lot of life not only American but also Cuban. Henrietee Reker worked for huge influx of asylum seekers from Syria to Germany. But she was stabbed. I know if huge asylum seekers come to in Germany, Germany economic; living environment and social security will be bad. But I know some country or somebody should save their life too. I believe her working is should be respect. It is natural and good to present many different thinking in the country. But it's not to be allowed to absolute that thinking appeal in violence. I respect her and it is reasonable to she is elected mayor. "
JOC JOC-14A-04N 0.77 "I have ever made vocabulary notes by using only Example 1. But I surprised to know that there were several kinds of example. I think Example 4 is the best way to remember words because a word is associated with other word, so I will be memorize them smoothly. Also, Example 2 is one of good ways that we rewrite it with other English words if there is a difficult word. We can improve our English expression skill considerably. I'm going to make cogitate vocabulary notes by referring to these examples.  I have been made my vocabulary notes like the first example and sometimes wrote stresses. But this way is laking to learn a language. When I read this article, I was interested in the second example and the third example. If I use the second example, I will use appropriate words instead of difficult words. If I use the third example, I will learn a lot of synonyms. So, I want to use these examples when I learn a language.  I have memorized English vocabulary by only using the first example, but sometimes, I felt that this is not efficient enough. By reading this article, I found the useful way that I want to use next time. Among five examples, I'm interested in the second example. By using the second example, I can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences and these are good for seeing how words work in real situations. From now, I would like to try this example when I study English! I have not made a vocabulary notebook until now. However, through this class, a vocabulary notebook had various forms and knew that there were a good point, a bad point each. I wanted to make a vocabulary notebook after having understood it. I think that English results might improve a little more if I make a word notebook in high school days. I want to learn the word in future without idling about.  I think the third example is best. I had been making the vocabulary notebooks as the first example until I read this topic. However, I knew that there are various kinds of vocabulary notebooks and I came to like the third example by reading it. Because the third example is categorized cleanly, easy to read and we can memorize many words which are connected mutually the same time. I think the first example is so simple and good when you study English vocabulary for the first time. The second example is too difficult for me because I'm not good at English very well and it is written in only English. The forth and fifth examples have too many words in them and difficult to read a little.  I have made a vocabulary notes like the first example. It is easy to make and to memorize a vocabulary. However, I think the third example is the best way to memorize. This is because it is written parts of speech and meaning in Japanese. Therefore, I understand the vocabulary easily. Besides, I think also the second example is a good vocabulary note. Understanding a English vocabulary in English is the most important to study English. however, it is difficult for people who is not good at English. I will try to use the note like the second example when I memorize vocabularies.  I use the first example of vocabulary notes all up until now. But, I think the third example is easy to remember. When I came up an unknown word, learn some related words at the same time. This is a rational approach! Then, I write some example sentence as well as words. I want to speak English fluently.  When I read this article, I reconsidered the way of making vocabulary notebooks. I have been studying English for a long time, however , I haven't thought about the role of vocabulary  notebooks or what should I do to make them more better to learn English. Therefore, I found this article very important for me and I thought I have to try not to forget the importance of vocabulary  notebooks. When I was a high school student, I didn't use the English-English  dictionary frequently, but this article made me find the importance of understanding the English meaning. The reason is that I think the English meaning is much better to understand the English words meanings than Japanese meaning. Furthermore, we can tell another people the real English words meanings in English. From such reasons, I think I will utilize the English-English  dictionary more often! I think the third example of vocabulary  note is best. When I was a high school student, I used the way of making vocabulary  note. because the way of writing made me read and understand the meaning and pronunciation and collocations. I have forgot the importance of device to make note more effective, so I will take note the by the way of writing.  I have made only the first example of vocabulary  notebooks, but this article taught the way of studying word to me. I think the third example is beneficial . It is efficient we learn related word at the same time, and pronunciation is very important to speak English. After this class, I felt I am not enough the amount of studying English word. So I want to study vocabulary  using these way.  I always use the first example of vocabulary notebooks. But, watching some examples of vocabulary notebooks, I felt that my consciousness changed. Because a vocabulary notebooks shown in the example than the vocabulary notebook which I used so far is relatively more useful. For instance, if I use the second vocabulary notebook, I can learn the meaning of various words at the same time. I make such a vocabulary notebook and want to raise one's command of English from now on.  I usually make vocabulary notebooks like the first example . The reason why I made it like the first example is it is so simple to see and easy to make it. Reading this article, I learned some ways of making vocabulary notebooks. And I learned the most important thing for me is whether I could master some words. I understand meanings of words , however, I cannot use the word well. In other words, I should change my vocabulary notebook style into new style which can be learned collocations to speak and write smoothly. Although it takes many time to make new vocabulary notebook, I don't care about it, if I come to speak and write smoothly. So I would like to try to make vocabulary notebook using a world maps. I'm glad to learn about many ways of vocabulary notebooks and each of these style's merits and demerits.  I have ever made vocabulary notes like the first example. I realized that this way seemed to be easy to remember, but it was not effective. No matter how I memorize only Japanese meanings, I cannot understand how to use the words in English. That's why my English skills do not make progress. So I would like to practice to make notes like the second example, because this way shows me example sentences and synonyms. I think this way helps me to understand deeply and to improve reading skills. From now, I try this way, and make efforts to be good at English.  When I learn vocabularies by heart, I make a notebook which I wrote English words in the right side and in the left Japanese meanings. Always I was bothered to memorize these words. These words which I learned by rote in this way were difficult to come up with. So always I was wondering which is the best way to memorize English vocabularies. Through this article, I understood that in order to master the English vocabularies there are some requisite points like synonyms, pronunciations, word maps and so on. Especially I am thinking that the most important part is example sentences. It is because it makes no sense if we cannot come up with the word which we want to express. From this time, I am thinking that I change my way to memorize the English words.  I think the second example is the best way to brush up our English skills. Example sentences give us a chance to infer the meaning of words. We can improve reading skills by inferring the meanings , I think. I used a vocabulary notebook which included various example sentences when I was a high school student and I was be able not only to remember a lot of English words but also to read English sentences smoothly later.  I thin the third example is best because we can read the note easily. The note tells us meanings of words, different forms of them and also pronunciations. This type of notes are seen in vocabulary textbooks we may have used when we studied for entrance exams. Those textbooks are easy to use for studying. However, I have made a note that is like the first example. My note can tell readers little things. I want to make my note have more information.  I often make a vocabulary note like the first example. But if I study English using that vocabulary note, I can not know how to use some English words and listen to them. So I want to make vocabulary notes like the second example. However it is the most important thing to study vocabulary notes over and over because we can not memorize English words just one time.  I think the third example of vocabulary notebooks is the best vocabulary notebook. It is because the third example is easy to see, and there are many information about words, for example, Japanese meanings, pronunciation and word families. You can learn many things about one word, if you use a vocabulary notebook like the third example. My vocabulary notebook is like the first example. It is easy to see, but there are only English words and Japanese meanings. So, I will change my vocabulary notebook like the third example.  I think the third example is the best, because I think ""a part of speech"" is very important elements when we read the foreign articles. We have to judge the word's part-of-speech in an instant if we would like to read them quickly and accurately. In addition, pronunciation is almost very important when speaking in foreign language. The third example includes these good points, so next time I make a vocabulary note, I will refer to it.  Vocabulary notebooks help us understand English words, so they should be easy to see and have a lot of information. To be specific, collocations, example sentences, and word families are important. Fourth example and final example include word maps. Word maps have a lot of information, but they look complicated. I think second example is a good vocabulary note book, because it is written in only English and we can grasp how to use words. I want to try to imitate second example.  I have never thought of the efficient vocabulary notebooks. When I study English words. I always use the first example because it is so easy that I save more time to remember the words instead of making vocabulary notebooks. However, from now, I want to adopt the second example. The second example is like an English-English dictionary. The good point of the vocabulary notebook is that we can improve the skill of explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill is useful especially when we have presentation. We are preparing English presentation now, so I want to make good use of the learning.  I have ever not contrived to make a vocabulary notebook. I have only written English words and Japanese meaning. This time, I could know many type of the way to remember English. I think number 3 is the best way. This is because the indispensable thing to study English word family, pronunciation, part of speech- is written in it. I am not a native speaker or returnee children. So above all, I have to remember correct spelling and understand right meaning. But, if I can skill up English skill, example 4 and 5 will be a valuable pattern because studying connection of words make text easy and deep.  I think the vocabulary notebook is very important because writing new words helps us to remember them. However I have never care about its style. My vocabulary notebook is similar to the first example, but I think example sentences should be written too now.  Making vocabulary notebooks has been my habit since I was a junior high school student. First I have written English on the left. Second, Japanese meanings, the word's pronunciation, accent, synonyms, English meanings and collocations. But my usual way is not clear at example sentences - when and how I should use the word. So I want to write example sentences, word family to grasp the word.  I wrote the things which should memorize it such as words since study for examination thoroughly and remembered it. Specifically, firstly I learn it by Japanese translation. I write in the investigation, an example sentence at a notebook with an English-English dictionary, and the illegible thing learns it by the Japanese translation next. I will continue in future and want to make an English study.  I have made my vocabulary notebooks like the first example, however, after reading this article, I noticed that it is not enough to learn how to use the word naturally. It is important to use the words naturally to speak like native speaker of English, so I will try to make my vocabulary notebooks like the forth example to improve my english speaking ability.  I have made the note like the first example. But it isn't often useful when I study new sentences written in English. Because an electronic dictionary is better than it every time. I think the third example is the best notebook of all. But it isn't worth making vocabulary notebooks. There're two reasons. first, they take you many times. Second, it's pretty hard to find the word you want to know in them. On the other hand, an electronic dictionary is easy to use and find. So I think they should be made so as to get self confidences and motivations if you make them for the reason, I'll agree with you.  I have made a vocabulary notes like example 1. It was most important for me to memorize as much words as possible when I was a high school student. However, what I am required to do as a university student is to convey my feelings to both native speakers and non-native speakers in English. Therefore, we should understand English by English, not Japanese. I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes.  Before reading this article , I had used only example 1. However, I realized more effective ways of talking vocabulary notebooks . In my opinion, we should use various ways of doing it , according to occasions. For example, if you want to improve your collocation skill, you had better use example4! I think that the vocabulary notebook is important for studying English. The vocabulary notebooks help me memorize Japanese meanings of English words. But I haven't thought about the way of making vocabulary notebooks. Now, my vocabulary notebook has only English words and Japanese meanings. I intend to take many collocations, word families in my vocabulary notebook from now on.  I think a memory tree is one of creative idea to memorize many words. I can memorize more words using colorful notebooks than a normal monotone notebook. I tried to make it rule to memorize words by a memory tree. But it didn't work very well. I want to make memory trees all the time I study.  Everyone thinks that the vocabulary notebook is necessary for studying foreign languages, but like the examples in the article, there are a lot of types of how to make vocabulary notebooks. If you adopt a wrong methods of making them, it would be not only inefficient, but also do harm than good, just like taking wrong medicine. As for me, the third examples is the best, because it is very easy to understand what the English words mean. On the other hand, the fourth and fifth example are bad. The style of word map is very messy for me, and the style is inefficient to learn words because it doesn't place the Japanese mean.  I have ever made a memory tree like an example 1 when I was in high school. But I think my memory tree was not detailed and difficult to find information. I think an example fourth is the best because there are a lot of information and every words are put in order, so it is the most useful memory tree. I will make effort to make good memory tree like an example forth.  To improve your English ability, I think second example is the best. I presume that the more you use foreign language, the faster you can learn. It is important for learners to actively use the language which they want to master. It is true that other ways to learn are also good, but , in my opinion, the second example is the best! I like second and third example. These are easier for me to understand what to write. The other is good to get a lot of information. However, it is more difficult to read all information immediately. So I like second and third example.  I think that the second example is the most effective in understanding English words and increasing vocabulary. If you want to read English smoothly, you should not ""translate"" it into Japanese. You should just practice ""reading English as it is"". The second example is very good in that it gives you plain definition and example sentences only in English. Without translation, you will be more familiar with English, which makes you better at using it.  I think that the Example 3 is the best notebook. It's because there are pronunciation and word families. When we memorize vocabulary, Example 3 is good notebook because we can know related matter at the same time. So I think Example 3 is the best notebook.  I think the second example is the best. Indeed, it is easy for us to understand the English words in Japanese. But vocabulary notebooks in English are more useful. Because we can remember more words and imagine the words. Therefore I think the second example is the best.  To ID14046 I have also used the first example and from now, I also want to adopt the second example!!!The second example is like an English-English dictionary. We can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences as you say. We are going to have English presentation today, so I will try explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill we have acquired by using the second example is now displayed! I agree with you! I use the second example of vocabulary notes until now. This time I know many kinds of vocabulary notes. So I'll reconsider the way of making vocabulary notes.  I have not regard making vocabulary notebooks as important doing, so I hardly did that. So I didn't know appropriate vocabulary notebooks. people around me have nice notebooks, and I found that it makes my memorizing English words easy, and this article introduce many examples, so I want to make my original vocabulary notebook.  I have made many vocabulary notes ever. But after read this blog, I have never made vocabulary notes that can be useful for except exams. From now on, I will try to make vocabulary notes like example second that is useful for not only exam but also real conversation.  I think simple is the best. Because efficient things are very beautiful and SIMPLE. I do not need any extra information, People do not often check the vocabulary notes so extra information makes me confused.  I tried to make word book by the second and third ways. However, it takes a quite long time. Recently, I have had a lot of English homework. I have not have enough time to collect words by these ways. Therefore, I have made my vocabulary note by the first way. I think that first of all, I need to make a more efficient plan about what I should do and to carry out my own plan.  I have not taking to make useful vocabulary notebooks into consideration. So, I found that making such notebooks make me so easy to learn not only English words but also collocations. In this article, I think forth example is particularly good. Because I often memorize only words that I read in something, but this article may help to give chances to get other words. I want to try to do it.  I use Example 2 because all english words give me skills to write or read. But, the practical way to master English is to learn parts of speech, pronunciation, word family and etc. Therefore, I decide to make an effective notebook which includes them.  I have made the vocabulary note when I was high school student. I have to memorize a lot of English vocabularies. So, I made it and read it during commuting time to school and free time. It is so useful because it makes me memorize this vocabulary meaning, pronunciation, part of speech and example sentence. I want to make vocabulary note again to pass English proficiency test.  I was convinced by this comment. I usually use the first example, but I will try to make a vocabulary notebook next time.  The simple is important, but not the best in the case of vocabulary notebooks. Extra information doesn't seem to confuse us because we usually look at only what we want to know. "
JOC JOC-15A-03N 0.38 "I have a lot of friends who are from Fukushima. When the terrible earthquake occurred they had many difficulty. I know the terror of nuclear power, and people who suffered losses by nuclear power. I won't see the damage of nuclear power. Certainly we can generate electricity efficiently by nuclear power, but we have another way to do it. I think we shouldn't use nuclear power because it has a bad influence.  I don't want the government to use nuclear plant to produce energy. There was nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2011. I felt scared to see the accident on TV, and I took pity on the people of Fukushima. In Japan, there are a lot of energy sources such as geothermal. I think it has no reason to use nuclear power absolutely. The government should think about not using the nuclear plant, and replace other energy.  Nuclear power is very risky but suddenly decreasing nuclear power is necessary good. It is because suddenly decreasing nuclear power increase burning power and increase greenhouse gas. Therefore not that nuclear power forcibly is changed into burning power but that nuclear power slowly be changed into natural energy is good way.  The FIT system is quite magnifique to encourage the use of green power source. We have to earnestly think about how we live with limited source. In recalling the tragedy in Fukushima, we should never make it happen again even accidentally.  Certainly, geothermal potential is huge and geothermal is cheap, reliable and works 24 hours a day. In addition, it's dangerous to use nuclear power. However, nuclear power the most economic. The price of electricity rise increasingly, so we are needy. Inventing renewable sources, first of all I think we should turn nuclear plans back on.  This is very stimulating story for us. In Japan, after Fukushima disaster, it is very animated at discussion of way of energy provision.  I think we have to search many way of energy provision because if it will be impossible to provide energy one way, we can cover it by another way. Dispersing risk is basic thinking of energy policy.  So, I think we must not throw away the technique of nuclear. Of course, we know about the risk of nuclear disaster, but at the same time, we have to think about if we lose all way to provide energy except nuclear, what we should do.  We experienced the tragic accident in Fukushima that costs much time and money to recover. It is extremely difficult to ensure the safety of nuclear power. So I oppose resuming nuclear power plant operations. However, if we abandon nuclear power, in actually, we may possibly suffer from a serious electric shortage in the near future. Consequently, I think what we should do is to economize on electric power and to develop renewable energy sources positively.  I think energy problems are very complicated. In Japan, we have reconsidered nuclear power's problems such as higher fuel bills and higher emissions since we experienced the Fukushima disaster. I don't support a return to nuclear power because it is the most important to ensure the safety of human lives. Following the Fukushima disaster, Japanese government has been pushing ahead with generating renewable power, but there are also some problems. I think cheap energy is important for me, but for the earth and Japan, it is important to improve green energy because there are limits of natural resources. I think we should reconsider the future renewable energy based on a hard look at what things will be like ten years from now.  I don't agree with the policy change by Shinzo Abe to turn the nuclear plants back on. Firstly, nuclear energy has bad and fatal points than good points. I know that nuclear energy has good points such as lower cost. However, nuclear energy has bad points such as radiation, radioactive waste. In addition, as we went through Fukushima disaster, we cannot restore environment completely. Then, people who lived in near nuclear plant cannot go back to their house. If we continue to use nuclear energy, same situation would happen. All in all, I believe that we should shift into energy that is safe and environmental. I hope safe and economical energy will be developed to replace nuclear and thermal energy in the near future.  I think Japan's government depend on a nuclear power plant too much. A nuclear power plant can generate many electricity. So it has many benefits. But it has also many risks. March, 2011, big earthquake occurred in the Tohoku district. Many people had to take refuge. Because, the nuclear power plant went up in a tremendous explosion. So we should stop to depend on it. We should use solar panels on own house and think a good way to produce many power.  It is difficult to spread electricity without nuclear power. But to think the Fukushima disaster, we can not use the power easily. If such a disaster happen again, Japan will have to spend enormous time and money for the solution to the problem. Japan has not utilized the power enough yet. So I think Japan should try to spread renewable energy. Therefore I think it is better to use renewable power than to use nuclear power.  I think that renewable energy is very good idea for protecting Japanese nature, so I think that Japan should use renewable energy. There are 3 merits of using renewable energy. First points is that renewable energy is good for environment. For example if a day proves right, the photovoltaic power generation is possible. The toxic substance does not appear. Second point is that resources do not disappear. Japan has few resource, so the securing of resources is important. Third point is that if Japan use renewable energy, it is not necessary to use nuclear power. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the nuclear power generation is dangerous. for reasons of above three, I think that Japan should use renewable energy.  I think that the study of renewable sources should be supported increasingly. Although Japan needs the cheap reliable power, we have to shut down nuclear power plants in the future. Preparing for that time, we must find the other effective ways to generate energy.  The Fukushima disaster in March 2011 influenced and changed not only Japan but also some countries, I think. We all realized the nuclear reactors' fear and Japan shut down all of them in Japan. It is still maintained, but I think that their restart is not so far. Surely, I don't want Japan to restart them because of our and our children's living on the earth. I claim that we shouldn't depend on the power of nuclear. The technology here is pretty developed so we must find better ways of making energy efficiently without nuclear reactors. Also, if selling electricity becomes more common, more the better ways will be found from its actions. Briefly, the expanding of solar system will solve the energy problem shortly, I think. I wish solar panels' prices will be lowered.  Turning the nuclear plants back on will be a big help for getting energy, but it is dangerous and risky. Recently, though we do not hear the news about the nuclear problems, we have to think about them seriously. It is a important problem for Japan.  I think that the return to nuclear power is risky because earthquakes increase recently in Japan. However, depending on thermal power generation is also bad for environment. The earth is not a thing only for Japan. It is desirable to use the renewable energy to the maximum. Now technology is developing every day. So, I believe that it is realized.  We tend to think that the way to keep Japanese electric supply is nothing but the return to nuclear power like Abe's argument. Also, the risk of nuclear power is forgotten recently . However, there are a lot of potential ways to generate renewable energy in Japan. So, I think that Japan should use not nuclear power but more reliable and cheaper power such as geothermal.  I agree with nuclear power generation for some reasons. It is true that some people say that as a nuclear disaster happened in Fukushima, nuclear power generation is dangerous. However, it is a man-made disaster and nuclear power itself is not dangerous. Japan has few natural resources and ways to use natural energy such as hydro, wind, tidal, solar and, geothermal, so Japan need to depend on nuclear power. Of course, the problem of radioactive waste must be considered. Meanwhile the way to use natural energy has to be improved.  I think Japanese government should switch around renewable energy from nuclear power. In fact, nuclear power plant accident cause serious problem in Fukushima. However, renewable power don't spread yet. So, Japanese government must spread renewable power in all of Japan.  After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult.  I think that an alternative energy source should be examined for its safety, efficiency and so on. Since Fukushima disaster happened, nuclear power generation became serious problem. In other words, before that people are not rejective for nuclear power generation. If nuclear power is managed properly, it should not be abolished. If an alternative energy source is introduced, government should reveal its safety.  I think the nuclear power is very useful. Nuclear power generation can be suppressed carbon emissions compared to thermal power generation. However, I think it is dangerous to rely on nuclear power, because the earthquake occurs many times in Japan. In 2011, an accident had happened at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. This accident resulted in extensive damage. So, we should know that the nuclear power is very useful, but if we mistake in how to use, it is very dangerous.  After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult. Present Japan exhausts a large quantity of CO2. This is very bad in environment. The global warming turns worse more if not improved.  A nuclear power has advantages that make much energy cheaply and easily. But also it has risks. We should not forget the nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2001. This accident frightened us. Disappearing radiation flowed in the sea and was blown by wind. So it brought damage in many areas and changed our lifestyle. Actually, my parents came to use Water Server to hear the news which many radiations were detected in the tap water. I think it is necessary to use renewable energy effectively. I hope the life which don't depend on nuclear power comes true some day.  I think nuclear power plants have to be shut down. Nuclear power is dangerous. Japanese government must think another power that can replace it. I think the best power is energy of ocean current, because Japan is islands and it is surrounded in the sea. To shutdown all nuclear power plants promptly is very difficult, but we have to keep thinking how shut down the plants.  The government should promote not nuclear power but renewable power, I think. Renewable energy has some advantages. First, they will contribute to conservation of the environment, because they don't discharge exhaust fumes and toxic substances. Second, if we make good use of renewable energy, natural resources won't be exhausted. However, there are also disadvantages. For example, it's difficult for renewable energy to secure of stable supply, and they will cost a great deal. So I think Japanese government need to give financial assistance and reconsider the location of renewable power plants. I hope that renewable energy will spread someday.  I have heard a Japanese proverb, "" Penny wise and pound foolish. "" It means that the people who want to buy one as cheap as possible is likely to fail in shopping. Just for Japanese government, it can be said the same thing. The government decided to push the burning lots instead of nuclear plant. I think this decision will be cause big problem such as promoting global warming or blackout that happen in whole area in Japan. Japan has various natural power for energy, especially, geothermal have big power. Of course, it required many time and labor, but the government should invest to such powers for the future.  When I was a high school student, I belonged to the newspaper club, so I have interviewed people who were from Fukushima. I realized that they tried to revive as hard as they could. I think what we should do is to know the present situation and think of the future in Fukushima. It is a true that Japan needs a lot of energy, but the most important thing is people's living safety and peacefully. The new energy comes into existence, however, there isn't enough it, so I think the government should provide the young with the opportunity that they could learn about the energy, disaster and future. I believe the young who are cultured may invent the sustainable energy in the near future.  I think that if we can spend life without nuclear power, it's the ideal future. But now, there is no option other than nuclear power that is cheap, stable supply. So I agree with the Abe government's argument that returns to nuclear power. In any case, a proper reason is necessary to choose energy option, because we take responsibility for explaining it for the next generation. What we have to do now is thinking about how to provide a structure of mix energy in a good balance and hoping there will be large output from renewable sources in the future.  I think that we should stop using the nuclear power. Because, it is too dangerous not only for us but also for people who will live in this world. Considering safety, we can not help doing it.  I think nuclear power is so dangerous, but we will use this energy forever. Because prior to the Fukushima disaster nearly 3NA per came from nuclear. we Japanese depend on nuclear power. But, we should generate electricity in other way. Fortunately, there are many ways in Japan. I think we should take advantage of geothermal power. Many volcano are Japanese feature. For example, Norway has many huge dams and a plentiful supply of water, so there are many hydroelectric power stations. Japan should imitate this case. There are many negative points to build a geothermal power plant, but we ought to utilize this way.  I think nuclear power is dangerous, but we should restart nuclear power plant. Japan will develop more and more in the future. We will reach the time that other energy can't provide Japanese society with electricity. No one have absolute safe way. We must be ready to choose a little dangerous way. This opinion applies to other field, for example, politics, economy and etc.  I think that Japan should increase the supply of renewable energy. The generation of electricity by nuclear power is certainly efficient. However, from now on, it is very important to promote the use of renewable energy in consideration of safety. We must not forget the tragedy of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011.  In terms of safety, shutting down all nuclear power plants is the best way. However, if we do so, we can't get sufficient energy continuously. After all, we must develop technology to generate electricity more stable than what it is, I think.  I would like to know why Prime Minister Abe supports nuclear power so strongly. I have never heard of people positive about nuclear plants around me. At the same time, I wonder whether there are any problems with geothermal power suggested in the article. I believe Iceland, famous for the great hot spring called Blue Lagoon, exploits geothermal well. In Japan, there are some hot springs depending on geothermal as well, but it is not utilized to maintain our lives. I hope the idea of renewables will spread more.  I think that the nuclear power is not reliable power, so I disagree the return to the nuclear power. Indeed, the nuclear power is the cheap big power. The point is fabulous. However, the people who live in Japan have threat of the nuclear accident. Therefore, I conclude that we should not make the nuclear power return.  I think that nuclear power is a good way to generating electricity, but it is too dangerous. It can supply large amounts of electricity stably, but after the Fukushima disaster, not only Japanese but also the people in all over the world are afraid of danger of the nuclear power. I think nuclear power is no longer the best way to supply electricity.  I believe the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies should try to invent ultimate renewable energy producing system. At first, ultimate renewable energy producing system contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies can earn big money. Environmental problems, especially global warming, are controversial in modern society. When they invent it, they can sell their technology to other countries. In conclusion, in order to contribute to stop global warming and promote the national interest, they invent ultimate renewable energy producing system.  I agree with using the nuclear power . I know that nuclear energy has good points for example low cost and good for global warming . However, nuclear energy has bad points. For example danger for us. I concorded that points and I prefer before one because Japan desn't have a lot of money. So I decided that I don't support the return to nuclear power. Although we can cheap and reliable power by the nuclear, it's very hazardous. Nevertheless, we have not been able to deal with spent nuclear fuels. And now, many anti-nuclear power plant movements are held not only in Japan but all around the world. So, Japan should develop the new ways of power generation right away.  I think that to use nuclear power is good way to generate electricity, but it is too dangerous to keep for people of the world. And there are many energy sources in Japan, so we should to replace other energy.  When I read this article, I was surprised to know there are many ways to generate energy in Japan. So, nuclear power in Japan should be banned because there are many earthquakes in Japan, so nuclear power is too dangerous. From this reason, I think Japan should use alternative way to nuclear power.  I don't support to return the nuclear plants back on. That is because even if the nuclear power is able to generate the much electricity at one time than other power generations, it is so dangerous that I cannot believe it do no harm to people. Certainly, other power generations without the nuclear leave much room for improvement. But we should think of the priority of safety.  Certainly, nuclear power is dangerous if we use it in an improper way, and I know the Fukushima disaster was a terrible one. However, considering the current situation in Japanese energy consumption, I think whether we can stop making use of nuclear power or not can only be guessed at. This is a difficult problem.  Nuclear power is very useful. It don't discharge CO2 and generate a lot of energy. Administration think it is an ideal generation for Japan which has hardly resource. However, we should recognize risk of nuclear power and Japanese resource. Japan has a lot of nature and many hot spots. these will become hydropower and geothermal power.  I think Japan has to continue to do without nuclear power. This is because, today, Japan has been suffering from radioactivity. And now, Japan has been coping surprisingly well without nuclear power, so we don't have to use it intentionally.  I think Nuclear power generation is very important for Japan now. This is because why I think like that is we cost much money and labor for generation. We can make power from Nuclear and it cost few amounts of money. Certainly if An accident happens of Nuclear power plant it must be Crisis for the human. Therefore human should more study about Nuclear and control it.  I don't agree with Abe's plan to Turn the nuclear plants back on. Of course it is difficult to produce enough electricity for us to live without nuclear. however seeing the tragedy of Fukushima, we should think about the danger. also Japan has a lot of renewable energy sources. We should use these sources.  Certainly, nuclear power is very useful. But we have to decrease it to protect human beings. The nuclear power can generate the energy easily . In this aspect, it is very good. But if the incident happens, for example Fukushima disaster, we can not do anything. So I think we must stop using nuclear power plant.  I think that nuclear power plant must be shut down. Of course, without nuclear power plant, governments could not supply electricity adequately. However, if governments build sustainable power plant while they shutdown nuclear power plant step by step, they could supply power sufficiently.  I think Japanese government should decide to make use of more geothermal power generations. Certainly, the nuclear power produce a good deal of energy cheaper than other renewable energy. However, we must have the risk of radiation accidents at the same time. On the other hand, Japanese people have been suffered from eruptions for a long time and there are many volcanoes in Japan. If we are able to make use of them efficiently, which will be Japanese strong point of making electricity and help us have comfortable life The Abe government said that nuclear power was better than other power generation from the financial viewpoint, but I don't think so. Even if earthquake isn't occurred and don't cause nuclear power accident, it has been always had problem of hazardous chemical substances. The disposal of the waste needs technical way and there is few place that allow to bury these risky substances. Therefore I think nuclear power plant will actually make Japan's finance worse.  I don't think we should be using nuclear power anymore, because It's obviously not good for environment and we haven't found the way we coop with those things after we used them. And as the articles says, we have lots of potential ways to generate renewable energy so we should make most of them. We should be responsible for not only us but also next generations.  I think that it is not excusable to use nuclear power in Japan. The safer nuclear power is the desirable. However, it is accompanied by high risks and this is well known to us. That is why the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 was the greatest disaster Japan had ever experienced. We must never cause such the Fukushima disaster. But practically, today Japan's big power companies are faced with major risks and challenges. They should maintain a nuclear phase-out policy and promote the introduction of renewable energy more readily and willingly.  I think nuclear plants are very dangerous, and restarting them is so scaring. Many people are suffered from radioactive and died of it. Even if nuclear power is effective energy source, I oppose running it. I hope more alternative energy appear in the near future.  Nuclear power is very useful. But I think we should not too much rely on this power. Conversely, we should use this power to some extent for stable providing power. Of course, it I must be thought for risk and trouble. I think Japan should search for good balance to using balance between nuclear power and other safety energy.  I know the damage of the Fukushima disaster is very terrible. For example, radioactive pollution and involving damage caused by a rumor is also big problem. Not only Japanese people, but also foreigners around the world were influenced and avoided Fukushima's food at that time or now on. However, I support a return to nuclear power plants. That's because the cost of thermal power generation oppresses Japan's finance. Besides, I think, the safety revel of nuclear power plant is being developed and terrible disasters are more controlled. But I also think, much renewable power which are ecological and a low cost will be used is the best.  If the data in this article is all correct, I can't understand the intention of government. Everyone want to safety. We just need to use geothermal which is beneath us.  I think indeed unclear is need our life. But we should use to replace unclear energy.  Many of Japanese people have thought that the nuclear power is so dangerous and it gives them the only bad influences since 2011. However, I think we cannot say that it is absolutely bad, because the Japanese people relied to be supplied with electric power by the nuclear power, so we could use electricity. In addition, I am from Tohoku, and I heard many opinions about the nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. A half of them disagreed with a claim that all nuclear power stations should stop running.  The Fukushima disaster reminds us of a risk of nuclear power. We depend on this power very much. The nuclear power is very dangerous. So, we cannot use it eternally. But, there is no energy to replace nuclear power absolutely. Now we cannot use the natural power as a substitution of the nuclear power. The Japanese government should find strong natural powers immediately. And we should have interest of this problems more.  I felt nuclear power was dangerous and threatened people when the Fukushima disaster happened. And I think renewables to make energy of Japan are safer and reliable, so Japan should prevail them more by using efficient ways.  Losing control of nuclear power caused the Fukushima's secondary disaster, so Japanese people think about renewables more. Certainly, there are many people who object to nuclear power, but Japanese government cannot help using it because other means are ineffective. We should consider whether nuclear power is really effective or not for Japanese people.  I want Japanese government to be more think Japanese economic perspectives. We Japanese need grow our economic first. So, it seems that nuclear power is dangerous, we can't help but use it. I am one of the person who is suffer from nuclear radiation. In fact, people don't worry about it so much. Children play around outside. They have time limits though just in case. I want people who are from Futaba, Soma, and so on, go back their home, but Japan has to increase our economic development first.  I think that nuclear power is so risky and we must be careful when we use it. The accident was caused in Fukushima in 2011. I felt so scared when I heard about the news through TV newses. Japan has other ways to create energy except nuclear power, so I want Japanese government to use safe ways.  I think nuclear power shouldn't be used in Japan because of Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the accident, many people were scared by threat of nuclear. There are a lot of ways to make electricity. Safety way must be practiced. In other words, anyone must not threatened by power generation. I hope that good way of power generate will spread all over the world.  I think that renewable energy is useful, but it may take many years for us to use renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. For example, geothermal power plant needs much money and extensive lands. Also, most of the plant is made by our national government, so the cost to made it is covered by our tax. Renewable power revolution is important, however, I think there ara lot of problems for the power.  I think that the government shouldn't use nuclear power to produce energy because nuclear power is so risky. When I saw the nuclear accident in Fukushima, I felt the timing that we had to stop using nuclear power came. There are many kinds of natural powers to produce energy in Japan. We should utilize the each power, thinking about the merit or demerit of each natural power.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should find new power energy too, but these energies are limited. Considering nuclear power's merit, we have to solve this difficult problem .  Your suggestion about alternative energy is great. I thought that nuclear power generation should not be abolished, because alternative energy is not yet established. If a study on energy of ocean current advances, the nuclear power generation is not necessary. I hope the day when energy of ocean will come to lead the generation of Japan.  I agree with your opinion. After Fukushima disaster, all people afraid of nuclear power. So, I think from now on we use renewable energy.  Certainly the nuclear disaster in Fukushima was very pathetic, but nuclear power is very attractive for Japan. Since Japan has few natural resources, nuclear power energy is necessary. And nuclear power gives Japan a chance for having nuclear weapons. Today China is threating neighboring countries, so Japan need to reinforce the self-defense capacity. The issue of developing nuclear weapons should be worth discussing more .  I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government think only today's coping method, and they cannot make effort to improve energy system.  I thought that nuclear power should not be used when I read this article. but I knew that I could not say like that easily because Japan didn't have enormous energy instead of nuclear power.  I agree with your opinion that we should stop to depend on nuclear power and think a good way to produce much electricity. Producing much electricity only by solar power is difficult. And depending on one energy is dangerous. So, we have to use many kinds of power. We should think many good ways of producing electricity.  Nuclear energy is certainly efficient source that provides a great amount of energy constantly. But it is essential to take into consideration its danger. In fact, safety myth the government argued is out. We must pay attention to both positive and negative side of this energy.  I agree with your opinion because I also think Japanese should know nuclear power has a danger. To realize our opinion, we should be interested in the problem about Japanese energy and make efforts to gain exact information.  I agree with your opinion. Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms. We must not forget the memory of 3.11 and always pay attention to the news about nuclear power, getting information on our own initiative.  I agree with your opinion. The problem of the disposal of waste is serious.  I agree to operate a nuclear power plant again. It is because the cost of the atomic energy import is cheaper than oil and gas for thermal power generation. In addition, Japan may fall into electricity shortage without nuclear power generation.  I agree with you. Nuclear power reminds us of Fukushima's disaster, and it gives fear to people. As the article said, I think that geothermal power is good because it use natural power and is much safer than nuclear power.  I think nuclear power is dangerous. In Fukushima, so many people were scared by threat of nuclear power. So we must be used safety power. For example, geothermal and so on. Now, Japan should develop that make other safety power.  I tend to agree. Because I think nuclear power is dangerous. In Fukushima, so many people were scared by threat of nuclear power. So we must be used safety power. For example, geothermal and so on. Now, Japan should develop that make other safety power.  I agree with your thought. The nuclear power is very dangerous. We use safety power. But, if we use only safety power -geothermal power without using nuclear power, we will run short of power. So this problem is very difficult.  I have a same idea. When I first understood the Fukushima disaster, I felt scary and Japan should stop using nuclear power because there're many risks. We should think future power deeply.  I think so too. There are a lot of nuclear reactor in Japan, but nuclear power is dangerous. So I think Japan should use another power. This problem is not somebody else's problem but our problem, so we have to think deeply.  I agree with your idea. Japan experienced the Fukushima disaster and reconsidered nuclear power's risk. We have to discuss which energy we use in the future deeply.  I think so, too. Japan has constitution article 9. It is our constitution core. We should maintain this article.  I think so too. The fact that there are a lot of nuclear power plants is so threatened people especially who live near them. So Japan have to find renewables I agree with your opinion. Certainly there are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.  I agree with your thought about renewable power, but there is a lot of problem to spread these power. So, I think the government should do the best to improve renewable power, but it is not done mind that this achievement become a little slowly.  I tend to agree. There are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.  Fukushima disaster. I live in Saitama, but I experienced such big earthquake for the first time. It isn't an earthquake that much damage was taken out certainly, by nuclear power generation. However, Japan has a little energy resource. Japan needs the power of the nuclear power generation to do the former cultural life.  I think so too. Japan needs using nuclear power. I believe the government will be forced to be available to the power.  I agree with your opinion. I don't want Japan to depend on nuclear power. I think it is scary because of the accident in Fukushima. Many people in Japan may also think about it. The government has to look for another way which can produce as many powers as nuclear plant.  I can't forget the accident happened in Fukushima 2011. This year, many people injured and scared the fear of the nuclear power and some people suffering now. I knew the real danger of the nuclear power then. I think Japan should not use the nuclear power. There are many different ways to make electricity. The compatible of both of the safety and efficiency is difficult but we never bring such misery accidents 2011 in Japan. We would like to believe the government.  I think solving energy problems is difficult for us, but we must solve the problem. I think we depend on nuclear energy temporary, but we should replace the power on renewable energy. It is hard way but we must do.  I think so. Nuclear plans are cheaper than thermal plans. And they discharge lower carbon dioxide than thermal plans, but it's very very dangerous to use them. So we invent renewable energy as soon as possible.  I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government has to focus on the development of renewable energy more positively. In addition, at the same time, I think what we should do first is the saving of electricity.  There are two things that we have to think. First, many renewable energy resources cost very high. Its already very high in Japan and introduction of renewable energy bumps it. We are in dramatic competitive world. In much countries, electricity expense is lower than Japan. Especially, North Korea and US cost half as Japan. Second, nuclear technology is one of the highest technology now, and Japan has it. It's reasonable opinion that nuclear energy is dangerous, but it's not a smart way that stop and throw the nuclear energy. I think, Japan has to two things. First, developing good renewable energy cost reasonable price lower than thermal power plant. Second, developing safe nuclear energy.  I don't think so. First, we can't build many geothermal energy plant in Japan because most of places where can build geothermal energy plant are in national parks. Second, nuclear technology is very valuable and stopping development costs high.  I think your opinion doesn't reasonable. We can't stop spreading nuclear energy in the world. The number of Nuclear energy plants will increase 0.5 compare than 2011 (from IEA, 2012). Many of new plants will place in developing country. They really want to low cost energy resource and nuclear energy is almost only way to fill their demand. It's not a smart way that doing campaign to stop building nuclear energy. We have to develop safe nuclear energy as far as possible and build it on developing countries, first. And, at a time, we develop energy resources cost lower and lower. We have to do both of them.  I agree with you. We have to stop using the nuclear power little by little. In order to that, we should consider about it more carefully.  I'm all for your opinion. Surely, Japan has few resources, so if we can use renewable energy, the problem of electricity will be solved. And, nuclear power will be abolished completely.  I think renewable energy is very important. It is safety for environment, and natural resources are not used. And also, by using it, nuclear power will be abolished completely. However, using it costs more money than usual. Solving the problem of electricity is not very easy.  I agree with you. Now, it may be necessary for us to use nuclear power, but we should think about the way that we don't have to use it.  I think so, too. We cannot but cover electricity with nuclear power generation until a convincing alternative energy to turn into nuclear is developed.  I mostly agree with your opinion, but all nuclear power shouldn't be shut at the same time. To be sure, it's possible to stop the some of all. In my opinion, we are good enough developing stable and ecological power when some of all plants is shut.  I agree with you. Japan rely the nuclear power and it is rational.  I agree with you. I think increase of earthquakes make returning nuclear power more risky and make Japanese anxious too. Not only developer or government also we think about renewable energy.  I agree. Nuclear power risks too much for us. Through Fukushima disaster, we grasped the fact that nuclear power generate might cause very dangerous accident. Japanese people have no reasons to persist only nuclear.  I agree with you. Even if the nuclear power plant supply electricity cheaply, we shouldn't use it because we cannot quite control it with current technology. As you say, the price people in Fukushima paid in Fukushima disaster was too big. Japan should change the way to generate electricity for environment and ourselves.  I think so, too. Japan should change the way to generate electricity because we don't have enough technology to use safely nuclear power at present. I hope our life that don't count on atomic power comes true some day! I think your idea is best way. We must renounce nuclear power in accountance for Fukushima tragedy. But Now, Nuclear power accounts for 0.2 in Japanese electricity and Japan can't renounce nuclear power if future is like now. Therefore Japan must invent new energy.  Before I read this comment, I thought Japan should promote renewable power but I didn't think about How to promote renewable power. Therefore Your comment show me how to promote renewable power.  I don't think so. After Fukushima disaster, We can live without nuclear power. In Germany, 25% of all electricity is generated by renewable energy. After Fukushima disaster, German Government stopped about half of nuclear power station. And succeed in a revolution of generation. Japan should reform it now, too.  I partly agree with your opinion. Indeed, nuclear power is terrible energy but if nuclear power generation is abolished, are there enough alternative energies. Unless alternative energies are invented, we cannot help but rely on nuclear power.  I agree with your opinion. Indeed nuclear power plant is very efficient to produce energy. It does not emit co2 so the plant is very environmental friendly. But we have to think about the dangerous. So I think the nuclear power plant have to be decreased.  I think we should think the way to produce enough power. However I think solar power is so weak that it can't make up with the nuclear power. .  I cannot agree with your opinion. To be sure, Fukushima disaster was so terrible, but considering the fact that the population of Japan is very large but we have few resources, using nuclear power for electricity cannot be avoid. However, it is a different story that we have the nuclear weapons. To begin with, Japan promised the constitution to use nuclear power peacefully, in other word, Japan must not use this power as weapon. For this reason, I cannot agree with your opinion entirely.  I'm for your opinion. I believe it is essential for us to spread renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. Also, the Japanese government must try to popularize renewable energy. the Japanese government has to set up infrastructure in order to use renewable energy in reasonable price for the next generation.  I think so too. Renewable power is good for the earth, but it cost a lot of money to make many power bases. But we have responsibility that was have to save other animal, because we have broken the earth already. So it have to become truth immediately. I know it not easy.  Renewable energy will be more demanded in the future. This is because it is more safety for environment and nature.  I think this article is good and very useful, too. The article say present of renewable energy and future of. It have classification of power generation methods. Based on this article, the dispute about unclear power will become revitalize and easy to understand.  I partly agree with your opinion . Though it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous , the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So , I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered.  I don't know for sure if your idea is correct, but it is true only geothermal power doesn't meet electronic needs.  I think so too. Improving green energy is becoming important for Japan, because we knew the risk of the nuclear power by the Fukushima's accident and we were realized again the finitude of natural resources. We have to find other safer and more stable ways of electricity supply for the environment in the future.  I think this Abe's policy make a emotional dependence on nuclear energy. Japan has experienced many troubles related nuclear energy. This is the time to part from this dangerous thing like Germany.  Nowadays, one of the biggest if not the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing is global warming. Therefore, Japan, third biggest country in terms of economy, have to be a leader solving this problem.  It is no doubt that the Fukushima nuclear disaster is one of the most disastrous incident which ever happened in Japan. I felt the feeling of both sadness and anger at the same time. I felt the anger towards the powerlessness of the government and myself. I is important to take actions, not become a bystander.  The nuclear problem is one of the biggest problem we, the human beings, are right now facing. The dilemma between high energy efficiency and safety risk which make us puzzle about what should we do. It is very difficult to select one in this case. More debate and discussion are needed in the future.  The biggest problem of nuclear energy is its safety risks. Nuclear energy has not yet proven its safety to people. This is why there are counterforce which has grown and became a big group right now in Japan and all around the world. How to overcome the risks of safety is never-ending assignment for nuclear energy.  Japan, third biggest country in economic way, has a responsibility of solving the world's common problem. Nowadays, one of the biggest problem in the world is environmental problem. Global warming has been spotlight for many years now in 21st century. Some countries came up with an idea of using nuclear energy which produces little amount of pollution with high energy efficiency. However, things always contains both positive and negative sides.  People discuss about running unclear power generation but there is more important thing. It is to use renewable energy effectively. Renewable energy is good for environment and has possible. So, Japan should focus on renewable energy.  This news was shocking to me because Japan is believed to be a one of the best country with the technology of renewable energy.  As a country which experienced disastrous nuclear plant accident, Japan should use this experience to make a wise decision. I cannot say whether banning nuclear plant is good or bad for Japan right now but I can say that this decision should be made carefully. Moreover, Japan will change drastically when the decision is made.  I always wonder why nuclear plants are so huge in the size. I am sure that when the size has increased, the safety risk will increase too. Therefore, sizing down the nuclear plants can increase the safety of itself. If it is possible to down size the nuclear plants, at least some of the anti-nuclear groups will admit to compromise.  When I read this article, I think it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous, but the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So, I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered.  Certainly what you said is the right thing, but I think Japan cannot produce a lot of energy without nuclear power. I believe the cause of the nuclear accident is lack of preparations for big earthquakes and tsunami. The nuclear power generation is still necessary for Japan. I think Japanese government should make the best to find a solution.  I think nuclear power is very attractive for Japan, too. We have to find alternative energy power I think that the nuclear energy has merits and demerits. The quantity of its producing energy is large, but if it goes wrong , it will become a menace to Japan. In these days, potatos can be the energy like electricity, so it is good way to look for another technique of generating energy.  I think that nuclear energy is essential for Japan. Because we don't have the source of energy . We dosen't live without nuclear energy.  I THINK SO TOO. WE ARE SAID TO BE SAFE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IT BECAMES CLEAR THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY WAS danger. IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING TO ME.  I understand your opinion. We must get out of a paradox situation where people are dependent on nuclear power while nobody wants it in your neighborhood. But I wonder if it is possible because we do not know who and how it will be done. Japanese people have to think about this issue more.  I agree with your idea. Japan should solve this problem not only because nuclear power is dangerous and connote high risk but because Japan as developed country should be reader for environmental problem because of Fukushima accident. I think that government should show the world environment-friendly Japan.  I agree with you. I think Japan should depend on natural powers more.  I was also scared to see the accident on TV and I agree with you. Japan should not generate electricity by nuclear power.  I disagree with you because the nuclear power is too risky.  I think also that the nuclear power has merits and demerits, however I think the power has more demerits than merits. Japan should not have the nuclear power.  I think so, too. We should overcome this weak points. In these days , potatoes can be the resource of the energy like electricity.  I think so too. We have to live with nuclear energy. We should learn the useful and safety way of using nuclear power.  I tend to disagree with your opinion. Because nuclear power is so dangerous. So people living where near the atomic power planet , they were under threatened.  I am one of the person who is suffer from nuclear radiation. In fact, people don't worry about it so much. Children play around outside. They have time limits though just in case. I want people who are from Futaba, Soma, and so on, go back their home, but Japan has to increase our economic development first.  I tend to agree with your comments. The Japanese energy problem are serious. We should find the big energy which turns early in a nuclear power I agree with you. The Fukushima disaster made us good opportunity to think carefully about the energy and our safety. As you mentioned above, there is limit of natural resources, so we had better to use green energy.  I think unclear power is terrible. But people who lived there really is difficult life . Unclear power has a bad influence. Japan should not use it.  I want to improve Japanese technology. However, I am worried about this improvement is too sharp.  I understand your opinion. I think so too your opinion and nuclear power is decreased slowly.  Even the nuclear plants make huge amount of energy, I want to keep is shut down. Because there is one nuclear plant near from my hometown. Some people say that we can't live without nuclear power but I don't think so. I think there are many ways to produce energies and Japanese have potential to find some new ways because Japanese are very cleaver.  I didn't know that potatoes could be energy. That will be the great way because it will not emit harmful gas or something bad for human being. This method might be used in the US, however, I don't think we have much potato in Japan to generate enough energy. But I think this kind of way to make energy is useful. "
JOC JOC-15A-08N 0.58 "I think bill gates is so nice a person because he invests a lot of money in charity. And it is surprising that we have to keep two-thirds and four-fifths of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground if the world is to remain within a 2C rise in global temperatures.  Climate change maybe is the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing right now in 21st century. People like Bill Gates who have impact on the world should step up and be the leader. Of course we also have to take responsibility and make the world safe for our future generations.  I think fusion reactor is one of the future energy resource. Fusion reactor is very deferent from nuclear energy. It use Hydrogen, not Uranium or Plutonium. It put little radioactive waste. It doesn't melt down. I mean, it's so safely. Current technology can't make it, but I hope we will use it someday.  Photovoltaic power generation, wind-generated electricity have big possibilities. However, these cannot supply energy continuously. The progress in the field of energy is required for economic overall expansion. However, there are three important problems that must be settled. It is cost, stability, and influence on environment. Such a point will have to be solved.  I think so, too. Bill Gates says, ""I choose the latter if I can realize either choosing ten future Presidents or securing the energy that is eco-friendly, and has low cost"". From this, I can know that he has good personality and understand how he regards an energy problem as important.  I think that it is wonderful news and Bill Gates is very good person. Resources are limited. For example, coal is left only for 150 years and petroleum is left only for 40 years. Therefore resource is very important. Renewable energy is wonderful invention, so we should make good use of it. If this news spread all over the world, everyone think about renewable energy, so the behavior of Bill is important for the world. I strongly believe that renewable energy should be utilized.  I think that renewable energy has some problems, too. Firstly, setting up the machine of renewable energy is very high cost. Therefore there is a possibility that electricity's cost becomes high. Secondly renewable energy is very instability. There are also a day when we have no sunlight and a day when the wind doesn't blow. These days, we cannot secure electricity. Finally, there is a possibility which occurs of influence on environment. Therefore I agree with you and I think your opinion is great.  As Bill Gates mentioned, the current climate change situation is irreversible, and I believe that there should be more investment on renewable energy. Renewable energy, compared to energy derived from fossil fuels are more accessible and has more potential. Therefore, Gates' decision may end successfully.  Bill Gates should be respectable except his business. Investing a lot of money in renewable energy business is surprising and worthy of promoting. I wish the rich did it like Bill Gates in Japan. Now Japan need new clean energy not nuclear.  You are wonderful to list the example of green energy. Certainly, there are a lot of problems on renewable energy. We must reconsider Japan's electric situations. Whether nuclear energy is good or bad seems to be a fruitless discussion.  I respect Bill Gates and his action because he invest in renewables even though it is high-risk. I think his action will be a good chance which we think about global environment.  Bill Gates is respectable person. He do action which other people cannot do. It is unusual to invest $2BN for renewable energy project. His action will make people think renewable energy again.  Bill Gates is the most rich all over the world. He created Windows and Microsoft corporation. However I don't think this only point make him grate. His other grate point is to contribute a lot of things to society like this article.  I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable.  I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable.  I think so. I think it's role for influential people to announce global problem like environmental issue, but we must consider this problem, too.  I think it is interesting that Bill Gates invest in green energy technology and research to combat climate change, just for economic benefits. It means coming of the new era when good for environment is good for economic.  Some people may say that supported by capitals such as Bill Gates to solve the energy problem shouldn't be allowed to fear they will monopolize energy business. However, I think such people ""should"" invest this business because energy, environmental problem is very serious and we must solve it immediately. "
JOC JOC-15A-09N 0.61 "I don't know advancing the construction of a new US base by the governments of Japan and the United States is right or not. If it is not right, we have to prevent Japan from moving in the wrong direction. As Kenzaburo Oe believes and Yoichi Higuchi says, we should believe citizens protesting and support them.  I believe that the governments of Japan and the United States should not advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. First of all, there are many people who oppose to build new base at Henoko. Japanese government should listen to their voices. Additionally, nature and ecology of the sea at Henoko would be destroyed by building new base. All in all, we have to oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. We should not only talk but also take actions to protect land and people of Okinawa.  I oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko because Japanese government ignore the voices of people in Okinawa. We should take actions to prevent building new base.  I can't agree with the construction of a new US base in the Henoko district. Because it may lead to destruction of the environment. Beautiful sea which various kinds of sea creatures live in should be protected. Moreover, the mental burden on the locals will be too large. I disagree with the move to revise national security legislation and the constitution too. I want Japan to remain a peaceful country as it is Around Henoko of Okinawa where the mammalian dugongs of the sea in the crisis of the extinction inhabit is one of the sea areas where biodiversity is the richest in Japan. A human being does not have the right to break the variety into. If Japan and the United States which are a developed country take the lead to perform the environmental disruption while the world sings environmental protection, the other countries must be angry. I think that they should think about not only the political element but also the environmental element and should make a conclusion for the issue of transference.  I think so, too. Environment is not the thing which a human being may destroy. In addition, the human being grows by nature, and anyone know that we are healed by its beautiful scenery. I think that the transference supporter should reconsider such a natural idea.  I oppose to advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko, too. Now, the relationship between the Japanese government and Okinawa is not good because of US bases problem. It is important to discuss the political issues. In addition, I assume we need to think about the environmental issues to protect the beautiful environment in Okinawa.  I support Abe on this point. The construction of a new US base is necessary for Japan. Protesters are usually emotional and what they say is a little worthy of listening to. To cope with threat od China, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity. The right of self-defense is guaranteed as the natural right. So, there is no problem that Japan exercise the self-defense right.  To begin with, there was an agreement with America. The Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama spoiled it. If he had not become the Prime Minister, the construction of a new US base would have advanced.  X= people in Okinawa necessarily disagree O= people in Okinawa do not necessarily disagree This is the first time I've heard this. I oppose the construction of a new US base. We should protect nature and beautiful scene. I think it good that famous persons like Oe take concrete action. And Japanese government has to lend an ear to the voice of the people living in Okinawa.  I think so. If more US base is construct in Okinawa, it will impose a burden on Okinawa. And the friction between Japanese government and Okinawa will worsen. So, I think Japan and the United States should not advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko.  I often go to Okinawa. Seas in Okinawa are very beautiful. We can look fish which is swimming because water is very clean. Therefore I strongly believe that we should protect the nature in Okinawa. In addition I really looked Okinawa US base. Then I was very surprised because airplane was very fast and very noisy. I think that US bases are very dangerous and harm for people who live in Okinawa. All in all, I think that we should think about US bases and produce the solution.  I agree with you. Sea in Okinawa is very beautiful and there are many farms of sugarcane. I strongly believe that we should protect these nature. If we set up the US base in Okinawa, it connect to destroy the nature of Okinawa. In addition, US bases are very dangerous. Therefore Japanese people should insist that stop to set up the US bases in Okinawa.  Unfortunately, I have never been to Okinawa. However, I often see clear sea in Okinawa on TV and the Internet. Nature is great and respectable. If China attacked and occupied Okinawa, a lot of factories would be constructed. The factory would emit toxic sewage and smoke. Therefore transparent sea in Okinawa would be destroyed. To keep the clear sea, the construction of a new US base is necessary.  I disagree with Kenzaburo Oe for some reasons. It is true that some people say that the construction of a new US base will spoil clear and beautiful sea in Okinawa. However, China is threatening Japan with the navy today. So, Japan must more cooperate with America. And protesters such as Kenzaburo Oe do not show a concrete counterproposal. They are emotional and sensational.  I know it is not a good thing for Okinawans, and many Japanese people disagree with the new base construction in Henoko. However, although the Japanese people disagree with it, nobody help them. Any prefectures give their name in place of Henoko. Therefore, this issue does not advance for a long time. All governors in Japan should discuss about it, and if they cannot solve the problem, the Prime Minister Abe has to try to discuss with the US  Natural selection is inevitable. If the construction of a new US base were called off, it would be easy for China to attack Japan. If China attacked Japan, as a result, nuclear weapons would be used. Human beings would be extinct by nuclear weapons. Is it a natural selection? God knows it. However, we must keep the prosperity of human beings. Therefore, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity for prosperity of human beings.  I think this movement which famous people take the lead in insisting on peace is very effective because people tend to be influenced by them. People in Nago may be encouraged to have hope by them. Recently, the government of Japan attempt to change the interpretation of the Constitution, especially, Article 9. However, many people are against this idea. I think we should protect Article 9 just as it is because it is a symbol of Japanese peace. It has passed 70 years since the Second World War was over. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and think about Japanese future developments.  I totally agree and am with Mr. Oe's position against the construction of US military basement in Henoko since it seems that the government has not learnt we have so criticized about the base in Okinawa. Even if Japan are forced to have them because of the lost in WWII, we have to minimize the number of the bases as it produces lots of harms like noise and crash.  Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to take priority on thinking about our lives first. And there isn't much threat of China for instance and even afterwards too I think, so we don't have to extend our self-defense power. If we do that, it will irritate other countries of course.  I agree with Oe's idea, what the Okinawan citizens will win. And I also wish for it. I think the problem of Futenma air station is unreasonable. All people should have the right of living peaceful. So it is very dangerous thing to change the constitution. Not only Okinawan people but also all Japanese people who think so too should try not to happen the situation.  I think, if China want to attack us by nuclear weapons, they do it although we don't have the Henoko base. That's because Japan have many US bases already. I can't understand why we need more bases with people's pain.  I oppose new American base. Why the government disregard nation's voice. I think that what's he does is Japan before the WW2's government. And Okinawa's things is to reflection the people who live there. What Mr. Oe who works publicly act this like is the important things . Because famous person have a great influence.  I agree with Oe Kenzaburo, even though I don't like his literature. Although, where will Futenma base move to? It is impossible to move outside the prefecture. I predict that the base will remain Futenma.  I agree with your opinion. We have to protect the beautiful nature of Okinawa.  I have never been to Okinawa, but I know that there are a lot of problem about World War two and American armies in Okinawa. Henoko's people disagree with the new base construction. I agree with people in Henoko. Japanese Prime Minister Abe must try to discuss about American army with American politicians.  Okinawa used to be a one country since it had own culture. I think Okinawa should be one public culture. But Okinawa's own economic is not enough to support its country. "
ACA ACA-AS6-002 -0.17 "Race, Injustice, and Disorder John Benyon and John Solomos INTRODUCTION Civil disorder and unrest were recurring phenomena in many British inner-city areas during the 1980s. In 1980, 1981, and 1985 major riots in Bristol, London, Liverpool, and Birmingham commanded the headlines and became a key theme in policy debates about the future of the inner cities. It is worth stressing that in each year since 1980 there have been examples of serious street disorder (Benyon, 1984; Benyon and Solomos, 1987). These outbreaks of disorder have presented a major challenge to the Thatcher Government's image as the guardian of public order. More importantly, however, they have given added urgency to the long-running debate about the future of Britain's inner cities. The sight of violent confrontations on the streets of major cities helped to stimulate yet further the acrimonious political debate about how to regenerate depressed inner-city localities (Robson, 1988). This chapter explores the political and policy debates surrounding the major outbreaks of urban unrest during 1980–1 and 1985, and the ever-present threat of more violent disorder. After providing a brief overview of the chronology of urban unrest during the 1980s, the chapter concentrates on two main themes. First, the political debates about the origins and causes of the unrest are assessed, and second, the impact of the unrest on the policy agenda is examined. This entails a review of the impact of the Scarman Report, and other important policy documents, on the agenda of both the Government and other political institutions. Finally, the chapter concludes by providing some reflections about the prospects during the decade ahead. THE CONTEXT OF URBAN UNREST: 1981 AND 1985 The first notable instance of urban unrest during the 1980s took place in the St Paul's district of Bristol on 2 April 1980. The immediate reaction to this event was one of shock and surprise, with public and media attention focusing particularly on the interplay between racial and social deprivation in the St Paul's area (Joshua and Wallace, 1983). A year later further serious violence occurred during the weekend of 10–12 April 1981 in the Brixton area of south London; this resulted in many injuries and widespread damage, and it attracted enormous media attention. Further disturbances took place in many parts of the country in July 1981. On Friday, 3 July a pitched battle occurred in Southall between hundreds of skinheads and local Asian people, and the police quickly became embroiled. On the same night in the Liverpool 8 district of Merseyside, an apparently minor incident sparked off rioting which lasted until Monday, 6 July. The disorder in Liverpool 8 was particularly violent. For the first time ever in Britain, CS gas was fired at rioters by the police. Looting and arson were widespread, and the damage was estimated at some £10 million. On the night of 7–8 July 1981, disorder occurred in Moss Side, Manchester. During the following week disturbances were reported in places such as Handsworth in Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham, Hull, Slough, Leeds, Bradford, Leicester, Derby, High Wycombe, and Cirencester. Disorder again erupted in Brixton on 15 July 1981. At 2.00 a.m. eleven houses in Railton Road were raided by 176 police-officers, with a further 391 held in reserve. The police had warrants to look for evidence of unlawful drinking and to search five houses for petrol bombs, although no evidence of either was found. During the operation the houses sustained very considerable damage — windows, sinks, toilets, floorboards, furniture, televisions, and personal possessions were smashed. The resultant outcry led to an internal inquiry which exonerated those involved and stated that the police officers had been issued with sledgehammers and crowbars ‘to effect speedy entry’. Compensation of £8,500 for structural damage, and further sums for damage to personal property, were paid by the Metropolitan Police. This  raid, and the resultant violence on the streets of Brixton, convinced many people that the way policing is carried out is a vital factor in the context of urban unrest. An inquiry into the Railton Road raid by the Police Complaints Board discovered ‘serious lapses from professional standards’ and an ‘institutional disregard for the niceties of the law’(Benyon and Solomos, 1987). Disorder was again evident in 1982 and in subsequent years, although on a reduced scale (Benyon and Solomos, 1987). The attention of the news media was firmly focused on the Falklands, and so few accounts of disturbances in British cities were reported. It is clear, though, that urban unrest continued to occur in parts of London and Liverpool, and similar disorder seems to have taken place in 1983. The following year, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that during 1984 there were many mini-riots which had the potential to escalate to Brixton 1981 proportions, and he added: ‘London is nowadays a very volatile city.’ A MORI opinion poll in February 1985 reported that 64 per cent of those surveyed expected further riots to occur in British cities, and seven months later their fears were justified. In September and October 1985 serious urban unrest again became the focus of popular attention. The first major eruption occurred on Monday, 9 September 1985 in the Lozells Road area of Handsworth, Birmingham. The riot resulted in the deaths of two Asian men, Kassamali and Amirali Moledina, who suffered asphyxiation in their burning post office. Another 122 people, mainly police, were reported injured and the value of damaged property was put at £7.5 million. Further rioting occurred the next day when Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, visited the area. Other disturbances, widely regarded as ‘copycat’, were reported elsewhere in the West Midlands, for example in Moseley, Wolverhampton, and Coventry, and in the St Paul's district of Bristol. The Handsworth/Soho/Lozells area, with a population of 56,300, is regarded by Birmingham City Council as the most deprived district in the city. Unemployment is a major affliction, and at the time of the riots 36 per cent of the workforce in Handsworth was out of work, while the figure for people under 24 years was 50 per cent. It is an area in which it was claimed that  reasonably good relations existed between young blacks and the police, as a result of the practice of community policing introduced in the late 1970s. However, at the end of 1981 a new superintendent instituted changes which included moving a number of the area's community police-officers to other duties and clamping down on the activities by local youths which had previously been tolerated. These changes resulted in an increase in tension between youths and the police. In July 1985 two serious disturbances occurred in Handsworth, but both were played down and went unreported in the media. The context within which the eruption on 9 September occurred was thus one of deteriorating relations between young people, especially blacks, and the police, as well as one of widespread unemployment and social disadvantage. The tinder merely required a spark, which was provided when a black youth became involved in an altercation with an officer over a parking ticket. It was alleged that during the incident, at which more police arrived, a black woman was assaulted. Three hours later some forty-five buildings in Lozells Road were ablaze. Brixton was the scene of the next outbreak of violent disorder, during the weekend 28–9 September 1985. 724 major crimes were reported, 43 members of the public and 10 police-officers were injured, and 230 arrests were made. As in Handsworth, the event which led to the rioting involved police-officers and a black person. At 7.00 a.m. on 28 September armed police entered Mrs Cherry Groce's house in Normandy Road, Brixton, looking for her son. Two shots were fired by an officer, and a bullet damaged Mrs Groce's spine causing permanent paralysis. At 6.00 p.m. the local police station was attacked with petrol bombs, and during the next eight hours large numbers of people, both black and white, took part in burning and looting which caused damage estimated at £3 million. During the riot a freelance photographer sustained injuries from which he died three weeks later. Two days after Mrs Groce was shot, rioting occurred in Toxteth (Liverpool 8). In this instance, the disturbances were precipitated when four black men were refused bail at Liverpool Magistrates' Court. During the summer there had been reports of rising tension in the area, and on 30 August a crowd demonstrated outside Toxteth Police Station and then attacked police  cars and the station itself. A number of assaults on police-officers were also reported. As in Brixton and Handsworth, police relations with youths, and especially with young black people, were a significant factor in the explosive mixture, and in Toxteth, too, the disorder was precipitated by an incident involving police officers and black people. The most serious of the disorders occurred at the Broadwater Farm Estate, in Tottenham, London. The rioting began about 7.00 p. m. on Sunday, 6 October 1985, and during a night of extraordinary violence Police Constable Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death, 20 members of the public and 223 police-officers were injured, and 47 cars and some buildings were burned. Guns were fired at the police, causing injuries to several officers and reporters, and the forces were issued with CS gas and plastic bullets, although these were not used. As in Handsworth, Brixton, and Toxteth, the context within which the disturbances occurred in Tottenham was one of deteriorating relations between the police and young people, especially blacks, and the trigger event involved police-officers and black people (Gifford, 1986). The chief superintendent for the area was a firm believer in community policing, and he put as his first priority the prevention of public disorder. However, it is clear that many of his police constables and sergeants did not agree with this approach. During the summer of 1985 there was evidence of increasing tension, and a prominent member of the Hornsey Police Federation was quoted as saying that rank and file officers ‘desperately wanted to go in hard and sort out the criminals’. Some serious incidents occurred during this period on the Broadwater Farm Estate, such as an attack on police by youths which resulted in one officer sustaining a bad head wound, and there was also a series of attacks on an Asian-owned supermarket. Senior police-officers appeared to play these incidents down, but black youths complained that on the estate they were increasingly harassed by the police. The incident which precipitated the riot began when police-officers stopped a car driven by Floyd Jarrett, a 23-year-old black man well known in the area. One of the officers decided to arrest Jarrett for suspected theft of the car, but after an altercation Jarrett  was in fact charged with assaulting a police-officer. On 13 December 1985 Jarrett was acquitted of this charge, and was awarded £350 costs against the police. While he was detained at the police station a number of police-officers used a key taken from the arrested man to enter his mother's home. During the police search of the house Mrs Cynthia Jarrett collapsed. The family alleged that her death was caused by a police-officer who pushed her over; the police denied that this had occurred. On 4 December 1985 the inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. Mrs Jarrett was certified dead at 6.35 p.m. on Saturday, 5 October, and news of the tragedy spread quickly around the estate during the evening. The next day, after sporadic incidents, violent disorder erupted at about 7.00 p. m. Disorder occurred again in 1986. During the spring there were renewed reports of increasing tension in some areas. In Notting Hill, for example, there were allegations of assaults by the police, and the planting of drugs, while in Nottingham a number of forced entries into black people's homes and a series of street searches caused widespread anger. On the Broadwater Farm Estate virtually every black male under 30 was interrogated — over 350 people were arrested although most were released without charge. In July 1986 the Metropolitan Police mounted a huge raid in Brixton, involving nearly 2,000 officers, aimed at selected premises in which cannabis offences were allegedly being committed. In early September 1986 serious disorder occurred on the streets of the North Prospect Estate in the Devonport constituency of Plymouth. A large crowd of white youths set up burning barricades and smashed windows, doors, and fences on the estate. A few days later the Avon and Somerset Police organized a large raid in the St Paul's district of Bristol. Almost exactly one year after the Handsworth riots, 600 police moved into the area to search several premises in connection with drugs and drinking offences. The reaction was serious rioting and attacks on the police involving petrol bombs, bricks, and stones. In 1987 disorder occurred in Wolverhampton after a black youth died of asphyxiation while being arrested on 20 February. Later in the year, violent clashes occurred on the streets of  MAKING SENSE OF THE 1981 RIOTS Reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred. Lord Scarman's report on the 1981 disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment, urban deprivation, racial disadvantage, relations between young blacks and the police, the decline of civic consent, and political exclusion as the key issues. Other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain. Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in British society (Gaffney, 1987; Hall, 1987; Keith, 1987). The main issues that were prominent in debates during 1980–1 were ‘race’ and ‘law and order’. This was by no means an accident, since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of media, political, and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how Britain was drifting into a ‘violent society’, and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas. A glimpse of the impact of the 1980–1 riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in Parliament. The first took place in the midst of the July 1981 riots, and had as its theme: ‘Civil Disturbances’. The tone of the debate was set by Home Secretary William Whitelaw's introductory statement in which he spoke of (a) the need to ‘remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets’, and (b) the urgency of developing ‘policies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends’(Hansard , vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1405). The ‘scourge of criminal violence’ was, Whitelaw argued, a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the  political institutions of British society were based. In reply Roy Hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence, but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in British society (ibid.: cols. 1407–9) The second debate took place on 26 November 1981, on the publication of the Scarman Report, and had as its theme: ‘Law and Order’. The importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue, and specifically policing, on to the main political agenda was emphasized by the Liberal leader, David Steel, who argued that ‘urgent action’ to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective (Hansard , vol. 13, 26 November 1981: cols. 1009–11). A subsequent debate on the same issue in March 1982 was also full of references to the experience of 1981, the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities, and the spectre of ‘more violence to come’ if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced (Hansard , vol. 20, 25 March 1982: cols. 1107–81). The need to support the police was accepted by both the Labour and the Conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots, and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the Scarman Report was published in November 1981. Any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets. Intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment, particularly among the young, and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty (Solomos, 1988, pp. 186–911). Throughout 1980 and 1981 debates about the riots in the media, in Parliament, and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial, law-and-order, and social factors. The importance of this debate can be explained, partly, by the political capital which the Opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances. Conversely, throughout this period Government Ministers strenuously denied  that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest. Although the Scarman Report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between ‘social conditions’ and ‘disorder’, the terms of the debate were by no means set by Scarman. During both April and July 1981 vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in Parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots. During the 16 July parliamentary debate on ‘Civil Disturbances’, Roy Hattersley's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the ‘social conditions’ argument. After some preliminary remarks about the Labour party's support for the police, he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts: I repeat that I do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police. It was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities — areas in which the Brixton and Toxteth riots took place, and areas from which the skinhead invaders of Southall come. (Hansard , vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1408) Much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment. Hattersley had suggested that the riots were a ‘direct product’ of high levels of youth unemployment, and a furious debate ensued in both Parliament and the media about this assertion. The final symbolic cue used to make sense of the 1980–1 protests is more difficult to categorize, but its basic meaning can be captured by the term ‘political marginality’. While a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the United States have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests (Skolnick, 1969; Fogelson, 1971; Edelman, 1971; Knopf, 1975), this issue has received relatively little attention in Britain. Nevertheless, during the 1980–1 events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives. The Scarman Report, for example, located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness  which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas. A successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future (Scarman, 1981, para. 6.42). Where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race, violence and disorder, and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports. The Scarman Report, for example, contained the following policy proposal: ‘I recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning, in the provision of local services, and in the management and financing of specific projects,(Scarman, 1981, para. 8.44). Such a move towards greater political integration was seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged. But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts. This did not, however, stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all, as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur. Aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter. PERSPECTIVES ON THE 1985 RIOTS Despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981, the scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators. Handsworth, for example, was presented even shortly before September 1985 as a ‘success story’ in terms of police — community relations. The outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration. Similarly the spread of violence in London to areas such as the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham  was seen as a break from previous experience, which had centred on areas such as Brixton. There are many continuities between 1980–1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense images used in the press and television to cover the events. But responses in 1985 were different, at least in terms of degree, and probably in relation to the extent to which the riots were seen as a ‘race’ phenomenon by a wider body of opinion. The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980–1 had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people. During the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath, the imagery of ‘race’ was used by sections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in 1980–1. The ‘silence over race’ was breached in 1980–1, but in 1985 debate about racial issues was taken a step further. Peregrine Worsthorne, for example, used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth, Brixton, and Tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the ‘coloured population’ into mainstream ‘British values’(Sunday Telegraph, 29 September 1985). To be sure there was still a strong response opposing Enoch Powell's call for repatriation, from all shades of political opinion, but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riots went much further than 1980–1. In this context it was the externality of British Afro-Caribbeans and Asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society. The usage of ‘race’ during the September-October 1985 period took on new meanings, which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such, since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves. After Handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between West Indians and Asians, and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents; and community leaders, they were used to ‘explain’'what happened. In addition, the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities, their family structures, and their political attitudes ‘bred violence’ was constantly raised (van Dijk, 1988). The actual facts' of who was arrested during the riots, whether black or white, were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime (Keith, 1987). The imagery of the ‘black bomber, used in Handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an ‘orgy of looting’. The Dear Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks: The majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young, black and Afro-Caribbean origin. Let there be no doubt, these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the Afro-Caribbean community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the West Midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen. We share a common sorrow. It is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the actions of a criminal minority. (Dear, 1985, p. 69) This ‘black’ criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots, but sometimes as the only force. Indeed, throughout September and October 1985, and during the following months, the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots. As pointed out earlier, the ‘social causes’ argument was another major plank of public debate about the 1980–1 riots, particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment. During 1985 this issue was raised once again, though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay was more stark than it had been in 198l. Images of ‘urban decay’, ‘tinderbox cities’, and ‘ghetto streets’ linked up with the images of ‘race inequality’and ‘black ghettos’to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory. An interesting mixture of the various images was provided by a story in the Daily Telegraph under the headline: ‘Broadwater Farm: Like the Divis Flats with Reggae’(8 October 1985). The Mirror described the estate as ‘Living Hell’, and quoted one resident as saying that ‘You've no idea how awful daily life is’(8 October 1985). Such images were reworkings of arguments  already used about Toxteth in 1981 and Brixton in 1981, but they were used more widely than in 1980–1. Even the Daily Mail , which deployed the clearest use of ‘race’ and ‘outside agitator’arguments, ran a major story on Broadwater Farm under the headline: ‘Burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle…despair hangs heavy’(8 October 1985). A number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period, but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates (Hansard , vol. 84, 21 October 1985, cols. 30-.46, 388), and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in Birmingham and London. The ‘cities of inner despair’ were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest, and however hard the Government tried to break the causal link between the two, it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities. Much as in 1980–1, the ‘social causes’ argument cannot be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the British economy and society. The Government's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue, and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies. But the Government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate: namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs. The emphasis on ‘crime’ and the ‘criminal acts’of the rioters in the official responses to the 1985 riots took a general and a specific form. The general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police, but a ‘criminal act’ or a ‘cry for loot’. This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands (Dear, 1985) and by Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, in relation to Handsworth. But it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots. The specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton, in particular, was brought about by ‘drug barons’ who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control ‘their  territory’. Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in Dear's report on Handsworth, and in press coverage during the riots. Taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and ‘drug barons’ in stimulating the riots, this seems to have served two purposes. First, it distanced the riots from the social, economic, political, and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the ‘social problems’ of inner-city dwellers and in the ‘simple greed’of the drug barons to accumulate ‘loot’. Second, just as Dear's image of a few hundred ‘young black criminals’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level. The issue of drugs provided an everyday image, already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate, around which the police, the Home Office, and other institutions could depoliticize the riots. Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place: ‘The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night, the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday, was not a cry for help but a cry for loot’(Financial Times , 13 September 1985). The Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Geoffrey Dear, took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place, with the support of local community leaders. He drew the conclusion from this that the riot ‘came like a bolt out of the blue’(Guardian , 21 November 1985). Such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were ‘breaking the law’, ‘committing criminal acts’, and threatening the interests of the law-abiding ‘majority’. SYMBOLIC POLITICS AND POLICY INITIATIVES The 1980–1 and 1985 riots resulted in a wide variety of responsive measures, emanating from both central and local government, as well as other agencies. The very multiplicity of ideological constructions of the riots is an indication of the complexity of the  responses which resulted in policies and programmes of action. There are, however, three analytically distinct and important political and policy responses which need to be examined:(a) the Scarman Report;(b) policing and law and order (c) economic and social policies. The Scarman Report In the aftermath of the April 1981 riots in Brixton the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, used his powers under the 1964 Police Act to appoint Lord Scarman to inquire into the events, produce a report, and make recommendations. This brief was subsequently widened to cover the occurrence of other disturbances during July 1981. Lord Scarman's inquiry was not on the same scale as the famous Kerner Report in 1968 on the US riots, but since the publication of his Report in November 1981 his views and prescriptions have played an important role in fashioning political debate about the riots. It is therefore important to look into the basic analysis which the Scarman Report puts forward in order to understand how the political agenda has developed, in response to the riots, since 1980. The starting-point of Lord Scarman's explanation of the riots is important. His analysis began by distinguishing between the background factors which had created the potential for urban disorder in areas such as Brixton and the precipitating action or event which sparked off the riots. Scarman identified two views that were commonly held as to the causation of the disorders. The first explained them in terms of oppressive policing, and in particular the harassment of young blacks. The second explained them as a protest against society by deprived people who saw violent attacks upon the forces of law and order as a way of calling attention to their grievances. For Scarman both views were a simplification of a complex reality, or at least‘not the whole truth’. He linked the ‘social’ and ‘policing’aspects of the complex reality of areas like Brixton in an analytic model which emphasized the following issues: 1. the problems which are faced in policing and maintaining order in deprived, inner-city, multi-racial localities; 2. the social, economic, and related problems which are faced by all residents of such areas; 3. the social and economic disadvantages which are suffered particularly by black residents, especially young blacks. (Scarman, 1981, paras. 2. 1–2.38) He saw the existence of all these features in certain deprived areas as ‘creating a predisposition towards violent protest’, which could be sparked off by incidents such as confrontations between local residents and the police or by rumours about the actions of the police or other authority figures. From this account Lord Scarman drew the conclusion that once the ‘predisposition towards violent protest’ had taken hold it was difficult to reverse. Talking about the position of young blacks, he noted that because they felt neither ‘socially nor economically secure’ many of them had drifted into situations where more or less regular confrontations with the police were the norm of their daily experience. Noting that despite the evidence of academic and government reports, which had pointed to widespread discrimination against young blacks, very little had been done to remedy the position, Scarman concluded that:(a) many young blacks believed that violence was an effective means of protest against their conditions; and (b) far from the riots being a meaningless event, they were ‘essentially an outburst of anger and resentment by young black people against the police’(Scarman, 1981, paras. 3. 110 and 2.38). What is important to note here is that aside from Lord Scarman's condemnation of the ‘criminal acts’ committed during the riots, the Report was a strong argument in favour of a historical and social explanation of the riots. Given the close link which the Scarman Report established between questions of policing and the ‘wider social context’, the programme of action which it outlined contained proposals not only about the reform of the police and the introduction of new methods of policing and riot control, but about employment policy, social policy, and policies on racial discrimination. In a telling phrase Lord Scarman argued: ‘The social conditions in Brixton do not provide an excuse for disorder. But the disorders  cannot be fully understood unless they are seen in the context of complex political, social and economic factors which together create a predisposition towards violent protest’(para. 8.7). Although some of these issues went beyond the main remit of his Inquiry, he drew the conclusion from this basic finding that only a national government-led initiative to deal with problems of policing, unemployment, poor housing, and racial disadvantage could get to the roots of the unrest. Parliamentary and media responses to the Report varied greatly, although it was widely seen as making an important contribution to the debate about how to respond to the riots and prevent the outbreak of violence in the future. But what became clear after the immediate debate on the Report in late 1981 and early 1982, was that the Government was not going to implement all the recommendations. Some aspects of its proposals for reforming the police and rethinking police tactics were implemented during 1982 and 1983, but evidence of the ‘urgent action’ which it called for in other areas remained difficult to find. This returns us to the earlier point about the other major forces which contributed to the development of political responses to the riots: namely the media, Parliament, the political parties, and popular ‘common-sense’ debate. The Scarman Report formed a part — and a vital one — of this process of political debate, but its role cannot be understood in isolation. This can be seen if we look more closely at the issues of policing and economic and social problems. Policing and law and order Indeed, in the aftermath of the Scarman Report's publication, police opinion was divided on the question of whether its proposals for reforming the police and the adoption of new methods of policing could be implemented, or whether such changes could insure against further violence and unrest. The policy responses after the 1985 riots show some of the same characteristics as those during 1980–1, but as argued earlier, the emphasis on the ‘criminality’ of the riot participants favoured explanations that linked disorder to the pathological characteristics  of inner-city residents which pushed them towards lawlessness and crime. This in turn produced a sharper contrast than in 1980–1 between (a) responses which emphasized the need to strengthen and buttress the role of the police, and (b) responses which called for greater emphasis on the rejuvenation of the social and economic fabric of the inner cities. Economic and social policies In terms of economic and social policies the impact of the 1980–1 riots was equally ambiguous and contradictory. Part of this ambiguity, as outlined above, resulted from the Government's strenuous efforts to deny any link between its policies and the outbreak of violence and disorder. This denial was particularly important, since at the time the Thatcher administration was going through a bad period in terms of popular opinion on issues such as unemployment, social services, and housing. While Lord Scarman was careful not to enter the political dispute between the Government and the Labour party on issues such as unemployment and housing, his call for more direct action to deal with these problems, along with racial disadvantage, posed a challenge to the political legitimacy of the policies which the Government had followed from 1979 onwards. It also posed a delicate problem for the Home Secretary himself, since Lord Scarman had been appointed by him to carry out his Inquiry. Having spent the whole summer denying any link between its policies and the riots, the Government had to tread warily in responding to the economic and social policy proposals of the Scarman Report when it was published in November 1981. The parliamentary debate on the Report showed the Home Secretary adopting a two-pronged strategy in his response. First, he accepted many of the recommendations of the Report, particularly in relation to the role of the police. Additionally, he accepted the need to tackle racial disadvantage and other social issues. Second, he emphasized the Government's view that, whatever broader measures were taken to deal with racial and social inequalities, the immediate priority was to restore and maintain order on the streets. When the Home Secretary talked of  the need for the Government to give a lead in tackling racial disadvantage he therefore saw this as in issue for the longer term. On the other hand, he was much more specific about the reform of the police and the development of new tactics and equipment for the management of urban disorder (Hansard , vol. 14, 10 December 1981: cols. 1001–8). In 1985, however, the Government specifically rejected calls for another inquiry like Lord Scarman's, arguing that since the riots were a ‘criminal enterprise’ it was useless to search for social explanations or to have yet another report advising it about what to do. Implicitly, the Government was saying that it knew what the problems were, and how they could be tackled. While some senior policemen, like Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, wanted to stress the link between the police and other areas of ‘social policy’(Metropolitan Police, 1986), the official government response attempted to decontextualize the riots and see them as the actions of a small minority who were either criminalized or influenced by extreme political ideas. The dominant approach of the Government attempted to emphasize two main arguments. 1. that the riots were ‘a lust for blood’, an ‘orgy of thieving’, ‘a cry for loot and not a cry for help’; 2. that the riots did not reflect a failure to carry out the ‘urgent programme of action’ recommended by Lord Scarman in 1981, but were the outcome of a spiralling wave of crime and disorder in inner-city areas. The logic of this approach, articulated by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd most clearly, was that the riots were both ‘unjustifiable’ and a ‘criminal activity’. In a widely reported speech to police chiefs at the time of the disorders Hurd made this point clear: Handsworth needs more jobs and better housing. But riots only destroy. They create nothing except a climate in which necessary development is even more difficult. Poor housing and other social ills provide no kind of reason for riot, arson and killing. One interviewer asked me whether the riot was not a cry for help by the rioters. The sound which law-abiding people heard at Handsworth was not a cry for help but a cry for loot. That is why the first priority, once public order is secure, must be a  thorough and relentless investigation into the crimes which were committed. (Daily Telegraph , 14 September 1985) Such arguments resonated through the media and in the various parliamentary debates during September and October 1985. They became part of the symbolic political language through which the riots were understood by policy makers and by popular opinion. Since the 1985 unrest, and particularly after the 1987 General Election, the Government has announced a number of initiatives on the inner city, and it has presented these as part of an effort to rejuvenate depressed areas on a sound basis. The evidence that has emerged since then, however, points to a major discrepancy between the Government's promises of action and the allocation of resources to implement them (Robson, 1988). It is perhaps too early to reach a conclusion on this point, but a repeat of the period of inaction between 1982 and 1985 seems to be evident, within the current political context. A number of local authorities have attempted to take more positive action to deal with the issues raised by the 1985 riots, but their experience has shown that such local initiatives are often severely limited by the actions of national government, the police, and broader economic and political pressures. In the years since 1981 the one consistent response to urban unrest has been the provision of more resources, more training, and more equipment to the police. Instead of tackling the causes of urban unrest, the Government has built up force to deal with the manifestation of those root conditions. Increasingly the most strident political voices are raised in the name of free enterprise and law and order, not for equity and social justice. For the New Right and other influential sectors of political opinion the attempt to achieve racial equality through legal and political means is at best naïve political folly, and at worst a restriction on the workings of the market. The present political climate gives little cause for optimism that a radical change in governmental priorities in this field is likely (Solomos, 1989). The Government's plan of Action for Cities (DoE, 1987), issued  after Mrs Thatcher's post-election promise, says very little directly about racial inequality. It remains to be seen whether it will suffer the fate of numerous other initiatives on the inner cities and fade into obscurity. But one thing seems clear: during the past decade the Government has been more intent on reducing the powers of local authorities than on providing for fundamental changes in the social conditions of the inner cities. CONCLUSION: LITTLE ROOM FOR OPTIMISM Despite the Government's recently proclaimed intention of regenerating the inner cities, there is little room for optimism. Unless radical action is taken, British cities seem poised to become yet more turbulent, brutalized, and trouble-torn. The excluded black and white citizens in the urban areas seem set to continue to suffer deprivation and disadvantage. The remedy of using tough policing is merely tackling the symptoms of the disorder, and is liable to exacerbate the underlying malaise. This approach should come as no surprise, however. History shows that the usual response to violent protest and riots was repression. History also shows that this course was normally ineffective and that disorder only diminished when movement was made in the direction of the reforms which were demanded. The auguries for such reforms are not good, and further urban unrest remains in prospect."
ACA ACA-CMA-002 -0.19 "A DARWINIAN PLANT ECOLOGY John L. HARPER ‘…on a piece of ground 3 feet long and 2 feet wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants; thus out of 20 species growing on a little plot of mown turf (3 feet by 4 feet) 9 species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up freely’(The Origin of Species ). It is difficult to detect any direct influence of Darwin's writings on the development of the main stream of plant ecology. The extreme reductionist approach that is represented in the above quotation, and is apparent again and again in his writings, not only in The Origin of Species but in many of his later books, is conspicuous by its absence from early plant ecological texts and is barely represented in the ecological literature until towards the middle of the twentieth century. The approach that involved marking individual plants or seedlings in the field, tracing the fate of individual leaves as they are pulled down earthworm burrows, the behaviour of tendrils as they touch a support, the fate of insects as they land on a Drosera leaf, or recording the number of seeds at the bottom of an earthworm burrow, represented a reductionist level of concentrated observation that contrasted with the geographical view of vegetation with which Warming and others set the early direction of plant ecology. There is no way in which Darwin can be regarded as a parent of the science of plant ecology. Nothing illustrates this point so clearly as the fate of a paper published in 1874 by C. Nägeli entitled Verdrängung der Pflanzenformen durch ihre Mitbewerber . This paper was directly stimulated by The Origin of Species and in it Nägeli  developed mathematical models that describe the interaction between populations of two species of plants. His models attempt to describe in formal mathematical terms the replacement of a population of one species by another and also situations in which pairs of species persist together as stable, mixed populations. Nägeli's models included density-dependent and frequency-dependent situations and came very close to providing a formal description of the niche. It might have been expected that such a paper from Nägeli, who was one of the most distinguished botanists in Europe at that time, would have had immense impact on the early development of plant ecology. Instead, it appears to have been wholly ignored for 60 years until it was mentioned briefly by Gauze (1934) in his book The Struggle for Existence . Plant ecology developed not as a study of the factors affecting the lives and deaths of individual plants and their parts but as a study of the distribution of vegetation types and of particular species. It included also the description of those specialized features of morphology and physiology that distinguish species and might (often by more or less inspired guesswork) be said to account for the differences in their distribution. That these features were often called ‘adaptations’ did nothing to explain them. Much of the early science of plant ecology sought for correlations between vegetation and physical, not biotic, factors in the environment, most particularly temperature, water supply and soil types. These forces have been described as ‘Wallacian’(Harper, 1977), because they represent those agents of natural selection that were of more concern to Wallace than to Darwin in accounting for how organisms are as they are and behave as they do. The role of biotic (Darwinian) forces in determining the distribution and abundance of species was largely neglected except by token reference to grazing animals. The essentially Darwinian forces of struggle for existence, involving competitive interactions between members of the same species and between different species, played a negligible part in the interpretation of natural vegetation. The Darwinian approach, involving reductionist concentration on individual plants and the hazards that they experience, particularly the interference from their neighbours, entered the science of plant ecology in the late nineteen twenties in simple experiments involving mixed populations of two or more species and I have described elsewhere (Harper, 1967) the curious piece of history in which three leading ecologists, Sukatschev in Russia, Clements in the United States and Tansley in Britain, all made simple competition experiments involving deliberately-sown plant populations. None of these authors continued with this type of study and  all returned to essentially descriptive studies of vegetation. It was as if they had found it too difficult to bridge the gap between simple experimental systems and the complexity of nature — as if the reductionism of the experimental method lost the holist qualities of the integrated complex whole that these distinguished ecologists saw in natural vegetation. Both Clements' Community as an Organism and Tansley's Ecosystem can be represented as a retreat to community holism after a brief flirtation with an organismal, Darwinian ecology. A piece of ecological history that remains to be fully researched was the decision by a number of individuals, many apparently working in isolation from each other, to establish, like Darwin, permanent plots within which the fate of individual plants could be recorded over time. The great classic amongst such observations is the work of Carl Olaf Tamm (1948, 19721 who marked out permanent quadrats in woodland and grassland near his country home and as a hobby mapped, remapped and continues to map the plants within them. Tamm attributes his decision to embark on this long-term programme to stimulus from Romell, a distinguished Swedish ecologist and soil scientist. Other permanent quadrats were set up by Forrest Shreve (1915) at the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington at Tucson, Arizona, and it appears to be through a colleague of Shreve, W. A. Cannon, that T. G. B. Osborn was stimulated in 1926 to set up permanent quadrats in heavily used shrub land and a reserve released from grazing at Koonamore in S. Australia (Osborn, Wood & Partridge, 1935; O. B. Williams & Mott, 1981). There is also a European tradition that precedes the work of Tamm, associated with the name of Bogdanovskaya-Gienef (1926) who seems to have been a pupil of Sukatschev and to have influenced the reductionist approach to ecology later developed by Rabotnov, Uranov and their pupils in Russia. She reported her two-year study of four 20 × 20 cm quadrats. Her publications list appears to consist of only two papers, but she may have had a greater influence than this suggests (J. White, personal communication). The peculiar quality of Tamm's work was that he recorded individual plants, shoots or rosettes, within his populations and this enabled him to follow the fates of individual plant units (often tillers or ramets) rather than to study the grosser vegetational change that was the aim of many others who set up permanent quadrats. The data obtained from Tamm's studies revealed, for the first time, the magnitude of the flux that underlay, the apparent stability of many plant communities and (after Darwin) gave the first real insight into plant community dynamics dominated by establishment and deaths. Vegetation is composed of the few plants that survive  and grow: to explain that vegetation it may be more important to study the many that die. In many of Tamm's populations it can be shown (Harper, 1967) that the plants originally present were progressively lost and that the rate of loss was remarkably constant. Half-lives could be calculated for the populations — differing from species to species but constant over the years. Such data made it clear that (i) it was realistic and profitable to study individual species, even within a complex community and (ii) that the dynamics of the populations appeared to be largely independent of year-to-year fluctuations in climate. Later studies of permanent quadrats in grassland by Sagar, Sarukhän, Hawthorn and others (see Harper, 1977) extended over fewer years but involved repeated observations within each year. They showed that the death risks to plants in populations within years were commonly greatest when the survivors were growing fastest — not during the periods when the anthropomorphically-minded botanist would regard the physical environment as ‘harsh’. The likely explanation is that it is biotic pressure from competing neighbours rather than‘harshness’ of the physical environment that is the prime cause of death of most plants and perhaps of natural selection. Most of these detailed demographic studies have been made with pasture or woodland systems in northern temperate regions and it could well be that in arid zones, and some other extreme environments, biotic pressures are less dominant and then climatic factors may play the major role in killing plants and in natural selection. At a Symposium organized to pay tribute to Darwin a hundred years after his death, it is perhaps permitted to expand on one tiny fragment of ecological research that may truly be said to have been directly stimulated by Darwin's own writings, in particular by the paragraph quoted as heading to this paper. Early in the 1960s the decision was made to concentrate a number of intensive ecological studies based at Bangor, North Wales, on a single, small (1 ha) field of permanent grassland, part of the College Farm at Henfaes, Aber, near Bangor. The field was chosen because it was superficially very dull — lacking any obvious heterogeneity of contour and relatively homogeneous in soil properties. The field had not been ploughed for at least 80 years (probably not for more than 150 years) and there is no record of fertilizer or herbicide ever having been applied. A general description of the field is given in Turkington & Harper (1979a) and more detailed analysis of the soil and flora in Turkington (1975). Many graduate students and overseas visitors have worked on aspects of the ecology of this field. In many cases the studies have concentrated  on populations of a single species within 1 m&sup2; quadrats, though sometimes the reductionist level of study has been yet smaller — a scale of 1 cm&sup2;(Thorhallsdottir, 1983). The concentration of effort within one small field, and on small quadrats within it, gives the studies high precision and high relevance but with an absolute sacrifice of generality. We do not know whether most of what we have observed in this field can be generalized to other fields or, indeed, to less intensively studied parts of the same field. The vegetation of the field was analysed by ordination and correlation techniques which showed that only a minor part of the variation in species distribution could be accounted for by underlying edaphic factors, though in the peripheral areas of the pasture the presence of hedges and trees accounted for significant changes in the vegetation — e.g. Dadtylis glomerata occurred mainly in or close to the shade of the trees. Two common species,Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens were usually positively associated in their microdistribution and negatively associated with other species. The structure of the vegetation was interpreted as determined by regeneration cycles directed by T. repens and L. perenne — the species themselves appeared to be the prime determinants of each others distribution (Turkington and Harper, 1979a, b). The most intensive studies on the field have been made on populations of three species of Ranunculus and on Trifolium repens . Some of the work is still in midstream and consequently some material referred to in this paper represents an interim report. Two of the species present in the field are of particular interest, both to population biologists interested in the manner in which the numbers of plants are regulated and to evolutionists concerned with the extent and significance of natural variation. The two species are Ranunculus repens and Trifolium repens . Both possess the property of clonal growth by which the product of a single zygote forms a spreading clone of rooted nodes capable of vegetative extension through the sward. Such plants have the potential for a single clone or genet (product of a single zygote) to dominate large areas of the vegetation. Indeed, it would be theoretically possible for one genet of Trifolium repens or Ranunculus repens to have occupied the whole of the Henfaes field. In other plants with such clonal growth it is known that the product of a single zygote may indeed occupy considerable areas of land. An extreme example is bracken,Pteridium aquilinum ; Oinonen (1967) showed that individual clones in Finland were up to 1440 years old and one old clone extended over an area of 474 × 292 m. There are other cases in which clone-forming species are known to produce large areas of genetic monotony, e.g. Festuca rubra (Harberd, 1961) and Holcus  mollis (Harberd 1967). It might be expected that where such clonal growth is possible, the struggle for existence over long periods of stable management would lead to the local dominance of single clones — those that had succeeded in a struggle for existence with others. The population dynamics and genetics of these two species in the permanent pasture at Henfaes seemed to over the opportunity to study natural selection in action — Hutchinson's ‘ecological theater and evolutionary play’. Population dynamics of Ranunculus repens The detailed demographic studies of Ranunculus repens made by Sarukhán in the field at Henfaes and followed by unpublished studies by Soane made it possible to give quantitative measures to the population dynamics of this species. These are summarized in the life-cycle diagram of Fig. 16.1. Populations of this species showed vigorous vegetative growth, and most new rosettes recruited to the population appeared as ramets (clonal replicates) from existing rosettes. The input of new seedlings was small and the number eventually contributing to mature rosettes in the pasture seemed insignificant in comparison with the contribution from clonal growth. In comparison with the other two species of Ranunculus, R. acris and R. bulbosus present in the pasture, seed production and the numbers of seedlings observed was very small. Plants of Ranunculus repens produced  on average less than one seed per rosette (cf. ca 10 for R. acris, ca . 15 for R. bulbosus ). In the studied quadrats, 25 seedlings of Ranunculus repens emerged per metre square from the long-lived bank of seeds in the soil, in contrast with 176 of Ranunculus acris and 95 of Ranunculus bulbosus . The dynamics of Ranunculus repens populations was followed over four years during which new seedlings that died and those that survived to form rosettes were recorded. The development of clones from the rosettes present at the beginning of the study was also recorded in detail so that the clonal parent was known for almost every rosette present in the quadrats at the end of the study. These data allowed Soane & Watkinson (1979) to build a computer simulation model to examine the relationship between the flux of ramets, the recruitment of seedlings and the diversity of genets within   the populations. The computer models simulated the actual flux of ramets in each of eight studied populations and followed the fates of ramets and families of ramets assuming no selection between families. The real and simulated changes in the populations are shown in Fig. 16.2. Agreement is extremely close and provides little evidence for selection between families or against new seedling recruits. In the simulation model, in the absence of selection, the number of original families present in the population declined at an approximately exponential rate. With the passage of time the contribution that these families made to the total genetic diversity of the population became subordinate to the seedling recruits: although the number of seedlings appears to be very small, their contribution to the total number of genetic individuals in the population is clearly significant in determining the number of clones or genets that are present. In the absence of selection, the observed small numbers of seedling recruits would apparently be sufficient to maintain potentially high genet diversity within such a vigorously clonal plant population. Such genetic diversity was indeed present, because there was visible genetic polymorphism within the populations and it was shown (M. J. Lawrence, personal communication) that there was considerable genetic variability both in quantitative characters and in polymorphism at two enzyme loci in populations immediately adjacent to the permanent quadrats. Population dynamics and genetic variation in Trifolium repens Analysis of the population dynamics and associated genetics of Trifolium repens in the same pasture is even more revealing. Trifolium repens is unusual in that much of the genetic variation present within the populations is easily recognised in phenotypic differences that are visible or easily determined on plants in the field. Leaf mark polymorphism is one such property. A variety of white leaf marks is found in natural populations and these are represented by multiple alleles at a single locus. In mid-summer, when the marks are most fully expressed, the genotypes of most plants can be identified in the field and an estimate of the number of clones present within an area can be made: it will, of course, be a minimal estimate. Cahn & Harper (1976a) determined the number of clones present within 10 × 10 cm quadrats and found, to considerable surprise, that between 3 and 4 clones per quadrat was the most common situation in the field. This level of genetic diversity at a fine scale was confirmed in other permanent grasslands in Britain including Port Meadow, Oxford, which is  at least 896 years old! Clearly, single clones did not dominate patches even at this very fine scale. More recently, Trathan has identified genetic individuals with more precision using isoenzyme analysis. He finds 48–50 distinct genotypes present per metre square. The various clones weave amongst and intermingle with each other and amongst grasses and associated herbs. The degree of intermingling may itself reflect the growth form of stoloniferous species. Both Ranunculus repens and Trifolium repens have ‘guerrilla ’ growth forms in contrast to the predominantly ‘phalanx’forms of the associated grass species. By ‘guerrilla ’ growth form is implied one that is continually wandering amidst associated vegetation, creeping into new and escaping from old patches in the community. In contrast, ‘phalanx’ growth forms develop a structure of tightly packed shoots (most of the pasture grasses and some pasture dicots such as Bellis perennis )(Lovett Doust, 1981). Not only has Trifolium repens a guerrilla growth form but its guerrilla character is exaggerated when it is growing with grasses; its branching then tends to be reduced and growth is concentrated in linear extension. Instead of a genet locally consolidating its occupancy of a site, individual stolons wander as linear extensions of the genet into surrounding vegetation. This growth form itself maximises the chance that genets will intermingle: it maximizes the role of interspecific contacts in the life of the genet. Darwin commented on the growth of such plants and the ways in which they penetrate amongst other vegetation. He describes his own (very Darwinian!) experiment in which he allowed the stolons of Saxifraga sarmentosa (a classic ‘guerrilla ’ growth form) to encounter an artificial vegetation that he had constructed: ‘Many long pins were next driven rather close together into the sand, so as to form a crowd in front of…two thin lateral branches; but these easily wound their way through the crowd. A thick stolon was much delayed in its passage; at one place it was forced to turn at right angles to its former course; at another place it could not pass through the pins, and the hinder part became bowed; it then curved upwards and passed through an opening between the upper part of some pins which happen to diverge; it then descended and finally emerged through the crowd’(Darwin, 1880). Another approach to the study of variation within populations of white clover in the Henfaes field was made by Burdon (1980). He sampled 50 white clover clones from a grid covering the whole field. He multiplied the clones in the glasshouse and screened them for a variety of characters (Fig. 16.3). These included a number with simple Mendelian inheritance and a number of characters of agronomic importance with polygenically  controlled expression. He was able to use these characters to produce identity diagrams that distinguished and ‘finger-printed’ each clone. The 50 clones differed on average from one another in 3. 3 vegetative characters. If floral characters were included in the comparison the average difference between clones was 5.4 characters. (One pair of clones differed in 13 statistically significant and apparently independent respects!) Many of the characters considered had been shown by other workers to be of selective importance in white clover or another species of Trifolium (e.g. Cahn & Harper (1976b) had presented evidence suggesting that sheep selected between leaf marks; Dirzo & Harper (1982a) and others have shown that slugs select between cyanogenic and acyanogenic forms; Black (1960) had shown the selective value of long petioles). The polymorphisms in the Henfaes population were not exhausted in Burdon's study. It has now been shown that variation in relative growth rates can be added to the list (Burdon & Harper, 1980). Natural populations of white clover are polymorphic for incompatibility alleles and for the ability to form nitrogen fixing symbioses with strains of Rhizobium but these have not been looked at at Henfaes. Berrington (personal communication) has recently shown that clones within the field differ in their ability to form endotrophic mycorrhizal associations. The polymorphism that is found within white clover populations in the field represents therefore a subtle (or? random) variety of unique associations of apparently selectively important properties. The imagination of the most extreme selectionist is stretched to breaking point by such a situation. Evidence for local specialization within white clover Plants that are capable of clonal growth offer peculiar opportunities for testing the extent to which particular genets are locally specialized. A plant may be sampled from the field, multiplied clonally and the clonal products (genetic identities) can then be reinserted into the field, both in the places from which the clones originally came and into other places. Plants of the same genotype can then be tested in different environments. Turkington made such an experiment with white clover in the field at Henfaes (Turkington & Harper, 1979b). Clones of white clover were sampled from within patches in the field dominated by each of four common grasses,Lolium perenne, Holcus lanatus, Agrostis tenuis and Cynosurus cristatus . The clones were multiplied in the glasshouse and then transplanted back into patches of the field dominated by the four grass species. The performance of the transplants was measured by vegetative growth expressed as dry weight at harvest after twelve months. The results are shown in Fig. 16.4. Over the whole experiment clones of clover that were returned to their original grass associate made more growth than those introduced to alien sites (significant at P < 0.001). The clover clones had also been introduced into sites from which the existing vegetation had been denuded by treatment   with the paraquat herbicide. Some of the ‘principal diagonal effect’ remained, though the difference in yield between clones returned to their site and those returned to alien sites was now significant only at P < 0.05. Turkington made a further experiment in which he introduced the four clone types of white clover into pure swards of the four grass species that had been sown on soil sampled from the experimental field. This part of the experiment was designed to remove possible place-to-place variations in soil conditions in the studied field from the comparison. The yield of clones grown with the grass species from which they had originally been sampled again exceeded that made when they were grown in an ‘alien’ sward, P < 0.00001. It is difficult to interpret the results of this experiment as representing anything but evidence of precise specialization of clover clones in their ability to grow in association with particular grass neighbours. It suggests that, within the pasture, strains of white clover have been selected by competitive interaction with associated grasses and that different species of grass contribute to the diversifying or disruptive selection operating upon the population of white clover. Some, at least, of the variation within the white clover populations thus appears to be directly interpretable in terms of attributes contributing to present fitness. It is a very Darwinian interpretation to suggest that the grass neighbours may be primary forces selecting and diversifying the clover populations. Hill (1976) grew a single clone of white clover with a variety of clones of Lolium perenne . Quite distinct phenotypic modifications were elicited from the clone by the different ryegrass strains. If different strains of Lolium perenne produce different phenotypes from the same clone of white clover, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that different species of grass are even more likely to exert different selective pressures within populations of white clover. It is not easy to measure and describe just how the different clones of white clover differ in their reaction to different neighbouring grass species or forms. Survivorship and dry matter production are very gross measures of a plant's reaction to different types of neighbour. We have, at present, no real indication of the manner in which ecological compatibility (ecological combining ability) between particular strains of white clover and particular pasture grasses is accomplished. It may represent subtle differences in growth cycle or growth form or more complex interactions involving the soil microflora, perhaps the mycorrhizae. There may be subtleties of interaction below the soil surface of which we know little or nothing. The hazards in the life of a plant in the field are not only those  of competition from neighbours, though it may be these that are the most relentless. Hazards in the life of a plant in the field Some of the hazards to the life of a plant in the field can be measured by studying the fate of individual leaves or flowers or seeds. An attempt to catalogue and quantify these hazards in the field at Henfaes was made by Peters (1980) who included white clover amongst the species that he studied. He marked young leaves as they began to expand and then followed their fate by repeated observation. From this he could obtain survivorship curves for cohorts of leaves born in the same time period and record some of the causes of death or damage within the populations (Fig. 16.5). Some leaf predators leave tell-tale records of their activity. In particular, grazing molluscs leave characteristic erosions from a leaf edge; birds, particularly the wood-pigeon, feed on clover and often leave characteristic beak-marks; weevils remove circles of tissue, often leaving   the upper epidermis intact; sheep (causing damage probably indistinguishable from that caused by rabbits) remove whole leaves, leaving torn petioles or leave their bite marks on the leaflets that remain. Tracking the fate of individual leaves immediately reveals a number of other hazards. Leaves may be submerged under a dropping of dung, soused in a downpour of urine, trodden on, pulled into the ground by earthworms (further shades of Darwin) or damaged by frost. The frequency of these various events in, or ending, the life of a leaf are shown in Table 16.1. Grazing animals are, however, the major hazards for a leaf though all leaves in a pasture are not equally at risk. Weevils bite holes in the leaves of white clover and of Ranunculus species but the relative severity of attacks on Trifolium and Ranunculus change through the season,Trifolium being more attacked in early, and Ranunculus in late, summer. Fig. 16.6 shows the relative proportion of the leaf population that suffered damage from leaf grazers in populations of T. repens and R. repens . Surprisingly, the leaves of white clover suffered proportionately much less from grazing by sheep than did those of R. repens , but leaves of T. repens suffered much more from both slugs and weevils (except towards the end of the growing season). Grazing by molluscs figured so strongly among the hazards to a clover   leaf that it seems reasonable to expect that, in those years when slugs or snails were abundant, they may act as important selective forces within clover populations. White clover is polymorphic for the presence or absence of cyanogenic glucosinolates and is also polymorphic for the beta glucosidases that release HCN from glucosinolates when a leaf is damaged. There is considerable variation in the extent to which cyanogenic properties are expressed and there is some seasonal and perhaps other causes of variation in expression. Nevertheless, it is possible to classify plants in the field by taking leaf samples and performing appropriate tests (see Dirzo & Harper, 1982a) and to categorize the plants into four groups Ac Li, Ac li, ac Li, ac li. After a period of exposure to grazing one can then test for the   frequency of the various types of damage to clover leaves with the different genotypes and afterwards reconfirm the cyanogenic or acyanogenic status of the plant (Fig. 16.7). There have been many studies of selection by molluscs on cyanogenic and acyanogenic morphs of white clover under laboratory or other controlled conditions. It seemed that it might be possible to relate the variation in the polymorphism to slug density in the Henfaes field. The density of slugs was determined at sites arranged on a grid across the field at Henfaes. Dirzo (1982b) used trend-surface analysis to draw contours of mollusc density (see Fig. 16.8) and added some further information from visual inspection of the field. Most notably, he added one big and two small islands (shown in Fig. 16.8 as having high and very high slug densities) which were patches of nettle,Urtica dioica . Slugs tend to concentrate in such refuges, presumably because they give protection from desiccation. He then determined the cyanogenesis category of the clover plant nearest to each grid intersection. Table 16.2 shows the distribution of the different glucosinolate morphs of T. repens between areas with different densities of active molluscs. There is a clear excess over expectation of cyanogenic forms in the areas of high and very high mollusc density and of acyanogenic forms in the areas of very low mollusc density. It appears that some at least of the variation in the cyanogenesis polymorphism over the field can be explained as local micro-evolution in response to locally patchy selection. Two strands of evidence, that from the reciprocal transplanting of clover into the neighbourhood of different grasses and that from the study of the distribution of cyanogenic properties and the distribution of slugs, allow an easy interpretation in terms of immediate and present selective forces. How far this interpretation can be extended to the whole gamut of characters for which Burdon had shown the populations to be polymorphic must be very doubtful. Certainly almost all of the characters that Burdon lists have been shown to be of selective importance either in clover or in some related species, though sometimes under very specialized circumstances. The scientific method may sometimes mislead. We commonly test for the selective value of a particular feature by holding background variation of both genotype and environment at a minimum. We thereby maximise our chance of demonstrating what we are looking for. The real measure should be whether selection is significant against normal levels of background variation. This is why it was important to test the effects of cyanogenesis and reaction to neighbours in the field . It is difficult to believe that any of the characters examined by Burdon could be selectively neutral. However, the contribution of each property to fitness must vary dramatically from year to year as well as from place to place within the field. Most winters at Henfaes (only 400 m from the sea) are mild and frost is rare. Occasionally, as in the winter of 1982, there is severe frost. Populations of molluscs fluctuate wildly from year to year in North Wales. In some years spring growth of the sward is vigorous and exceeds the capacity of sheep and the other grazing animals to keep it fully grazed. In other years, as in the spring of 1982, a protracted spring drought slowed the growth of the sward and it became tightly graze. A severe drought is not a common feature on the field but when it occurs it may be in any month from April to September. During the period of our observations we have detected three significant leaf pathogens on white clover in the field,Uromyces trifolii, Cymadothea trifolii and Pseudopeziza trifolii . It seems unlikely that these three diseases attack with equal intensity in all seasons and in all years. In a field that is patchy in space and time, be it ever so small, we may expect that the populations of a species such as white clover will, at any time, reflect selective forces from its past. The genotypic composition of the population may in some cases dimly reflect forces that operated twenty or thirty years ago. Other selective forces may have operated quite recently and left a strong memory or image in the structure of the population's genetics. If this is the case, we would expect to find only a few of the many polymorphisms readily interpretable as responsive to present proximal selective forces. Much of the polymorphism  could be transient and, without an even more detailed history of the field, uninterpretable. It is doubtful whether such an explanation of naturally occurring polymorphism could be tested without long-term, detailed recording, not only of the variety of genetic changes occurring within clover populations, but at the same time of a detailed recording of the known hazards in the life of the clover plant over the seasons and the years. Conclusions The studies that I have described, concentrated in the field at Henfaes, are now being extended by deliberate experimentation within the field. We are destroying the site as a long-term study on a supposedly stable system by introducing a variety of perturbations such as transplant experiments, the creation of islands for invasion and further perturbations are planned. The study has involved a curious concentration of effort in one very specialized environment. The type of observations that have been made have been quintessentially Darwinian. Another great naturalist, Thoreau, has focussed attention at the same scale: ‘Nature will bear the closest inspection. She invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf, and take an insect-view of its plain'. If we are to see evolutionary processes in action in plant communities and the proximal events determining their character we must focus our attention away from an anthropomorphic scale of acres or square metres and onto a scale appropriate to the organisms with which we are concerned. The appropriate scale is determined by the organism and not by us. It will be different for different species. We ask for a plant's eye view of life and death in a sward and hope ultimately to be able to collect these reductionist observations into statements about the population, the species or even possibly the community. I doubt if it is possible to hold the view of Margalef (1968) that ‘Relevant evidence does not consist of a massive accumulation of trivia’ and reconcile it with his ‘Ecology…is the study of systems at a level at which individuals or whole organisms may be considered elements of interaction…’. It was, indeed, from the massive accumulation of trivia and tiny details, that Darwin assembled the evidence for The Origin of Species . In a volume commemorating Darwin's death, I have tried to show how his way of looking at the behaviour of individual plants in nature can be extended. A hundred years after his death his approach seems more relevant to botanical studies than it has ever been. This part of his intellectual legacy has not yet been fully invested. A part of the legacy, however, ceases to bear interest. He was writing in the Origin for readers  most of whom were steeped in Victorian optimism, religion and the romantic movement. It was necessary in 1859 to write about the process of evolution as if it produced the best of all possible worlds, a substitute for the finger of the Almighty at work. If the process of evolution had not been presented in this way (though with careful caveats) it is very questionable whether it could have been accepted so rapidly by Victorian society. It was then appropriate to show how ‘…from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved’. But ‘beauty’ and ‘wonder’are in the eye of the beholder and that eye has itself evolved. The teleology of evolution as a goal-seeking activity persists in indefensible form a hundred years later in the writing of biologists. This particular heritage may be a millstone around the neck of scientific natural history. Most particularly, it harms biology as a means of teaching science to the young (Harper, 1982). Looking back at the variety of studies conducted on plants in the little field at Henfaes, I feel little temptation to explain the behaviour of organisms within it as perfectly fitted for adaptive optima in an ideally evolved ecosystem. Rather, I see the population of plants trapped in narrowly constrained evolved ruts, bearing the battered imprint of recent and not-so-recent selective and other forces. ‘I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, not yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all’(Ecclesiastes )."
ACA ACA-CMA-004 -0.19 "SELECTION IN RELATION TO SEX T.H. CLUTTON-BROCK In many animal species, differences between the sexes are pronounced. In fact, there are relatively few morphological, physiological or behavioural characteristics that do not differ to some extent between males and females (see Glucksman, 1974) and the extent of these differences varies widely between species. For example, sexual differences in body size range from species, like worms of the genus Bonnellia , where females can be over 25 times the length of males (Barnes, 1974) to species like the southern elephant seal,Mirounga leonina , where mature males average eight times the weight of females (Bryden, 1969). Other sex differences are less apparent — such as those in fat deposition, in haemoglobin levels and in metabolic rate among mammals (see Glucksman, 1974) or those in auditory apparatus among frogs (Narins & Capranica, 1976, 1978). And many have only recently been explored: for example, recent research shows that in some species there are pronounced sex differences in feeding ecology (Gautier-Hion, 1980) as well as in the effects of starvation on survival (Widdowson, 1976). It was to provide an explanation for the evolution of sex differences that Charles Darwin formulated the theory of sexual selection, described first in The Origin of Species (1859) and later, in greater depth, in The Descent of Man (1871). In this chapter, I briefly trace the development of the theory and describe recent attempts to measure variation in reproductive success in males and females, as well as some of the practical problems involved. However, as I argue in the final section, the extent of sexual dimorphism will depend not on the extent to which reproductive success varies in the two sexes but on the comparative effects of particular phenotypic traits on the breeding success of males and females. A brief history of sexual selection The origin of the theory of sexual selection can be traced to a peacock — or, rather, a peahen owned by Lady Tynte. This bird, born around 1762, lived in such comfortable circumstances that it had already reared eight broods when, to the consternation of its noble owner, it suddenly developed the plumage and spurs of a male and thereafter refused to lay another egg. No possible confusion of identities could have occurred since Lady Tynte was able to recognize her favourite by the nobs on its toes, which were unaffected by its change in appearance (Hunter, 1837). It is not known whether Lady Tynte investigated just what had happened to the bird's genitalia but subsequent studies of female pheasants showing similar transvestite tendencies revealed that only sexual differences developing at or after puberty were affected and that the reproductive organs themselves remained unaltered (Yarrell, 1827). This finally led John Hunter, the eminent surgeon, anatomist and classifier of monsters to produce a seminal paper (An account of an extraordinary pheasant,Hunter, 1837) in which he proposed that differences between the sexes were of two kinds: those involving the sexual organs themselves, which were evident from birth and did not change during an individual's lifetime; and those that did not develop until the animal approached breeding age, such as differences in body size, plumage and in the tendency to be fat which he termed ‘secondary’ marks or characters of sex (Hunter, 1837, 1861). Some of these, like the plumage of gallinaceous birds, could change during an individual's lifetime but these differences were not evident at birth. Hunter realized both that ‘secondary’ sexual characters were functionally related to fighting or display and that their extent varied with ecology. Hunter's distinction between primary and secondary sexual characters was adopted by Charles Darwin (1871) with a subtle distinction. Darwin was aware that many ‘secondary’ sex differences were evident at birth (or  hatching) and distinguished between the two categories on functional rather than on ontogenetic grounds. Darwin's primary sexual characters were those connected with the act of reproduction itself while secondary sexual characters were used in acquiring mating partners. To these two categories, Darwin added a third: sex differences ‘related to different habits of life, and not at all, or only indirectly, to the reproductive functions’, among which he included structures associated with sex differences in feeding behaviour (Darwin, 1871). The theory of sexual selection was intended to provide an explanation only of secondary sexual characteristics. Darwin realized that many secondary sexual differences were a consequence of the greater intensity of competition between males for access to mates and that many traits were more highly developed in males either because they conferred an advantage in fights or because they rendered their possessor more attractive to females. He distinguished sexual selection from natural selection on two grounds:. first, that it was a consequence of competition between members of the same sex rather than between members of different sexes or species; and, second, that it depended on variation in reproductive success rather than survival. ‘…This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring.’ Darwin's theory of sexual selection was less readily accepted by scientists than the theory of natural selection. Wallace (1889) agreed that combat between males was an important source of selection pressures leading to sexual dimorphism but regarded this as a form of natural selection on the grounds that it increased ‘the vigour and fighting power of the male animal, since, in every case, the weaker are either killed, wounded or driven away’. He regarded Darwin's second mode of sexual selection — female choice of particular males — as unimportant on the grounds that any consequences which female choice might have would be annulled by natural selection — unless females selected the fittest males, in which case the results of sexual and natural selection would be inseparable. He also  pointed to the lack of evidence of consistent female choice for mates carrying particular characteristics. Some fifty years later, the same points were reaffirmed in two influential papers by Huxley (1938a, b). Wallace's objection that sexual selection is a form of natural selection is semantically correct — after all, Darwin originally coined the term ‘natural selection’ in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection, and the opposite of natural selection is not sexual but artificial selection (see Brown, 1975; Halliday, 1978). However, his insistence that the process of sexual selection described by Darwin could only increase the average reproductive success or survival of males is clearly wrong (Lande, 1980). Especially in polygynous species, the costs of combat are frequently high (Geist, 1971; Clutton-Brock, Albon, Gibson & Guinness, 1979) and so, too are the costs of many sexually dimorphic characters associated with combat, such as increased male body size and weapon development (Clutton-Brock, Guinness & Albon, 1982): in species where males are substantially larger than females, both growing and adult males are often more likely to die than females (Robinette, Gashwiler, Low & Jones, 1957; Grubb, 1974; Howe, 1977) and in one reindeer population which crashed from 6000 to 42, only one of the remaining adults was a male (Klein, 1968). Sexual selection on males may also reduce the average fitness of females (Lande, 1980): in species where adult males are substantially larger than females, producing sons appears to depress the mother's subsequent reproductive success more than producing daughters (Clutton-Brock, Albon & Guinness, 1981). Wallace's theoretical objections to the importance of female choice as a source of sexual selection on males can also be discounted. R. A. Fisher (1930) demonstrated that female choice for particular male characteristics (such as tail size) can cause them to develop to a point at which they reduce the average fitness of males. Subsequent treatments have confirmed Fisher's conclusions (O'Donald, 1980; Lande, 1981) and shown that the process need not depend on the initial female preference favouring more viable males (Kirkpatrick, 1982). However, while there is extensive evidence of assortative mating (O'Donald, 1980), of the importance of plumage characteristics in courtship (Williams, 1982) and of female preference for males who can defend superior breeding territories (Pleszczynska, 1978) only very recently has it been demonstrated that consistent female choice for any continuous morphological character in males is an important source of variation in male reproductive success. By experimental manipulation of tail length in widdow birds of the African genus Euplectes , Andersson has been able to alter both the extent to which  males are favoured by females and their mating success (Andersson, 1982). This scarcity of evidence does not mean that the evolution of secondary sexual characters through female choice is uncommon, for mating preferences are usually difficult to demonstrate, particularly where inter-male competition is also involved. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that, as Wallace argued, many of the sex differences in plumage and coloration ascribed by Darwin to the action of female choice may have evolved because they help the sexes to recognize or locate each other or because they improve male success in competitive interactions. Measures of sexual selection Darwin was not specific as to why males should typically compete more strongly for access to breeding partners than females and it was left to biologists of this century to provide the answer (Fisher, 1930; Bateman, 1948; Trivers, 1972). The reason why males usually compete more intensely is most easily understood by considering the energetic costs of reproduction to each sex. In most animals, the energetic costs of fertilization to the male are minimal whereas the costs of reproduction to the female are substantial. Consequently, males are capable of fathering more progeny than females can bear and rear: in current terminology (Trivers, 1972) they invest less heavily in their offspring than females. In species where successful males can monopolize breeding access to large numbers of females but similar numbers of males and females are recruited, direct competition between males is likely to be intense, aggressive interactions may be frequent and the selective advantages of possessing traits that affect success in combat may be higher among males than among females. However, neither Trivers' explanation of the prevalence of increased competition among males nor Darwin's description of the theory of sexual selection provide an operational definition of the intensity of sexual selection (Wade, 1979). Many different definitions of sexual selection have been proposed but two kinds are in common use. First, some workers argue that the intensity of sexual selection will depend on the relative variability of reproductive success among males and females. For example, Ralls (1977) argues that ‘the intensity of intrasexual selection in a species should be proportional to the ratio of the lifetime number of offspring sired by a highly successful male compared to the number born by a highly successful female in her lifetime’ while Payne (1979) suggests that the extent to which variance in breeding success differs between the sexes is important. This position is also sometimes mistakenly attributed to Bateman (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). In contrast, other workers use measures of the extent to which male breeding success deviates from mean male success as estimates of the intensity of sexual selection on males (see Wade, 1979; Howard, 1979; Wade & Arnold, 1980). Similarly, the intensity of sexual selection in females can be estimated by measuring the extent to which female breeding success deviates from mean female success. Several statistical measures are in use, including the coefficient of variation, Pielou's (1969) index of evenness and variance in breeding success divided by the square of mean breeding success — a measure derived from Crow's (1958) index of the intensity of selection, where V is variance in fitness and W is the mean fitness of the population. This can either be calculated using total variance in breeding success or using only variance attributable to differences in the number of mates per individual (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). Ratios of variation in male and female success can be used to estimate the relative rate at which male and female characteristics can change. However, since the extent of variation among females differs widely between species (see below), they are of limited value as measures of the comparative intensity of sexual selection (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). The three measures of the extent to which reproductive success varies within each sex are fundamentally similar though the last is the most convenient since it offers a measure of the potential change in fitness between generations, relative to the average (see Crow, 1958). It is still necessary to decide whether to use total variation in breeding success in any calculation or just variation due to differences in mate number. Where the aim of the calculations is to estimate the potential rate of genetic change, total variance in breeding success is clearly the relevant measure to use. In contrast, where calculations are carried out to assess the comparative importance of differences in reproductive success versus survival for each sex, only variation in mate number may be included (see Wade & Arnold, 1980)— though measures of the intensity of sexual selection as conceived by Darwin should also include variation due to differences in mate quality, which may be an important cause of variation in lifetime breeding success both among males and females in monogamous species. Lastly, where the aim is to investigate the functional significance of particular phenotypic sex differences, it may be necessary to calculate  selection intensities for specific episodes of selection, such as mating success at particular ages (see Arnold & Wade, 1983) for the effect of particular traits on lifetime reproductive success may often be obscured by the influence of other variables or by random variation. One general point concerning all indices of sexual selection must be emphasized. Since many of the traits affecting breeding success are strongly influenced by rearing conditions (see Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982), these measures reflect the potential rate of genetic change and may provide little indication of actual rates of change in established populations. Practical problems Although it is relatively easy to decide how the intensity of sexual selection should be estimated, collecting the relevant data poses a variety of logistic problems (Ralls, 1977; Davies, 1982). In particular, in many polygynous species a proportion of males avoid competing directly with larger or older animals and adopt a policy of surreptitious fertilization or kleptogamy (e.g. Clutton-Brock et al ., 1977; Wirtz, 1982). As a result, it is often difficult to be sure that breeding males fertilize all the females in the groups that they guard: for example, even if territorial male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus ) are vasectomized, their females sometimes lay fertile eggs (Bray, Kennelly & Guarino, 1975). Moreover, all indices of the intensity of sexual selection beg a problem of fundamental importance: over what period should reproductive success be measured? It is widely agreed that the lifetime reproductive success of individuals is the most satisfactory measure of fitness that it is usually possible to collect (see Falconer, 1960; Cavalli-Sforza & Bodmer, 1961; Maynard Smith, 1969; Grafen, 1982). This may not always be the case — for example, in rapidly expanding populations, selection may favour reproductive rate at the expense of lifetime reproductive success (see Lewontin, 1965; Elliot, 1975)— but exceptions are probably rare, especially in long-lived species where variation in longevity greatly exceeds variation in age at first breeding. While many studies of sexual selection pay lip service to the importance of basing calculations on measures of lifetime success, most use estimates of success calculated over a part of the animal's lifespan. The time dimension used varies widely: some studies use measures of instantaneous reproductive success (IRS) calculated across different classes of males at a particular point in time (e.g. Mason, 1964; Scheiring, 1977; McCauley g&, 1980), while others measure dally reproductive success (DRS) or  seasonal reproductive success (SRS)(see Howard, 1979; Payne, 1979). Very recently, estimates of individual variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) have become available from field studies of a small number of species, including a territorial and promiscuous invertebrate, the dragonfly Erythemis simplicicolis (McVey, 1981), two monogamous birds, the great tit,Parus major (McGregor, Krebs & Perrins, 1981) and the kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (J. Coulson & C. Thomas, personal communication), and one polygynous mammal, the red deer,Cervus elaphus (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982) while in several other species, including sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus : Wiley, 1973) estimates of individual success are available which span several breeding seasons. These make it possible, for the first time, to test the extent to which variation in instantaneous, dally and seasonal reproductive success reflect variation in lifetime success. There appears to be no consistent relationship between variation in IRS, DRS, SRS and LRS (see Table 23. 1). There are several reasons why variation in daily reproductive success may not reflect variation in either seasonal or lifetime success. In many polygynous species reproductive success varies from hour to hour and day to day and this may cause variation in IRS or DRS to overestimate variation in SRS and LRS. For example, red deer stags which hold a large harem in a sheltered site on one day may have few or no hinds the next day if the wind changes (see Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). As a result, measures of variation in DRS overestimate SRS and LRS in red deer (see Table 23.2). Estimates of variation in DRS and SRS in sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus ) show the same trend though estimates of variation in DRS and LRS were similar in McVey's (1981) study of dragonflies. In addition, variation in SRS will not reflect variation in LRS (see Gadgil, 1972) if individuals that breed successfully show reduced success in future or are likely to cease breeding or die earlier than less successful breeders. There is evidence that successful reproduction reduces the future reproductive capabilities or survival of females in several species (e.g. Wooller & Coulson, 1977; Altmann, Altmann & Hausfater, 1978; Guinness, Albon & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Bryant, 1979) and in some species successful males are likely to die before unsuccessful ones (Geist, 1971). However, several other studies have shown that successful breeders live longer (Drosophila melanogaster : Partridge & Farquhar, 198 1). For example, in red deer stags, where harem size is one of the principal determinants of reproductive success (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1979, 1982), not only do stags that hold large harems hold them for longer within particular breeding  seasons than those which hold smaller harems (Fig. 23. 1a), but individuals that are consistently successful in securing large harems throughout their lives tend to live longer than their less successful competitors (Fig. 23.1b). Trends of this kind will produce an opposite bias and may cause variation in SRS to underestimate variation in LRS. For example, the fighting ability and reproductive success of red deer stags shows a pronounced peak between the ages of seven and ten years (see Fig. 23,2). If variation in breeding success is calculated for stags of above a year old (the age of sexual maturity), it greatly exceeds more realistic measures of variation in breeding success such as variation in seasonal success within cohorts or lifetime success (see Table 23.3). This effect will also tend to overestimate variation in male success relative to variation in female success (see Fig. 23.2). A final problem is that unless breeding success is measured across the lifetime, a biased set of males may be sampled. Especially in polygynous species, males that fail to win a breeding territory spend their time on the fringes of the breeding population and often show high mortality. The field observer approaching a breeding colony is likely to see mostly (if not only) breeding males. If he calculates the extent to which reproductive success varies across adults that have managed to gain a breeding territory, he will underestimate the real variance since he will exclude non-breeders. Dividing by the mean success of males in this sample will accentuate this error since the mean success of the males sampled will be higher than that of the male population as a whole. Table 23.4 shows how the restriction of the sample to harem holding males in red deer reduces estimates of daily variation in the number of females held. Estimates that are probably biased in this way are already widespread in the literature (see Trivers, 1976;, Arnold & Wade, 1983). None of these four biases are likely to be consistent either across the two sexes or across different species: all four are more likely to affect estimates of variation in male success than estimates of variation in female success in polygynous species, though in contrary directions. Ignoring short term variation and age effects will tend to overestimate variation in male success relative to variation in female success, which is usually less strongly age-dependent in polygynous species (see Fig. 23.2) and less likely to vary widely from day to day. Conversely, positive correlations between seasonal success and longevity or sampling only successful males will lead to underestimates of variation in male success relative to variation in female success. That the two sets of biases oppose each other is no guarantee that short term measures of reproductive success will provide reliable estimates of variation in lifetime success for the comparative strengths of the different biases probably vary widely too. Moreover, sex differences in the length of effective reproductive lifespans and in the influence of age on breeding success are likely to be more pronounced in polygynous species than in monogamous ones. As a result, short-term estimates of variation in male breeding success are likely to overestimate the extent to which male success varies in polygynous species relative to similar measures for monogamous ones. Biased estimates of variation in reproductive success may also cause the effects of particular phenotypic traits on reproductive success to be overestimated. This applies particularly to traits, such as body size, which are themselves related to age. For example, where the body size and reproductive success of males both increase with age, the effects of size on breeding success may be grossly exaggerated if age differences in size are ignored. This effect is again likely to be stronger in males than females. The most obvious conclusion to be drawn is the need for studies of the extent to which lifetime success varies and of the factors which affect it. Where this is impossible, an alternative approach is to concentrate on studies of variation in breeding success within cohorts but, even here, problems will arise if breeding success is consistently related to longevity. Polygyny, reproductive success and sexual dimorphism The theory of sexual selection has led to four common predictions about the relationship between breeding success and sexual dimorphism. Variation in reproductive success should be greater in males than females in polygynous species but similar in the two sexes in monogamous ones. Both in red deer and in Erythemis , variation in lifetime breeding success is substantially greater among males than females whereas, in kittiwakes, variation is similar in both sexes (Figs. 23.3, 23.4). When the red deer   samples are restricted to animals that reach breeding age, sex differences in the extent to which breeding success varies are accentuated (Table 23.5). Considering that male red deer can hold harems of over thirty hinds, it is, perhaps, surprising that male success does not vary more widely. This is partly because only a proportion of hinds conceive in a given year and individual stags rarely hold harems throughout the whole breeding season, and partly because few stags breed successfully for more than four years. In contrast, the range of breeding success among hinds is greater than might be expected because their potential breeding lifespans are long (over 12 years) and individuals tend to be either consistently successful or consistently unsuccessful breeders. Variation in reproductive success should be greater among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones. One surprising result of the comparison between red deer and kittiwakes is that variation in lifetime breeding success is little greater in red deer stags than in male kittiwakes (see Table 23.5): in fact if all individuals born/hatched are included, it is slightly (though not significantly) greater in male kittiwakes. The comparison is an unsatisfactory one since there are important differences in the life histories of the two species: male kittiwakes can breed for many more seasons, adult mortality is not so strongly age-dependent and females can fledge up to three young per year (see Coulson, 1966, 1968; Coulson & Wooller, 1976; Wooller & Coulson, 1977). However, this example serves to emphasize how misleading it can be to assume that the breeding sex ratio necessarily reflects the extent to which male reproductive success varies for, even among closely related species, it is likely to be the case that males have substantially longer breeding lifespans in monogamous species than in polygynous ones (see Wiley, 1974; Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). Direct competition for mates will be more intense among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones. Fights between males can be common and dangerous in polygynous species (see Geist, 1971). However, competition between males can also be intense in monogamous species (Lack, 1954; Kleiman, 1977) and data are not yet available which would permit a meaningful comparison between the two groups of species. In fact, it is unsafe to assume that the intensity of direct competition  between males should necessarily be reduced in monogamous species. Though variation in male success may be caused principally by differences in mate or territory quality (whereas, in polygynous species, differences in mate number are the main cause of differences in success: Bateman, 1948; Wade, 1979; Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982), monogamous males might be expected to compete as intensely for the best mates or territories as do polygynous males for the biggest harems. Where this is not the case, it may be because males cannot identify the breeding potential of young females or because female choice pre-empts male competition rather than because variation in success is slight among males. Sexual dimorphism will be most developed among strongly polygynous species and least developed among monogamous ones. In many different groups of animals there is an association between polygyny and sexual dimorphism and Darwin himself was well aware of the relationship. More recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated statistical relationships between the degree of polygyny and the development of sexual dimorphism, though the relationship is not always a close one (Ralls, 1977). Compared to monogamous species, polygynous ones usually show greater sexual dimorphism in body size (Clutton-Brock, Harvey & Rudder, 1977; Shine, 1979; Alexander et al ., 1979) while weapons used in intraspecific combat, such as the canines of primates and the antlers of deer, are also more developed in the males of polygynous species (Harvey, Kavanagh & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Clutton-Brock, Albon & Harvey, 1980). However, there are many exceptions (Ralls, 1977). In some groups of animals, the relationship between the extent of polygyny and the degree of sexual dimorphism is not a close one (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1977). In addition, some polygynous species, like Burchell's zebra (Equus burchelli ), show little or no size dimorphism while others, like the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ) and the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli ), even show reversed dimorphism (Klingel, 1972; Kruuk, 1972; Stirling, 1969). While it is possible that some of these exceptions result from the differing energetic requirements of males and females and attendant selection pressures affecting the relative size of the two sexes (Selander, 1972; Downhower, 1976), the common association between sex differences in size and the development of male weaponry suggests that selection pressures associated with breeding competition are frequently involved. To interpret exceptions to the general rule that sexual dimorphism increases with the degree of polygyny, we need to remember that it is the comparative effects of phenotypic traits on reproductive success in males and females that will determine the degree of dimorphism and not the amount of variation in reproductive success per se (see Price, 1970; Lande, 1980). For example, while sexual dimorphism in size is likely to evolve where variation in male success is greater than female success and a given increment in body size has the same effect on breeding success in both sexes, it will also evolve if variation in reproductive success is similar in both sexes but size has a greater influence on success in males or even if variation in success is greater in females but the effects of size are greater among males. Conversely, sexual dimorphism in size is unlikely to evolve in circumstances where variation in reproductive success is greater among males but the effects of size on reproductive success are slight in both sexes. In the simplest of all possible worlds sexual dimorphism should, perhaps, be predicted by the relative slope of lifetime reproductive success on body size in males and females. However, there is no reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will be linear or that they will follow a similar pattern in both sexes. Indeed, where size differences are heritable and stabilizing selection is operating, there is every reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will not be linear. In addition, even a knowledge of the relationship between body size and lifetime reproductive success in the two sexes will not answer whether the association occurs for reasons connected with breeding competition or because the two sexes differ in their energy requirements (see Downhower, 1976). To sort out these questions, it will be necessary to identify the particular episodes of selection during which size influences breeding success in males and females (see Arnold & Wade, 1983). This argument raises the question of why it is that sexual dimorphism and polygyny are related at all. The most likely explanation is that the factors determining breeding success in males and females tend to be most similar in monogamous species and most different in highly polygynous ones. The factors affecting breeding success in males and females certainly differ widely in polygynous species. For example, in red deer, longevity, offspring survival and home range quality have a greater effect on the reproductive success of hinds than on that of stags. In contrast, fighting ability, body size and (because of its effect on adult size) early growth have  a more important effect on the reproductive success of stags than hinds (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). The factors affecting lifetime success in males and females of monogamous species have yet to be described. While it is clear that they will not be identical (see McGregor et al ., 1981), it is reasonable to suppose that, especially among species that pair for life, they are likely to be more similar than in polygynous species. Selection pressures on males and females Emphasis on the importance of understanding the factors affecting breeding success in males and females has the advantage that it forces us to ask specific comparative questions concerning the functional significance of particular sex differences. For example, does body size have a less important effect on the reproductive success of male zebras than male bovids because zebras fight with their teeth and hooves rather than by pushing? Similarly, does size have a greater effect on reproductive success in female Weddell seals compared to land or pack-ice breeding species because they breed on fast ice and defend access to water holes? Conversely, is body size less important in male Weddells compared to other species because they defend underwater territories where success depends on manoeuvrability and because females are widely dispersed? Thinking in these terms may help us to understand the distribution of many other sex differences. For example, among hermaphroditic reef fish, some species begin life as females and a proportion of individuals later become males (protogyny)(Warner, Robertson & Leigh, 1975; Robertson & Hoffman, 1977). But in a few species, such as the clown fishes (Amphiprion ), individuals start life as males and a proportion later become females (protandry)(Fricke & Fricke, 1977). The females of most protogynous species spawn on the edge of the reef, releasing their eggs into the plankton, and seldom compete for spawning sites. In contrast, female clownfish lay their eggs around sea anemones which they subsequently help to defend. Does resource defence by females again increase the benefits of large body size to female clownfish while reducing the benefits of size to males as a consequence of female dispersion? Understanding the comparative effects of size may even help to explain variation in birth sex ratios. It has been suggested that in species where reproductive success varies more widely among males than females and is influenced by parental investment, parents who can afford to invest heavily in their offspring should produce sons while those that cannot do so should tend to produce daughters (Trivers & Willard, 1973). In apparent  contradiction to the theory, dominant female baboons and macaques produce more daughters than sons while subordinates produce more sons than daughters (Altmann, 1980; Simpson & Simpson, 1982). One possible explanation is that even though reproductive success probably varies more widely among males in these species, maternal rank has a stronger effect on the success of daughters since females remain in their mother's troop and inherit her rank while sons disperse to other groups and may be unable to benefit substantially from their mother's rank (Altmann, 1980). Perhaps most importantly, emphasis on examining the effects of particular traits on the breeding success of males and females should encourage us to investigate the adaptive significance of sex differences whose functions are not immediately obvious. For example, in many mammals growing males lay down less body fat than females (Glucksman, 1974) and suffer heavier mortality during periods of food shortage as a consequence (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). One possible explanation is that because early growth exerts a greater effect on reproductive success in males than females (see above), selection favours increased investment by young males in growth at the expense of laying down body fat to assure survival during periods of food shortage. This prompts the question as to whether young females lay down less fat in species showing reversed size dimorphism. Recent research shows that this is the case in at least one species belonging to this category (the European sparrow hawk: I. Newton, personal communication). These explanations are cautiously worded — and necessarily so, for our current knowledge of the factors affecting reproductive success in males and females is rudimentary. Nevertheless, the way ahead is clear. If we wish to fulfil Charles Darwin's ambition of understanding the reasons for the distribution of differences between the sexes, we shall need to examine the causes of variation in lifetime breeding success among males and females in natural populations."
ACA ACA-CTY-001 -0.02 "White Mythologies t If so-called ‘so-called poststructuralism’ is the product of a single historical moment, then that moment is probably not May 1968 but rather the Algerian War of Independence — no doubt itself both a symptom and a product. In this respect it is significant that Sartre, Althusser, Derrida and Lyotard, among others, were all either born in Algeria or personally involved with the events of the war. But let us begin instead with Héléne Cixous's remarkable account of what it was like to grow up as an Algerian French Jewish girl at that time: I learned everything from this first spectacle: I saw how the white (French), superior, plutocratic, civilized world founded its power on the repression of populations who had suddenly become ‘invisible’, like proletarians, immigrant workers, minorities who are not the right ‘colour’. Women. Invisible as humans. But, of course, perceived as tools — dirty, stupid, lazy, underhanded, etc. Thanks to some annihilating dialectical magic. I saw that the great, noble, ‘advanced’ countries established themselves by expelling what was ‘strange’; excluding it but not dismissing it; enslaving it. A commonplace gesture of History: there have to be two races — the masters and the slaves. Cixous has been criticized for lacking a politics and a theory of the social. According to some criteria perhaps, but if so they would have to exclude from ‘the political, considerations such as those described here. Which is precisely the point: if there is a politics to what has become known as poststructuralism, then it is articulated in this passage which unnervingly weaves capitalist economic exploitation, racism, colonialism, sexism, together with, perhaps unexpectedly, ‘History’ and the structure of the Hegelian dialectic. A lot has been said already in the English-speaking world about poststructuralism and politics, much of it in the accusatory mode voiced from the opposing class-based verities of ‘tradition’ or ‘History’. Such apparently secure grounds of objection amount to two narratives; their intriguing similarity brings out the extent to which poststructuralism challenges not  just the politics and institutions of the right but also the politics and theoretical systems of the left. Disturbing conventional assumptions about what constitutes ‘the political’, poststructuralism is correspondingly difficult to place itself. In the passage just cited for example it is striking that Cixous includes the Hegelian dialectic in the forms of political oppression which she describes. It is not a question of showing that such an allegation misinterprets or simplifies Hegel's texts. Of course it does. The problem involves rather the ways in which Hegel has been read, absorbed and adapted. Nor is it just the Hegelian dialectic as such: Cixous includes ‘History’, and by implication therefore Marxism as well. This cannot simply be dismissed as another New Right invocation of the Gulag, for Cixous is arguing something much more specific: that Marxism, insofar as it inherits the system of the Hegelian dialectic, is also implicated in the link between the structures of knowledge and the forms of oppression of the last two hundred years: a phenomenon that has become known as Eurocentrism. To this extent, Marxism's universalizing narrative of the unfolding of a rational system of world history is simply a negative form of the history of European imperialism: it was Hegel, after all, who declared that ‘Africa has no history’, and it was Marx who, though critical of British imperialism, concluded that the British colonization of India was ultimately for the best because it brought India into the evolutionary narrative of Western history, thus creating the conditions for future class struggle there. Such an arrogant and arrogating narrative means that the story of ‘world history’ not only involves what Fredric Jameson describes as the wresting of freedom from the realm of necessity but always also the creation, subjection and final appropriation of Europe's ‘others’. This is why ‘History’, which for Marxism promises liberation, for Cixous also entails another forgotten story of oppression: Already I know all about the ‘reality’ that supports History's progress: everything throughout the centuries depends on the distinction between the Selfsame, the ownself…and that which limits it: so now what menaces my-own-good…is the ‘other’. What is the ‘Other’? If it is truly the ‘other’, there is nothing to say; it cannot be theorized. The ‘other’ escapes me. It is elsewhere, outside: absolutely other. It doesn't settle down. But in History, of course, what is called, other' is an alterity that does settle down, that falls into the dialectical circle. It is the other in a hierarchically organized relationship in which the same is what rules, names, defines, and assigns ‘its’ other. With the dreadful simplicity that orders the movement Hegel erected as a system, society trots along before my eyes reproducing to perfection the mechanism of the death struggle: the reduction of a ‘person, to a ‘nobody’ to the position of ‘other’— the inexorable plot of racism. There has to be some ‘other’— no master  without a slave, no economico-political power without exploitation, no dominant class without cattle under the yoke, no ‘Frenchmen’ without wogs, no Nazis without Jews, no property without exclusion — an exclusion that has its limits and is part of the dialectic. (70–1) Not that Hegel himself is responsible. Rather the problem, Cixous argues, is that unfortunately Hegel wasn't inventing things. The entire Hegelian machinery simply lays down the operation of a system already in place, already operating in everyday life. Politics and knowledge have worked according to the same Hegelian dialectic, with its ‘phallo-logocentric Aufhebung ’— whether it be Marxism's History, Europe's colonial annexations and accompanying racism or orientalist scholarship, or, in a typical conflation of patriarchy and colonialism, Freud's characterization of femininity as the dark unexplored continent (’ within his economy, she is the strangeness he likes to appropriate' [68]). For even Freud, according to Cixous, has not helped in any project to separate history from the history of appropriation or that of phallocentrism. The patriarchal structures of psychoanalytic theory have often been defended on the grounds that they only describe the current customs of a patriarchal society. But this does not alter the fact that psychoanalysis therefore repeats the same masculine ‘Empire of the Selfsame’, and that as soon as such descriptions become institutionalized — as a structure of knowledge, or as psychoanalytic practice — then they become agents of the system they describe. The point is to change it. But why this emphasis on Hegel? The problem of the Hegelian model, particularly of a historicism which presupposes a governing structure of self-realization in all historical process, is by no means confined to post-war French Marxism, but the dominance of Hegelian Marxism from the thirties to the fifties does explain the particular context for the French poststructuralist assault. Here it is not a question of suggesting that Hegel is somehow answerable for the excesses of capitalism or even socialism in the past two hundred years: rather what is at stake is the argument that the dominant force of opposition to capitalism, Marxism, as a body of knowledge itself remains complicit with, and even extends, the system to which it is opposed. Hegel articulates a philosophical structure of the appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge which uncannily simulates the project of nineteenth-century imperialism; the construction of knowledges which all operate through forms of expropriation and incorporation of the other mimics it a conceptual level the geographical and economic absorption of the non-European world by the West. Marxism's standing Hegel on his head may have reversed his idealism, but it did not change the mode of operation of a conceptual system which remains collusively Eurocentric. It is thus entirely appropriate that Hegelian Marxism has become generally known as ‘Western Marxism’. As Cixous suggests, the mode of knowledge as a politics of arrogation  pivots at a theoretical level on the dialectic of the same and the other. Such knowledge is always centred in a self even though it is outward looking, searching for power and control of what is other to it. Anthropology has always provided the clearest symptomatic instance, as was foreseen by Rousseau from the outset. History, with a capital H, similarly cannot tolerate otherness or leave it outside its economy of inclusion. The appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge within a totalizing system can thus be set alongside the history (if not the project) of European imperialism, and the constitution of the other as ‘other’ alongside racism and sexism. The reaction against this structure has produced forms of politics that do not fit into traditional political categories. Here the problem rests on the fact that for orthodox Marxism there can be only one ‘other’, that of the working class, into which all other oppressed groups, so-called ‘minorities’, must in the last instance be subsumed. Such a position is by no means confined to a Marxism of a Stalinist past. In Making History , published in 1987, for example, Alex Callinicos argues that the so-called poststructuralist critique of the category of the subject can be avoided by shifting the subject out of the problematic realm of consciousness into a theory of human agency. This provides something closer to historical Marxism, although it does mean that he quickly becomes involved in assumptions about rationality and intentionality, and has to propose a ‘principle of Humanity’, that is a common human nature, to hold them all together. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the ‘Principle of Humanity’ also turns out to involve the assumption that class is the primary form of collective agency, because, we are told, it is more fundamental than any other interests or forms of social power. Callinicos writes: Feminists and black nationalists [sic]often complain that the concepts of Marxist class theory are ‘gender-blind’ and ‘race-blind’. This is indeed true. Agents' class position derives from their place in production relations, not their gender or supposed race. But of itself this does not provide grounds for rejecting Marxism, since its chief theoretical claim is precisely to explain power-relations and forms of conflict such as those denoted by the terms ‘nation’, ‘gender’ and ‘race’in terms of the forces and relations of production. The mere existence of national, sexual and racial oppression does not refute historical materialism, but rather constitutes its explanandum . The only interesting question is whether or not Marxism can actually explain these phenomena. The only interesting question? So as long as gender and race can be satisfactorily subordinated to class then Marxism does not need refuting, and history can be reasserted as the single narrative of the Third International. Conversely, as Callinicos implicitly recognizes, the problem with  contemporary politics for the left is that the dialectic of class depends on a historicist History and vice versa; any failure of the former necessarily also involves a waning of the latter. Marxism's inability to deal with the political interventions of other oppositional groups has meant that its History can no longer claim to subsume all processes of change. The straightforward oppositional structure of capital and class does not necessarily work any more: if we think in terms of Hegel's master/slave dialectic, then rather than the working class being the obvious universal subject-victim, many others are also oppressed: particularly women, black people, and all other so-called ethnic and minority groups. Any single individual may belong to several of these, but the forms of oppression, as of resistance or change, may not only overlap but may also differ or even conflict. As soon as there is no longer a single master and no single slave, then the classic Hegelian reversal model on which Marxism depends and on which it bases its theory of revolution (literally, an overturning) is no longer adequate. In fact it is arguable whether such dualistic conditions ever existed anyway: marginal groups which could not be assimilated into the category of the working class were merely relegated by Marx to the Lumpenproletariat . Even the formulation of a dualistic class division, Laclau and Mouffe have argued persuasively, is itself nothing less than a nostalgic attempt to recreate for the nineteenth century the imagined simplicity of the conditions of the aristocracy/bourgeoisie conflict of the French Revolution which had originally inspired Hegel. A similarly straightforward opposition also provides much of the attraction which has fuelled the recent growth of interest in the historical analysis of colonialism — in which you apparently have the simple binary of master and slave, colonizer and colonized. With colonialism it's easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys, which makes it tempting to substitute the colonized for the lost working class. Already in 1957 Roland Barthes was claiming that ‘today it is the colonized peoples who assume the full ethical and political condition described by Marx as being that of the proletariat’. But politics today are much more complex, much more difficult to disentangle. The dialectical structure of oppositional politics no longer works for the micro-politics of the post-war period in the West. This is the context of Foucault's critique of what he calls the sovereign model of power, of the idea that power has a single source in a master, king, or class — and can thus easily be reversed. This shift from a conflictual dyadic political structure is not simply a question of historical change, of the recent appearance of ‘minorities’: after all the slave was already constituted simultaneously according to different groups (for example male or female), the Lumpenproletariat always had to be excluded. The problem begins at a conceptual level with the initial division between master and slave as such, as if relations of power work according to the binary opposition of Hegel's fight to the death between two individuals. This structure is not, as might at first be imagined, derived from a fantasy of power relations modelled on a medieval joust but from the phenomenological account of the constitution of knowledge that works according to the structure of a subject perceiving an object, a same/other dialectic in which the other is first constituted by the same through its negation as other before being incorporated within it. No possibility of dialogue or exchange here. As Cixous argues, nor can there be any place in this schema for the other as other, unless it becomes, like God, an absolute other, literally unknowable. The difficulties which arise from this structure are familiar from the debates in feminism, where, woman, seems to be offered an alternative of either being the ‘other’ as constituted by man, that is, conforming to the stereotypes of patriarchy, or, if she is to avoid this, of being an absolute ‘other’outside knowledge, necessarily confined to inarticulate expressions of mysticism or jouissance . The only way to side-step these alternatives seems to be to reject the other altogether and become the same, that is, equal to men — but then with no difference from them. Exactly the same double bind is encountered in any theorization of racial difference. In his influential Le Même et l'autre Vincent Descombes has described the entire history of twentieth-century philosophy in France as a succession of moves which attempt to get out of this Hegelian dialectic: the recent phenomenon of poststructuralism is part of a long philosophical story and distinguished only by what appears to be a certain success, or at least an avoidance of failure to the extent that it has at least managed to keep the game with Hegel in play. The real difficulty has always been to find an alternative to the Hegelian dialectic — difficult because strictly speaking it is impossible, insofar as the operation of the dialectic already includes its negation. You cannot get out of Hegel by simply contradicting him, any more than you can get out of those other Hegelian systems, Marxism and psychoanalysis, by simply opposing them: for in both your opposition is likewise always recuperable, as the workings of ideology or psychic resistance. Nor can you get away from Hegel by simply removing him, like the excision of Trotsky from the side of Lenin in certain official Soviet photographs. This is the lesson of Althusser. Althusser's historical interest derives from the fact that he represents the only orthodox Marxist theorist who has tried to get out of Hegel while remaining a Marxist — though for many Marxists he did sacrifice Marxism in the process, which only suggests how closely Marxism and Hegelianism are intertwined. Althusser's theoretical interest, on the other hand, is that he demonstrates the impossibility of any attempt simply to exclude, excise or extirpate Hegel. Other strategies are required. II HISTORICISM AND IMPERIALISM Metaphysics — the white mythology which reassembles and reflects the culture of the West: the white man takes his own mythology, Indo-European mythology, his own logos , that is, the mythos of his idiom, for the universal form of that he must still wish to call Reason. Jacques Derrida If poststructuralism has involved an attempted disruption or reworking of Hegelianism through the detection of its own fissures, it is not by any means unique in such an enterprise. For, as Foucault argued in 1978, the work of the Frankfurt School could also be regarded as a reassessment of Hegelianism and the metaphysics of dialectical thought. However, it is too simplistic a reaction to suggest that French poststructuralism can therefore be invalidated by judging it against the claims of a comparable endeavour in Germany, a procedure which can only operate by turning the former into a failed version of the latter, which obviously leaves open the possibility of exactly the reverse argument being made. Though the two may have isolated similar problems, the political and intellectual context of their work was by no means the same. The key Frankfurt School text in this regard is obviously Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment of 1944. The date, and the exiled place of composition of its authors, suggests tellingly that the situation with which it attempts to deal is the phenomenon of fascism which seemed to have stopped in its tracks the long march of the progress of reason, and its liberating enlightenment ideals, of which Marxism was the fullest political development. Horkheimer and Adorno therefore pose the question: how has the dialectic deviated into fascism? Why has History gone wrong? Their answer, briefly, was that reason had always contained a measure of irrationality, which, despite its best intentions, had led to its involvement with tyranny and domination: ‘Enlightenment is totalitarian’. The very powers of rationality which enabled modern man to free himself from nature and control it had also become an instrumental device to dominate him. If nature had been modelled by man into productive commodities, man's own subjectivity had also become reified into a self-identical instrument; man had become an empty and passive consumer. The project, therefore, was to return to the enlightenment in the wake of fascism, to excise the forms of instrumental rationality that had produced this self-defeating and, ironically, irrational dialectical structure of domination, and to redefine reason and the forms of identity thinking that had defined the individual simply as an indistinguishable element in the collective. In this way the autonomy and spontaneity of the individual subject that had been the original goal of enlightenment might be retrieved. If for the Frankfurt School the problem to be dealt with was the relation of the phenomena of fascism, and particularly Auschwitz, to the ideals of the enlightenment and the progress of reason, for the French  poststructuralists the historical perspective was similarly long. But it comprised, rather, a history of the West in which fascism was itself merely a symptom, and included not only the history of European imperialism but also the defeats of the European colonial powers by Japan in World War II, the subsequent French (and American) defeat in South-East Asia, the war in Algeria, as well as the many other colonial wars of national liberation. From this point of view the French have never regarded fascism as an aberration, concurring rather with Césaire and Fanon that it can be explained quite simply as European colonialism brought home to Europe by a country that had been deprived of its overseas empire after World War I. French poststructuralism, therefore, involves a critique of reason as a system of domination comparable to that of the Frankfurt School, but rather than setting up the possibility of a purged reason operating in an unblocked, ideal speech situation as a defence against tyranny and coercion in the manner of a Habermas, it reanalyses the operations of reason as such. Here the focus is placed not so much upon the continued presence of irrationality, for irrationality after all is simply reason's own excluded but necessary negative other, but rather on the possibility of other logics being imbricated within reason which might serve to undo its own tendency to domination. Here we have a major difference from the historical pessimism of Adorno's negative dialectics which in certain respects poststructuralism might appear to resemble. Another such project was initiated by Adorno's contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre, whose attempt to define a new form of Hegelian Marxism via a reworked philosophy of consciousness in many ways more closely resembled that of the Frankfurt School. In both cases revisionary work of this kind was embodied in a historical and political analysis of the relation of individual consciousness to society, from within the aegis of an Hegelian Marxism in some respects still impossibly bound to its own enlightenment heritage. This meant that Adorno in particular tended to project science as something exterior and exclusively instrumental; he reacted against it, as well as‘objective’ reason generally, by trying to retrieve the individual subject as the means to salvation. In France, however, there also existed a very different tradition, that of the history of the sciences, a tradition in which Foucault has placed himself. Having been overshadowed since the war by Sartrean Marxism, in the crises of the 1960s it emerged as the more influential of the two. Foucault traces its history back to Husserl's Cartesian Meditations (1929) and the Crisis of the European Sciences (1936)— in which Husserl ‘posed the question of the relations between the ‘Western’ project of a universal deployment of reason,[and]the positivity of the sciences and the radicality of philosophy'. This enabled the establishment of a critical position in relation to science which for Adorno remained so elusive. In larger terms, however, the questions posed in the French tradition were  comparable to those of the Frankfurt School, particularly the interrogation of rationality in its claims to universality. As Foucault puts it: In the history of the sciences in France, as in German critical theory, it is a matter at bottom of examining a reason, the autonomy of whose structures carries with it a history of dogmatism and despotism — a reason, consequently, which can only have an effect of emancipation on condition that it manages to liberate itself from itself. (54) The final emancipatory gesture of enlightenment thought would thus be its own liberation from itself, so that it is no longer recognizable as reason. But what was it that brought about the return of the question of the enlightenment to contemporary philosophical enquiry? Foucault identifies three reasons: first of all the ever-increasing importance of technology, secondly the place of rationalism in the optimism attached to the notion of ‘revolution’— as well as in the despotism that so often followed its realization — and thirdly: the movement which, at the close of the colonial era, led it to be asked of the West what entitles its culture, its science, its social organization, and finally its rationality itself, to be able to claim universal validity: was this not a mirage associated with economic domination and political hegemony? Two centuries later, the Enlightenment returns: but not at all as a way for the West to take cognizance of its present possibilities and of the liberties to which it can have access, but as a way of interrogating it on its limits and on the powers which it has abused. Reason as despotic enlightenment. (54) Foucault's account is particularly useful insofar as it gives a good indication of the characteristic French, as opposed to German, emphasis on the relation of Marxism to enlightenment rationality and the questioning of enlightenment claims to the universality of its values. The first element, the role of science, is common to both, though they approach the question from opposite perspectives. The second, the role of enlightenment thinking in the subsequent history of European despotism, is the particular focus of interest for the German critical theorists, most memorably and most forcibly articulated in Benjamin's ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’. It is the third element, however, which represents the special interest of the French, whether of the Sartrean or Foucauldian tradition: the relation of the enlightenment, its grand projects and universal truth-claims, to the history of European colonialism. This need not necessarily involve a direct analysis of the effects of colonialism as such, but can also consist of a relentless anatomization of the collusive forms of European knowledge. For Foucault this has comprised a vigorous critique of historicism, including Marxist historicism, and its relation to the operations of knowledge and power. It is from this perspective that it becomes possible to understand the basis of the distrust of totalizing systems of knowledge which depend upon theory and  concepts, so characteristic of Foucault or Lyotard, both of whom have been predominantly concerned with the attempt to isolate and foreground singularity as opposed to universality. This quest for the singular, the contingent event which by definition refuses all conceptualization, can clearly be related to the project of constructing a form of knowledge that respects the other without absorbing it into the same. It is in the work of Edward Said that we can find the problematic of historicist forms of knowledge linked most forcibly to the question of European imperialism. He writes: So far as Orientalism in particular and European knowledge of other societies in general have been concerned, historicism meant that one human history uniting humanity either culminated in or was observed from the vantage point of Europe, or the West… What…has never taken place is an epistemological critique at the most fundamental level of the connection between the development of a historicism which has expanded and developed enough to include antithetical attitudes such as ideologies of Western imperialism and critiques of imperialism on the one hand, and on the other, the actual practice of imperialism by which the accumulation of territories and population, the control of economies, and the incorporation and homogenisation of histories are maintained. This was the difficult project of his own book,Orientalism (1978), which we shall later be examining in detail. For the moment let us focus on Said's subsequent point that if Orientalism and anthropology derive from historicism, this is by no means a thing of the past: of more recent sciences, Said singles out in particular that of world history as practised by Braudel, Wallerstein, Anderson and Wolf, which he contends is still derived from the enterprise of Orientalism and its colluding companion anthropology, and which has refused to encounter and to interrogate its own relationship as a discipline to European imperialism. For Said, the problem amounts simply to historicism and, the universalising and self-validating that has been endemic to it': the theories of accumulation on a world scale, or the capitalist world state, or lineages of absolutism depend (a) on the same displaced percipient and historicist observer who had been an Orientalist or colonial traveller three generations ago;(b) they depend also on a homogenising and incorporating world historical scheme that assimilated non-synchronous developments, histories, cultures, and peoples to it; and (c) they block and keep down latent epistemological critiques of the institutional, cultural and disciplinary instruments linking the incorporative practice of world history with partial knowledges like Orientalism on the one hand, and on the other, with continued ‘Western’ hegemony of the non-European, peripheral world. (22) A new type of knowledge, Said contends, must be produced that can analyse plural objects as such rather than offering forms of integrated understanding that simply comprehend them within totalizing schemas. Already across a wide range of different activities he points to advances in the process of ‘breaking up, dissolving and methodologically as well as critically reconceiving the unitary field ruled hitherto by Orientalism, historicism, and what could be called essentialist universalism’. In this last phrase, Said thus links his critique of Orientalism to other critiques, such as those of racism or of patriarchy. The more difficult question remains of what form this new kind of knowledge can take. Here we return to the theoretical problem of how the other can be articulated as such. How can we represent other cultures? asks Said, as Lévi-Strauss had done before him. His own dismissal of deconstruction as a merely textual practice means that he is himself at a loss when faced with the complex conceptual dialectics of the same and the other. As will be demonstrated with respect to Orientalism itself, Said cannot get out of the Hegelian problematic that he articulates, and indeed tends himself to repeat the very processes that he criticizes. His advocacy of an analytic pluralism in itself does not solve, or even address, the conceptual problems. Nevertheless, Said's comments suggest the wider significance of his project. The demise of an orthodox Marxism may have left theory with a sense that everything is now in flux, that the old verities have gone, but it has also involved the important realization, articulated so forcibly by writers such as Foucault or Said, of the deep articulation of knowledge with power. The politics of poststructuralism forces the recognition that all knowledge may be variously contaminated, implicated in its very formal or ‘objective, structures. This means that in particular colonial discourse analysis is not merely a marginal adjunct to more mainstream studies, a specialized activity only for minorities or for historians of imperialism and colonialism, but itself forms the point of questioning of Western knowledge's categories and assumptions. In the same way, Fanon suggests that at the political level the so-called ‘Third World’ constitutes the disruptive term for the European political dialectic of capitalism and socialism. Everyone feels the need nowadays to qualify the term ‘Third World’, stating quite correctly that it should not be taken to imply a homogeneous entity. The inadequateness of the term, however, insofar as it offers a univocal description of an extremely heterogeneous section of the world, also means that a suitable alternative general category cannot by definition be produced. In this situation, abject apologies in some respects remain complicit with the patronizing attitudes from which they attempt to disassociate themselves. For the ‘Third World’ was invented in the context of the 1955 Bandung Conference, on the model of the French Revolution's ‘Third Estate’, and incorporating equally revolutionary ideals of providing a radical alternative to the hegemonic capitalist-socialist power  blocks of the post-war period. The Third World as a term needs to retrieve this lost positive sense — even if today the political order has changed so that to some extent the various forms of Islamic fundamentalism have taken over the role of providing a direct alternative to First and Second World ideologies. ‘Third World’ will, therefore, be used in this book without (further) apology, or scare quotes, as a positive term of radical critique even if it also necessarily signals its negative sense of economic dependency and exploitation. III THE PHILOSOPHICAL ALLERGY Although Said rejects them, and Foucault characteristically does not mention them, the most effective ploys that have recently been played in this project of articulating another form of knowledge, of redefining the basis of knowledge as such, derive from a different although related body of work to that which Foucault describes — namely the phenomenological tradition of Heidegger, Levinas, and Derrida, which, seemingly like all twentieth-century European philosophy, also traces its apparent origins back to Husserl. As we have seen, the fundamental problem concerns the way in which knowledge — and therefore theory, or history — is constituted through the comprehension and incorporation of the other. This has led to a series of attempts to reinscribe a place for, and a relation with, the other as other, outside the sphere of mastery and therefore, logically speaking, both infinite and beyond the scope of knowledge. Emmanuel Levinas, for example, whose career has been long enough to have introduced Husserl to Sartre in the thirties and to have been able to reply to Derrida in the seventies, proposes a rather different critique of such models of knowledge to those which we have encountered so far. According to Levinas, Western philosophy coincides with the disclosure of the other where the other, in manifesting itself as a being, loses its alterity. From its infancy philosophy has been struck with a horror of the other that remains other — with an insurmountable allergy… Hegel's philosophy represents the logical outcome of this underlying allergy of philosophy. Levinas objects to the implicit violence in the process of knowledge which appropriates and sublates the essence of the other into itself. But as we can see, he does not just blame Hegel here, for according to Levinas ontology itself is the problem. Concerned to find a way to allow the other to remain as other, Levinas therefore rejects not only Hegel but Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre also, and abjures ontology altogether. Because ontology involves an ethico-political violence towards the other, always to some degree seen as a threat, Levinas proposes ethics in its place, substituting a respect for the other for a grasping of it, and a theory of desire not as negation and assimilation but as infinite separation. In Totality and Infinity (1961), a book self-consciously written under the shadow of two ‘world’ wars in which Europe, at the limit of its attempt to devour the world, turned in on itself in two violent acts of self-consummation, Levinas questions the accepted relation between morality and politics. It must always, he suggests, be possible to criticize politics from the point of view of the ethical. As Althusser was keen to emphasize, according to Marx morality works simply as a form of ideological control, and Levinas concurs that ‘everyone will readily agree that it is the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality’(21). But, he argues, the placing of politics —‘the art of foreseeing war and of winning it by every means’— before morality overlooks the extent to which war constitutes the philosophical concept of being itself. For being is always defined as the appropriation of either difference into identity, or of identities into a greater order, be it absolute knowledge, History, or the state. For its part, violence involves not just physical force, injuring or annihilating persons, but also interrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they no longer recognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments but their own substance… Not only modern war but every war employs arms that turn against those who wield them. It establishes an order from which no one can keep his distance; nothing henceforth is exterior. (21) War, then, is another form of the appropriation of the other, and underpins all ontological thinking with its violence. Its corollary, or ‘visage’, is the concept of totality, which, as Levinas observes, has dominated Western philosophy in its long history of desire for Unity and the One. Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized. The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself. As Levinas puts it, ‘the idea of truth as a grasp on things must necessarily have a non-metaphorical sense somewhere’. In Western philosophy, when knowledge or theory comprehends the other, then the alterity of the latter vanishes as it becomes part of the same. This ‘ontological imperialism’, Levinas argues, goes back at least to Socrates but can be found as recently as Heidegger. In all cases the other is neutralized as a means of encompassing it: ontology amounts to a philosophy of power, an egotism in which the relation with the other is accomplished through its assimilation into the self. Its political implications are clear enough: Heidegger, with the whole of Western history, takes the relation with the Other as enacted in the destiny of sedentary peoples, the possessors and builders of the earth. Possession is preeminently the form in which the other becomes the same, by becoming mine. (46) Ontology, therefore, though outwardly directed, remains always centred in an incorporating self: ‘this imperialism of the same’, Levinas suggests, ‘is the whole essence of freedom’(87). For freedom is maintained by a self-possession which extends itself to anything that threatens its identity. In this structure European philosophy reduplicates Western foreign policy, where democracy at home is maintained through colonial or neocolonial oppression abroad. Levinas opposes freedom, based on self-interest, to justice, which respects the alterity of the other and can only be proposed through the asymmetry of dialogue. This also implies an interrogation of the imperialism of theory itself. For theory, as a form of knowledge and understanding of the spectator, is constitutively unable to let the other remain outside itself, outside its representation of the panorama which it surveys, in a state of singularity or separation. This will also be true of any concept, because by definition the concept ‘cannot capture the absolutely-other’; and, to the extent that it must invoke a form of generality, of language itself. Any conventional form of understanding must appropriate the other, in an act of violence and reduction. This leads Levinas to denounce the inability of theory, in its drive to comprehension and representation, to do justice to any radical exteriority. But how can we know and respect the other? Is there a means of bridging the gap between knowledge and morality that avoids the problems of Kant's recourse to the aesthetic but also resists Lyotard's argument that the two are simply incommensurable? How can Levinas' ethics work differently from ontology? Against the egotism of the preoccupation of being with itself, he posits a relation of sociality, whereby the self instead of assimilating the other opens itself to it through a relation with it. In the place of the correlation of knowledge with vision and light, the visual metaphor by which the adequation of the idea with the thing has been thought from Plato to Heidegger, Levinas proposes language, which in the form of speech enables a kind of invisible contact between subjects that leaves them both intact. Language, however, should take the form of dialogue: whereas the universality of reason means that it must necessarily renounce all singularity, and whereas language's function in conceptualizing thought is to suppress the other and bring it within the aegis of the same, in dialogue language maintains the distance between the two; ‘their commerce’, as Levinas puts it, ‘is ethical’. Dialogism allows for ‘radical separation, the strangeness of the interlocutors, the revelation of the other to me’(73). The structure of dialogue, moreover, disallows the taking up of any position beyond the  interlocutors from which they can be integrated into a larger totality. The relation between them, therefore, is not oppositional, nor limitrophe, but one of alterity. Dialogue, face to face conversation, maintains a non-symmetrical relation, a separation through speech. In so doing it breaches any totality, including History: To say that the other can remain absolutely other, that he enters only into the relationship of conversation, is to say that history itself, an identification of the same, cannot claim to totalise the same and the other. The absolutely other, whose alterity is overcome in the philosophy of immanence on the allegedly common plane of history, maintains his transcendence in the midst of history. The same is essentially identification within the diverse, or history, or system. It is not I who resist the system, as Kierkegaard thought; it is the other. (40) The thesis of the primacy of History, Levinas argues, forms part of the imperialism of the same. For ‘totalization is accomplished only in history, when the historiographer assimilates all particular existences and punctual moments into the time of universal history, whose chronological order, it is assumed, ‘outlines the plot of being in itself, analogous to nature’(55). If History claims to incorporate the other within a larger impersonal spirit or idea, albeit the ruse of reason, Levinas contends that ‘this alleged integration is cruelty and injustice, that is,[it]ignores the Other’(52). History is the realm of violence and war; it constitutes another form by which the other is appropriated into the same. For the other to remain other it must not derive its meaning from History but must instead have a separate time which differs from historical time. Whereas for Heidegger time and history are the horizon of Being, for Levinas ‘when man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history’(52). Time itself involves the ‘relationship to unattainable alterity’, an absolute past. It is in temporality, in anteriority, that we find an otherness beyond being. Levinas calls the relation in which an infinite distance is maintained from the other ‘metaphysics’. Metaphysics, he writes, ‘transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of the Other by me, is concretely produced as the calling into question of the same by the other, that is, as the ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of knowledge’(43). Metaphysics therefore precedes ontology. Though a troubling term, metaphysics for Levinas names a counter-tradition in philosophy in which the idea of infinity breaches all totality because ‘it is a relationship with a surplus always exterior to the totality ’(22). This surplus is the effect of the radical alterity of the other, whether as ‘face’ or as death, which prevents the totality from being constituted as such. As might be expected, it is the possibility of this absolute otherness, and the ability to excise all violence in the relation with it, which Derrida questions in the first of his discussions of Levinas. Whereas Levinas, like Habermas, posits an authentic language of expression which abhors the distortions of ‘rhetoric’, Derrida argues that such alterity is constituted not through dialogue but rather through the operation of language itself: Levinas' transcendence-as-surplus is therefore redefined as a Derridean supplement. This would mean that there can never be an authentic speech of the other as such, a position which certainly troubles Levinas' fundamental argument. Despite their differences, Derrida's keen interest in Levinas, as Christopher Norris has argued in scrupulously non-Derridean terms, points to ‘the ultimately ethical nature of his enterprise’. The early essay on Levinas, dating from 1964, shows the extent to which Derrida has been implicated in such questions from the first — though,contra Norris, he has always shown that the conditions of ‘writing’ that make ethics possible also makes them impossible. Certain orientations of his work can be affiliated to Levinas' attempt to shift the relation to alterity from an appropriation by the same into its totality to a respect for the other's heterogeneity. Derrida has even described the critique of logocentrism as ‘above all else the search for the ‘other’’. This can be related to the concern in Derrida's work with the politics of feminism and other positions which contest institutional and political appropriation and exclusion. In recent years Levinas has himself articulated more explicitly his account of the relation of the ethical to the political. If there were just two, as in the face-to-face dialogue, then the ethical would preside as the injunction of responsibility for the other. But as soon as there are three, he suggests, then the ethical moves into politics. ‘We can never’, Levinas concedes to Derrida, ‘completely escape from the language of ontology and politics’. But this does not mean that the ethical has to renounce the moral order in the political world of the third person — of justice, of government, institutions, or the law. The political can retain an ethical foundation: Levinas finds his example for this, unexpectedly, in Marx's famous comment on idealist philosophers — that the point is not to describe the world but to change it: In Marx's critique we find an ethical conscience cutting through the ontological identification of truth with an ideal intelligibility and demanding that theory be converted into a concrete praxis of concern for the other. From this perspective Levinas proposes the possibility that the much lamented ‘subject’ be brought back not as the ontological subject which seeks to reduce everything to itself but as an ethical subject defined in relation to the other: ‘Ethics redefines subjectivity as this heteronomous responsibility in contrast to autonomous freedom’. We might compare this ethical relation to Cixous' remarks about the need to love the other or Kristeva's recent preoccupation with love which, from this perspective, hardly involves the sudden apostasy of which she has been  accused, but rather as for Levinas consists of a way of formulating a ‘responsibility for the Other, being-for-the-other’. In each case these writers can be shown to be trying to place the other outside the sphere of mastery rather than in a relation of negation or of reduplication of the self. Unlike a conventional ethics of altruism, such a relation remains one of alterity. There will always be some return for the self in any gift — unless it can be articulated in an economy of ingratitude, a movement without return. Unless, that is, philosophy can become dissemination: ‘a work conceived radically is a movement of the same unto the other which never returns to the same ’. To the story of Ulysses, Levinas opposes that of Abraham who leaves his fatherland for ever, never to return. This figure of the diaspora returns us to one of the most important aspects of Levinas' formulation of the relation of the ethical to the political, that is the connections which he makes between the structure of ontology and Eurocentrism, the latter ‘disqualified’, as he puts it, ‘by so many horrors’. He connects the form of knowledge that is self-centred but directed outwards, philosophy as ‘egology’, quite explicitly with the appropriating narcissism of the West. So in the past few hundred years Europe has been, as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has suggested, constituted and consolidated as ‘sovereign subject, indeed sovereign and subject’. Just as the colonized has been constructed according to the terms of the colonizer's own self-image, as the ‘self-consolidating other’, so Europe consolidated itself as sovereign subject by defining its colonies as ‘Others’, even as it constituted them, for purposes of administration and the expansion of markets, into programmed near-images of that very sovereign self. It is this sovereign self of Europe which is today being deconstructed, showing the extent to which Europe's other has been a narcissistic self-image through which it has constituted itself while never allowing it to achieve a perfect fit. This can be allied to Derrida's critique of ‘a certain fundamental Europeanization of world culture’. Derrida has sometimes been criticized for the generality of phrases such as‘the history of the West’ or the claim that his work involves a critique of ‘Western metaphysics’. Although one of the earliest questions put to him in England concerned this category of ‘the West’, in the subsequent fervour that accompanied the transformation of Derrida's work into the method of deconstruction, this problem tended to slip out of view. In its largest and perhaps most significant perspective, deconstruction involves not just a critique of the grounds of knowledge in general, but specifically of the grounds of Occidental knowledge. The equation of knowledge with ‘what is called Western thought, the thought whose destiny is to extend its domains while the boundaries of the West are drawn back’ involves the very kind of assumption that Derrida is interrogating — and this is the reason for his  constant emphasis on its being the knowledge of the West; in the same way Foucault also emphasizes that he is specifically discussing the ‘Western episteme ’. The assertion that Derrida's work incurs a form of relativism is thus exactly to the point, though its implications are rather different from those generally assumed in such a complaint. For we can say that deconstruction involves the decentralization and decolonization of European thought — insofar as it is ‘incapable of respecting the Being and meaning of the other’, and to the extent that its philosophical tradition makes ‘common cause with oppression and with the totalitarianism of the same’. This has been the significance of Levinas' thought for Derrida. As he puts it in Writing and Difference , at the very moment when the fundamental conceptual systems of Europe are in the process of taking over all of humanity, Levinas leads us instead to ‘an inconceivable process of dismantling and dispossession’. For Levinas' thought seeks to liberate itself from the Greek domination of the Same and the One…as if from oppression itself — an oppression certainly comparable to none other in the world, an ontological or transcendental oppression, but also the origin or alibi of all oppression in the world. This is the context in which to set Derrida's own intervention in Of Grammatology . Everyone knows that that book is a critique of ‘logocentrism’; what is less often recalled is that the terms of the critique with which it opens announce the design of focusing attention on logocentrism's ethnocentrism ’ which, Derrida suggests, is ‘nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism, in the process of imposing itself upon the world’. It is this preoccupation which accounts for Derrida's choice, and forceful interrogation, of the privileged examples of Saussure — where he focuses on the ‘profound ethnocentrism’ of his exclusion of writing — Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss. In the case of the latter, Derrida's interest also focuses particularly on the way in which Lévi-Strauss produces his knowledge of a non-European civilization according to a doubled but non-contradictory logic which evades identity-thinking. The well-known deconstruction carried out in ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’ shows how the constitution of anthropological knowledge, though often paraded as scientific and objective, is nevertheless governed by a problematic of which it remains unaware: the philosophical category of the centre — which Derrida then proceeds to articulate with the problem of Eurocentrism. The analysis of the dialectics of the centre and the margin can thus operate geographically as well as conceptually, articulating the power relationships between the metropolitan and the colonial cultures at their geographical peripheries. This is not to suggest, however, that deconstruction in any sense brings another knowledge to bear: rather it involves a critique of Western knowledge that works by exploiting the ambivalent resources of Western writing, as if Marxism were to produce a critique of ideology without the advantage of its  science (which, given the current ambiguous status of Marxist science is not a possibility to be dismissed lightly). If one had to answer, therefore, the general question of what is deconstruction a deconstruction of, the answer would be, of the concept, the authority, and assumed primacy of, the category of ‘the West’. If deconstruction forms part of a more widespread attempt to decolonize the forms of European thought, from this perspective Derrida's work can be understood as characteristically postmodern. postmodernism can best be defined as European culture's awareness that it is no longer the unquestioned and dominant centre of the world. Significantly enough one of the very earliest uses of the term ‘postmodern’, dating from the time of the Second World War, was that of Arnold Toynbee in his A Study of History . He used it to describe the new age of Western history which, according to Toynbee, began in the 1870s with the simultaneous globalization of Western culture and the re-empowerment of non-Western states. If this new period brought with it a phase of Spenglerian pessimism after the long years of Victorian optimism, Toynbee did not himself assume that the West was in decline as such, but rather that paradoxically the globalization of Western civilization was being accompanied by a self-consciousness of its own cultural relativization, a process to which Toynbee's own equally totalizing and relativizing history was designed to contribute. Reviewing the genesis of his whole project, he recounts that his history was written against a current Late Modern Western convention of identifying a parvenu and provincial Western Society's history with ‘History’, writ large,sans phrase . In the writer's view this convention was the preposterous off-spring of a distorting egocentric illusion to which the children of a Western Civilisation had succumbed like the children of all other known civilisations and known primitive societies. Postmodernism, therefore, becomes a certain self-consciousness about a culture's own historical relativity — which begins to explain why, as its critics complain, it also involves the loss of the sense of an absoluteness of any Western account of History. Today, if we pose the difficult question of the relation of poststructuralism to postmodernism, one distinction between them that might be drawn would be that whereas postmodernism seems to include the problematic of the place of Western culture in relation to non-Western cultures, poststructuralism as a category seems not to imply such a perspective. This, however, is hardly the case, for it rather involves if anything a more active critique of the Eurocentric premises of Western knowledge. The difference would be that it does not offer a critique by positioning itself outside ‘the West’, but rather uses its own alterity and duplicity in order to effect its deconstruction. In this context, we may note, attempts to account for poststructuralism in terms of the aftermath of the events of May 68 seem positively myopic, lacking the very historical  perspective to which they lay claim. Contrary, then, to some of its more overreaching definitions, postmodernism itself could be said to mark not just the cultural effects of a new stage of ‘late’ capitalism, but the sense of the loss of European history and culture as History and Culture, the loss of their unquestioned place at the centre of the world. We could say that if, according to Foucault, the centrality of ‘Man’ dissolved at the end of the eighteenth century as the ‘Classical Order’gave way to ‘History’, today at the end of the twentieth century, as ‘History’gives way to the ‘Postmodern’, we are witnessing the dissolution of ‘the West’."
ACA ACA-FEF-001 -0.26 "1. Maxwell's equations One of the chief peculiarities of this treatise is the doctrine which asserts, that the true electric current on which the electromagnetic phenomena depend, is not the same thing as the current of conduction, but that the time variation of the electric displacement must be taken into account in estimating the total movement of electricity. JAMES CLARK MAXWELL A treatise on electricity and magnetism Oxford 1873 ALL the problems we shall be concerned with may be solved by calling upon one or more of the following equations: . Where do the above equations come from? They are contained (though not quite in the same form and not in the same system of units) in Chapter IX of Maxwell's Treatise on electricity and magnetism published in 1873. Are we to conclude that electromagnetic theory has made no advance in the course of a century? That conclusion would essentially be correct. Our technique of solving the above equations has improved, and of course we are in a much better position now to evaluate the material constants, but fundamentally electromagnetic theory stands now as it stood a century ago. As far as the interrelationship of electromagnetic quantities is concerned Maxwell knew as much as we do today. He did not actually suggest communication between continents with the aid of geostationary satellites, but if he was taken now to a satellite ground-station he would not be numbed with astonishment. If we would give him half an hour to get over the shock of his resurrection he would quietly sit down with a piece of paper (the back of a bigger envelope, I suppose) and would work out the relevant design formulae. The lack of advance on our part should not be attributed to the idleness of a century, much rather to the genius of Maxwell. The moment he conceived the idea of the displacement current, a new era started in the history of mankind. Events of similar importance did not occur often. Newton's Principia and Einstein's first paper on relativity would qualify, and perhaps two or three more learned papers, but that's about all. If we assume that our kind of beings will still be around a few millennia hence, I feel certain that the nineteenth century will mainly be remembered as the century when Maxwell formulated his equations. What was so extraordinary about Maxwell's contribution? It was the first (and may be the best) example of reaching a synthesis on the basis of experimental evidence, mathematical intuition, and prophetic insight. The term  (1.1) had no experimental basis at the time. By adding this new term to the known equations he managed to describe all macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena. And when relativity came, Newton's equations were found wanting but not Maxwell's; they needed no relativistic correction. I could go on for a long time in praise of Maxwell. Unfortunately we have little time for digressions however entertaining they might be. But before we get down to the equations I must say a few words in defence of the approach I choose. I know it must be hard for anyone to accept a set of equations without going through the usual routine of presenting the relevant experimental justifications. It might seem a little unreasonable at first sight but believe me this is a possible approach, and under the circumstances it may very well be the best approach. You are already familiar with the mathematical operations curl, div, and grad (I prefer using them in vector-operator form), and you need no introduction to the concepts of electricity. You have heard about electric charge, current, magnetic field, etc. All the eqns (1.1) -(1.7) do is go give a number of relationships between these quantities. So if some of them are known, you can use the equations to work out some of the others. The notation is fairly standard but still I should better say what is what: H, magnetic field strength; E, electric field strength; D, electric flux density; B, magnetic flux density; J, current density; p, charge density; F, force, q, charge; v, velocity of moving charge; u, permeability; e, permittivity. The  two latter quantities are constants depending on the material under study. Using the subscript zero to denote their values in free space, they come to . The rest of the course will be concerned with the various solutions of eqns (1.1) -(1.7). Isn't this boring for an engineer? Shouldn't this be done by mathematicians or by computer programmers? Not for the time being. Perhaps one day computers will be big enough and numerical analysts clever enough so that the engineer will only have to pose the problem, but not yet, and not, I think, for some time to come. In the large majority of cases a straightforward mathematical solution is just out of the question. So one has to use that delicate substance known as physical intuition. How can one acquire physical intuition? There is no easy way. One has to start with a simple physical configuration, solve the corresponding mathematical problem, then solve a similar problem and then another problem, and then a little more difficult problem, and soon. The first breakthrough comes when one can predict a solution without actually doing the mathematics. In order to have a unified view of the subject we have started with Maxwell's equations. It means a new approach but not a radical departure. The subject is still the same. You will be able to see that the laws you love and cherish (Coulomb's, Biot-Savart's, Snell's, etc.) all follow from our eqns (1.1) -(1.7). The order of discussion will follow the traditional one: electrostatics first, followed by steady currents, then we shall move on to slowly varying phenomena, and reach finally the most interesting part, fast-varying phenomena, exhibiting the full beauty of Maxwell's wonderful equations."
ACA ACA-FT1-001 -0.21 "Editorials ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction May benefit patients with left ventricular dysfunction Studies in animals and humans have shown that giving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction reduces left ventricular remodelling, and this effect has been linked to benefits in clinical outcome. The recently published results of three large randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials focus on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and morbidity caused by ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction. Ventricular remodelling comprises infarct expansion and global ventricular dilatation. Infarct expansion, or thinning and lengthening of the infarcted myocardium, is seen within hours after myocardial necrosis and is usually complete within three weeks after infarction. Global ventricular dilatation, which results from a progressive increase in myocyte length with sarcomere recruitment and resulting hypertrophy of the non-infarcted myocardium, continues for a long time. Infarct expansion may result in cardiac rupture, aneurysm, and thrombus formation. Global ventricular dilatation results in progressive increase in the volume of the ventricular cavity, which is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and a recognised precursor of symptomatic heart failure. In the SAVE (survival and ventricular enlargement) and the SOLVD (studies of left ventricular dysfunction) prevention trials an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was given to patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction with the aim of reducing mortality and the incidence of heart failure. The SAVE trial enrolled 2231 patients who had suffered myocardial infarction, had ejection fractions equal to or less than 40%, and had no symptoms of heart failure. The mean time after myocardial infarction to treatment was 11 days. The SOLVD prevention study included 4220 patients, nearly 80% of whom had history of myocardial infarction, with ejection fractions equal to or less than 35%. Entry into this trial (as opposed to the SOLVD treatment trial) required that the patient had no symptoms and was taking no treatment for heart failure. These patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril (SAVE) or enalapril (SOLVD prevention). The mean follow up was 42 and 37.4 months respectively. In the CONSENSUS II (cooperative north Scandinavian enalapril survival study II) an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was given within 24 hours of myocardial infarction in addition to standard treatment and irrespective of baseline ventricular function (though patients with clinical evidence of heart failure at the time of entry into the study were excluded). This trial had the potential for identifying a distinct effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the early, infarct expansion, phase of remodelling. It enrolled 6090 patients and assigned them to enalapril or placebo. The mean time to treatment was 15 hours. Interim analysis showed no reduction in mortality and an increased incidence of hypotension in the enalapril group, so the trial was discontinued. The follow up varied from 41 to 180 days, and because the trial was stopped only 48% of the patients were followed up for six months. In the SAVE study all cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly reduced in the captopril group, by 19% and 21% respectively. A reduction in the incidence of progressive heart failure was primarily responsible for the reduced mortality. In the SOLVD prevention trial trends toward reduction in all cause and cardiovascular mortality in the enalapril group did not reach statistical significance. In CONSENSUS II there was no significant reduction in all cause and cardiovascular mortality with treatment. The lack of survival benefit was consistent in all predefined subgroups (anterior myocardial infarction, age over 70 years, and concomitant baseline treatment). In the SAVE and SOLVD prevention trials development of symptomatic heart failure, progression of heart failure, rate of admission with heart failure, and incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction were all reduced in the treatment group. In the CONSENSUS II study there was no significant reduction in any of these end points, although the rate of change of treatment due to worsening heart failure was significantly reduced in the treatment group. Why did the SOLVD prevention and CONSENSUS II trials show no apparent benefit on mortality? In the SOLVD prevention study nearly 19% of the placebo group received open label treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during follow up and this crossover may have resulted in underestimation of survival benefit. In addition, patients entering this study were more likely to have had no symptoms of heart failure than those in the SAVE study, in which treatment for heart failure was permitted. The apparent lack of benefit of early angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in the CONSENSUS II trial may have been related to the design or to theoretical issues. Patients with non-Q wave, inferior, and previous myocardial infarction have a reduced risk of infarct expansion. Thrombolytic agents might reduce the stimulus to remodelling by  limiting infarct size and augmenting blood flow to additional jeopardised zones. Moreover, since the use of thrombolytic agents and aspirin in patients with myocardial infarction improves short and long term survival we would expect to have to give any additional treatment for a longer period to a larger number of patients to show a further reduction in mortality. On the other hand, an adverse influence of giving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors early after myocardial infarction might result from systemic or direct myocardial effects of these agents. Systemic hypotension may reduce coronary perfusion; in the CONSENSUS II trial there was an increased incidence of first dose hypotension in the enalapril group (10.5% v 2.5% in placebo group) and mortality was increased in patients who showed this effect. Myocardial angiotensin II increases the rate of myocardial protein synthesis, promotes growth of myocytes, and promotes collagen expression by fibroblasts, and large increases in angiotensin converting enzyme activity are found in the scar tissue after myocardial necrosis. In the short term these effects may serve to maintain cardiac structural integrity and normalise cardiac performance, in part by augmenting chamber compliance. Thus angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may actually worsen clinical outcome by inhibiting an early protective effect of angiotensin II on cardiac structure. Do the data from the CONSENSUS II study provide conclusive proof that giving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor early produces no survival benefit? The findings certainly highlight the risk of hypotension; elderly people and patients with inferior myocardial infarction have a greater propensity for this complication. On the other hand, an echocardiographic substudy showed that the increase in ventricular volume was significantly reduced in the six months after myocardial infarction, presumably because of attenuation of remodelling — as supported by the data from the SOLVD prevention and the SAVE studies. The factors that could potentially have been influenced by early angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment are infarct size and expansion, and we have no specific data on these. Indeed, the effect of early treatment on infarct size and expansion may be seen only in subgroups of patients, and future studies should be directed at identifying such groups. Though many issues remain to be resolved, data from the SOLVD prevention and SAVE trials provide compelling evidence that patients recovering from myocardial infarction with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction equal to or less than 40%) benefit from long term administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. While routine, early administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors cannot presently be recommended in patients with acute myocardial infarction, this strategy needs further evaluation in high risk subgroups, especially patients with large, first anteroapical infarction. The thrifty genotype in non-insulin dependent diabetes The hypothesis survives In 1962 Neel proposed that the persistence of diabetes mellitus must mean that the diabetic genotype holds some survival advantage. Two decades later, after the clearer recognition of the distinction between insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, Neel modified his hypothesis so that it related specifically to non-insulin dependent diabetes. Despite some scepticism, the ‘thrifty genotype’ remains a convenient explanation for the extremely high incidence of non-insulin dependent diabetes that develops in many populations which have experienced rapid socioeconomic modernisation during this century. The thrifty genotype is thought to have offered a survival advantage to individuals in hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies, who were subject to periods of nutritional hardship, by favouring fat deposition during periods when food was abundant. In modern times, when physical activity has decreased and calories are in constant supply (usually in an energy dense form high in fat and simple carbohydrates), the genotype has become disadvantageous and favours the development of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Central to the need for the thrifty genotype hypothesis is the assumption that, when expressed, non-insulin dependent diabetes was associated with diminished fertility (at least before the advent of modern medicine). Certainly, a reproductive handicap has recently been shown in young Nauruan women with early onset non-insulin dependent diabetes. Whether or not humans with a thrifty genotype did in the past (or continue to) better survive periods of famine has not been directly proved. This assumption rests largely on the observation of high susceptibility to non-insulin dependent diabetes in populations known historically to have experienced such episodes. North American Indians, Polynesian and Micronesian Pacific islanders, Australian Aborigines, and Asian Indians are usually considered in these terms, but it is not known whether all human populations previously subject to severe ‘feast and famine’ conditions have a thrifty genotype. Recently some migrant African and Chinese populations have also been found to be susceptible to non-insulin dependent diabetes, and people of European origin might be the only true ‘low susceptibility’ group. As Weatherall suggested in his 1992 Harveian oration, this implies either that the positive selective forces favouring the thrifty genotype were not as strong in Europeans or that the negative selective forces of a sedentary, well nourished lifestyle have operated for sufficiently long to diminish the frequency of the genotype. Whatever the case, non-insulin dependent diabetes in Europeans tends to occur in middle or older age, after completion of the reproductive phase in women, and contrasts with the early age of onset and severity of the disease observed in populations such as Nauruans. Experimental support for the thrifty genotype comes from work in rodents showing that strains susceptible to obesity and diabetes have lower metabolic rates, defective thermoregulatory mechanisms, and an enhanced ability to store food as fat and to survive prolonged fasting. Prospective studies in Pima Indians indicate that ‘thrifty’ lower metabolic rates in humans may favour weight gain. The metabolic expression of the thrifty genotype favouring non-insulin dependent diabetes would appear to be via selective tissue insulin resistance and relatively high basal and stimulated insulin concentrations. Under modern conditions these promote obesity and a vicious cycle of increasing insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, leading ultimately to pancreatic β cell decompensation and frank diabetes. Adapting data from known insulin resistant states such as obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes, O'Dea has recently theorised on the nature of metabolic adaptations which might have favoured survival in Australian Aborigines in the context of their traditional hunter-gatherer diet, where ‘feasts’ on wild animals such as kangaroos were characteristically high in protein and relatively low in fat and carbohydrate. In this case, selective insulin resistance in liver would promote conversion of dietary protein to glucose and fat via active hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is not sensitive to insulin suppression, and lipogenesis, which is insulin sensitive. Meanwhile, fat accumulation would be encouraged by insulin sensitive adipose tissue and the relative resistance to glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This concept of selective insulin resistance is not new and has been well demonstrated in animal models. In a recent publication Wendorf and Goldfine have related apparent variation in susceptibility to non-insulin dependent diabetes among North American Indian tribes to the timing of migrations into the continent. They have hypothesised that a ‘thrifty genotype’ may have been selected around 10000–11000 years ago in a subgroup of ancestral Indians with a particular reliance on vanishing big game species such as mammoths. While difficult to prove, the development of such hypotheses at least indicates that researchers are attempting to justify reliance on the thrifty genotype to explain variation in non-insulin dependent diabetes frequency. In Pima Indians a considerable body of work favours a selective insulin resistance in muscle as the metabolic expression of the thrifty genotype. This includes the demonstration that insulin action appears to aggregate in families and that its distribution is compatible with a single gene codominant mode of inheritance. None the less, except for specific mutations to key enzymes in rare syndromes of familial diabetes and the recently identified link between some kindreds of maturity onset diabetes of the young and mutations to the glucokinase gene in liver and β cells, the gene(s) causing the bulk of cases of non-insulin dependent diabetes remain obscure. While a single defect may be responsible in small unique populations such as Pima Indians and Nauruans, in larger high prevalence populations a polygenic causation is most likely. It would be too much to expect convergent evolution to have produced a single thrifty genotype in all populations by chance, and the most likely situation is that several genes have been selected in different combinations, in different populations, to produce a phenotypically similar syndrome. The search for the genes responsible for non-insulin dependent diabetes continues and may one day offer the option of high risk or even general population screening, and perhaps specific gene manipulation therapies. However, even now the epidemiological evidence for the disadvantages of a sedentary lifestyle and Western diet in causing current epidemics of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes in the developing world provides a compelling basis for promoting primary prevention of these diseases. Certainly, preventive strategies and modern medicine will tend to counteract negative selective forces and will maintain the frequency of the thrifty genotype in human populations, but, as Neel soberly pointed out, ‘efforts to preserve the diabetes genotype through this transient period of plenty are in the interests of mankind,’ for some time in the future we may again be glad to have it. Deprivation payments Still awaiting change Deprivation payments were introduced with the 1990 general practitioner contract with the intention of putting more resources into practices where deprivation might be expected to increase the demand for services. Laudable though the aim might be, the results have been much criticised. Arguments over using the ‘Jarman index’ to assess demand for services and the method of payment have obscured the principle underlying the payments. This was that a proportion of the pool funding for General Medical Services would be redirected to practices in high demand, deprived areas. Using scores derived from the Jarman underprivileged area index for this purpose seems to have face validity — the index was developed from a survey of one in 10 British general practitioners who were asked to weight social factors according to how much they thought they increased workload. Using census data, scores were derived for areas of the country either on the basis of ward or enumerator district (with average populations of 5327 and 450 respectively) and extra money is provided to practices with a higher proportion of factors perceived by a representative sample of doctors to equate to high patient demand. Critics have argued that no evidence exists that Jarman's weighted factors actually create extra workload; indeed, some state that doctors in high scoring areas may actually work fewer hours. Such arguments are themselves spurious since general practitioners are able to ration their workload despite potential demand by controlling access through measures such as rapid consultations, short surgery hours, or other barriers to visits. They can thereby create patient expectation of the level of demand that will be serviced. The actual workload of doctors does not necessarily reflect accurately the potential demand for their services, as unmet need is not taken into account. Calculating any extra resource using an index based on doctors' own perceptions of what creates work seems the more valid approach as these will presumably be factors deterring doctors from working in underprivileged areas or causing them to limit access so as to avoid overwork. Despite almost a decade of critical review and the existence of alternative formulas for identifying deprivation the Jarman index remains as good an indicator of potential demand for general practitioner services as exists. Major problems, however, arise over its application. Census data are used to calculate the scores, but these may be as much as 12 years out of date(current data were collected in 1981; scores based on the 1991 census are expected later this year). Averaging scores to a ward can exclude payments to practices in deprived parts of otherwise affluent wards and put unnecessary resources into practices in pleasant parts of underprivileged wards. Graduating payments and particularly the high score needed to trigger any payment are problems. Most important is this extra income might not result in any attempt to improve care. The Department of Health has talked about refining elements of the general practitioner contract. Basing the deprivation payments on the Jarman index still seems the best option, although it is time the Department of Health supported research into its validation. Such studies should focus on the workload in comparable practices — for example, practices in high and low deprivation areas with similar levels of commitment. Considerable fine tuning of the eligibility criteria is needed. Payments could be limited to a maximum number of patients per general practitioner which would stop the protests that a single handed general practitioner with a list of 3000 in an area of high deprivation receives an extra £28 800 a year without any obligation to provide extra services. That maximum should be as low as 1300 to 1500 patients per full time principal. Perhaps the most important function of deprivation payments was to compensate practices with low lists after the introduction of the new contract, which linked income much more closely to capitation. The payments should not encourage high lists in areas of deprivation. Eligibility according to ward is a further problem that using enumeration districts would partially overcome, although a much greater margin of error (approaching 50%) comes from converting patient postcodes to enumeration districts than to wards. Perhaps some of the total expenditure on deprivation payments could be reserved by the family health services authorities for appeals, providing that the money was ‘ring fenced.’ Authorities could, within clear guidelines, make discretionary payments — for example, to practices on the boundaries of ‘deprived’ wards who could show that they would receive payment if enumeration districts were used. Similarly, practices could appeal if they had evidence that the population characteristics had altered substantially since the last census. Furthermore, it could be possible to update locally certain factors in the Jarman index more regularly, especially unemployment rates, which change so rapidly. Lowering of the entry point for payment from the 30 point on the Jarman scale — Jarman has suggested that 16 is more appropriate — and the use of more payment bands might be considered. This would increase the proportion of patients attracting some deprivation payment to their practice from the current 9% to about 20% of the population. Current total spending on deprivation payments could be maintained despite increasing the eligibility for payments if the average per capita fee was lowered. Spreading the benefits too thinly, however, might undermine the viability of the most needy practices. An important priority is to ensure that extra income is spent on extra activity. Limiting maximum eligible patients per doctor would help, as would requiring some broad declaration by the practice as to how the sum would be spent (such as will occur with the revised health promotion payments). Practices receiving substantial payments should be expected to employ sufficient ancillary staff — for example, nearer two full time equivalent staff per doctor rather than the one to one ratio so often seen. Pressure could also be exerted on practices to adopt 10 minute consultation bookings, given the relation between length of consultation and quality of performance. It is, however, difficult to see how ambitious practice aims could be realised from payments made and therefore subject to change on a quarterly basis. We need to canvas opinion and collect data from innovative practices in deprived areas to find out how payments have been best used to support their greater patient demand. Clearly without the deprivation payments some good inner city practices would have been bankrupted by the new contract. Unfortunately, because of anomalies in the system, the needs of other deserving practices are still not being met. Improving London's health service Now comes the hard part After a century's diagnosis of the ills of London's health service many in Britain will welcome almost any prescription that stops 15% of the population consuming 20% of NHS resources. But for those living and working in London the decisions made last week by the government (see p 537) have to face a harder test. Will they improve or worsen the standard of care given to Londoners — and to a wider group of patients who use London's specialist services and benefit from its research and teaching? Many people have been disappointed that last week's decisions were not more precise — defining, for example, exactly what should happen to St Bartholomew's or Charing Cross Hospital. But London's pattern of hospitals is such a historical muddle that no one can wave a wand and transform everything overnight. Restructuring will inevitably entail compromises, and it is important that those who have to make the compromises work should be involved in fashioning them. In general Mrs Bottomley has set clear boundaries and timetables for the decisions and told the relevant authorities to work out their own salvation within them. In return she should ensure that her mechanisms for protecting research and education are robust enough to enable London's hospitals to operate fairly within the internal market. The boundaries make sense, but there is an air of indecent haste about the timetables. Even though many of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's recommendations, now endorsed by the government, worked with the grain of changes already occurring, some of the timetables are short. The specialty reviews, for example, have to assess current and projected needs, define criteria for tertiary services, and advise on the most cost effective and clinically effective locations — all by the end of May. This work will not be done in a vacuum, but for a problem that has existed for at least a lifetime a few more months of thought might lead to better outcomes, and ones that will be more readily accepted. Likewise, the agent of change might have been better devised to give more confidence in the outcome. At present the London Implementation Group smells too much of hole in the corner deals: the working part of the group consists only of two named people, one of them a former Thames regional chairman, and the ordinary members of the specialty review committees (see p 589) and of the all important Primary Health Care Forum had not yet been announced as we went to press. The group might knock heads together but it doesn't seem designed to do the equally important job of explaining what is happening to staff and patients. And Londoners need explanations and reassurance. Over the past few months they have been told that their primary and community health care is awful; now the government tells them that accident and emergency departments will shut, along with 2000-odd hospital beds, when their immediate evidence is that it is hard to get into hospital. Likewise, the implementation group's human resources subgroup sounds too low key to convince staff that the NHS will tackle the problems of maintaining morale and preserving skills while changes go on. Part of the problem for Londoners is that the notion of transformed primary and community care, breaking down the boundaries between hospital and community, is still unclear. The government has accepted Tomlinson's recommendation for investment in premises and has set up an initiative zone to encourage new ideas. There are plenty of good ideas around, but the worry is that the sheer difficulty of practising in inner cities will overwhelm even the most enthusiastic practitioners and managers and that they will ‘settle for more of the same…but out of better buildings.’ Much will depend on the leadership and vision of the Primary Health Care Forum. Perhaps the biggest gap in both the Tomlinson report and Making London Better concerns research and postgraduate teaching. The government has already decided to bring special health authorities into the internal market. It also wants a market in research, and it promises a mechanism for funding the excess costs of academic teaching and clinical research. But there is little inkling of how the mechanism will work, and we have to wait until December for the management executive and the Department of Education to come up with ideas. They are badly needed: as Green has said, ‘It would be easy for clinical research to become the first and indeed the greatest casualty of reductions in size in London.’ This is particularly true since London has a pressing need for a shift in acute beds towards those serving elderly Londoners with multiple diseases and away from younger patients with interesting single diseases (J James, MSD Foundation symposium, 1992). London may just be carrying too big a burden of research and teaching for its population — but the means by which research and education get redistributed, rather than simply shut, remain unclear. It is easy to criticise the government's decisions: after a century of inertia, making changes in London was always going to be difficult, and Mrs Bottomley deserves credit for getting the process started. But she needs to remember that deciding strategies is easy; implementing them is hard. She has given a lot of commitment to the strategy; she now needs to give as much to the process of change and to ensuring that the public understands it. Londoners have for long been perversely proud of a health  service that does not serve them well. They now have a chance of a better one — but they need to be able to recognise that. Treating bed wetting Bladder exercises, star charts, enuresis alarms, and now ERIC Bed wetting is not the most glamorous of paediatric problems; treating it, however, can be highly rewarding because treatment is so often successful. There are an estimated 500000 sufferers aged between 6 and 16 in Britain. From reports of management within enuresis clinics it is reasonable to predict that 400000 might be curable. Nocturnal enuresis alone, particularly if primary, is both a disorder of maturation and a genetic trait. Compared with controls, patients are three to four times more likely to have a parent who had been enuretic. They are also more likely to have excessive diffuse slow background activity on electroencephalography and are significantly shorter than controls. Minor neurological dysfunction is common, including mild hypotonia, problems with coordination or fine manipulation, and mild dyskinesia. Many such ‘clumsy children’ have learning problems, emotional difficulties, and problems with relationships. These may be provoked by the lowered self esteem that many suffer as a result of teasing and criticism by peers, parents, and teachers. Within this group the wetters do even worse. Add to these handicaps serious life changes or stress, such as parental separation, and the setting is complete for the misery, embarrassment, and shame of bed wetting. Daytime and mixed day and night wetters have certain aetiological differences from night wetters, although there is much overlap: they are more likely to have had an adverse perinatal history, their bladder capacity tends to be smaller, and they are more likely to suffer urinary tract infection. It has been suggested that their urological dysfunction may be a marker of perinatal neurological damage, but in a study of 191 wetters those with dyssynergic bladders and increased residual urine were also those with the most severe behavioural problems. The most effective treatment is dry bed training and an enuresis alarm. Devlin and O'Cathain found that of 122 children consecutively referred, 22 became dry after a structured interview (with the child alone as well as with a parent), advice on personal hygiene and cleanliness training, daily bladder exercises, and provision of a ‘star chart.’ These authors supplied a further 96 children with an enuresis alarm; 81 achieved initial success (42 consecutive dry nights) at a mean of 7.3 weeks (range 1–26 weeks). Eleven required a second try, of whom nine achieved dryness. Success is more likely when the problem is maturational and less likely when there is psychiatric disorder of the child, severe family stress, absence of concern by child and parents, urological dysfunction, and developmental delay. Other poor prognostic signs may be coexisting day wetting and maternal intolerance of the enuretic child. Drugs have a minor role: tricyclic antidepressants have little effect and are not suitable to be kept in households where there is a combination of young children and stress. Oxybutynin is unhelpful except, perhaps, in children whose enuresis is part of a syndrome including frequency, urgency, dysuria, and covert bacteriuria. Desmopressin, 20–40 mg nightly intranasally is effective during treatment in 12% to 70% of cases; only up to 31% remain dry after the course of treatment. There is no long term advantage of three months' over one month's treatment. It may be of most value for occasional use, in known responders, to save embarrassment when sleeping away from home. It must not be prescribed without a careful history; if the child's real problem is not enuresis but psychogenic polydipsia, desmopressin may provoke water intoxication and hyponatraemic fits (RAF Bell et al , personal communication). Patient and parent support groups are often valuable in paediatric practice. The Enuresis Resource and Information Centre (ERIC) is a registered charity providing advice and information to children, parents, and professionals. It runs a confidential telephone counselling service and publishes material for teenagers, parents, and others. Taking a leaf from the book of other lobby groups, it is in the process of publishing guidelines on minimum standards of clinical practice and offering a consultative service to purchasers on their implementation."
ACA ACA-HRG-004 -0.11 "CHAPTER 11 The Crystalline State 11.1 Introduction When polymers are irradiated by a beam of X-rays, scattering produces diffuse haloes on the photographic plate for some polymers, while for others a series of sharply defined rings superimposed on a diffuse background is recorded. The former are characteristic of amorphous polymers, and illustrate that a limited amount of short range order exists in most polymeric solids. The latter patterns are indicative of considerable three-dimensional order and are typical of polycrystalline samples containing a large number of unoriented crystallites associated with amorphous regions. The rings are observed to sharpen into arcs, or discrete spots, if the polymer is drawn or stretched, a process which orients the axes of the crystallites in one direction. The occurrence of significant crystallinity in a polymer sample is of considerable consequence to a materials scientist. The properties of the sample — the density, optical clarity, modulus, and general mechanical response all change dramatically when crystallites are present and the polymer is no longer subject to the rules of linear visco-elasticity, which apply to amorphous polymers as outlined in Chapter 13. However, a polymer sample is rarely completely crystalline and the properties also depend on the amount of crystalline order. It is important then to examine crystallinity in polymers and determine the factors which control the extent of crystallinity. 11.2 Mechanism of crystallization A polymer in very dilute solution can be effectively regarded as an isolated chain whose shape is governed by short and long range inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In the aggregated state this is no longer true, the behaviour of the chain is now influenced largely by the proximity of the neighbouring chains and the secondary valence forces which act between them. These factors determine the orientation of chains relative to each other in the undiluted state, and this is essentially an interplay between the entropy and internal energy of the system which is expressed in the usual thermodynamic form  In the melt, polymers normally attain a state of maximum entropy consistent with a stable state of minimum free energy. Crystallization is a process involving the orderly  arrangement of chains and is consequently associated with a large negative entropy of activation. If a favourable free energy change is to be obtained for crystallite formation, the entropy term has to be offset by a large negative energy contribution. The alignment of polymer chains at specific distances from one another to form crystalline nuclei will be assisted when intermolecular forces are strong. The greater this interaction between chains the more favourable will be the energy parameter and this provides some indication of the type of chain which might be expected to crystallize from the melt, viz. (1) Symmetrical chains which allow the regular close packing required for crystallite formation. (2) Chains possessing groups which encourage strong intermolecular attraction thereby stabilizing the alignment. In addition to the thermodynamic requirements, kinetic factors relating to the flexibility and mobility of a chain in the melt must also be considered. Thus polyisobutylene  might be expected to crystallize because the chain is symmetrical, but it will only do so if maintained at an optimum temperature for several months. This is presumably a result of the flexibility of the chain which allows extensive convolution thereby impeding stabilization of the required long range alignment. The creation of a three-dimensional ordered phase from a disordered state is a two stage process. Just above its melting temperature a polymer behaves like a highly viscous liquid in which the chains are all tangled up with their neighbours. Each chain pervades a given volume in the sample, but as the temperature decreases the volume available to the molecule also decreases. This in turn restricts the number of disordered conformational states available to the chain due to the constraining influence of intramolecular interactions among chains in juxtaposition. As a result there is an increasing tendency for the polymer to assume an ordered conformation in which the chain bonds are in the rotational states of lowest energy. However, various other factors will tend to oppose crystallization; chain entanglements will hinder the diffusion of chains into suitable orientations and if the temperature is above the melting temperature, thermal motions will be sufficient to disrupt the potential nuclei before significant growth can take place. This restricts crystallization to a range of temperatures between T g and T m . The first step in crystallite formation is the creation of a stable nucleus brought about by the ordering of chains in a parallel array, stimulated by intramolecular forces, followed by the stabilization of long range order by the secondary valence forces which aid the packing of molecules into a three-dimensional ordered structure. The second stage is the growth of the crystalline region, the size of which is governed by the rate of addition of other chains to the nucleus. As this growth is counteracted by thermal redispersion of the chains at the crystal-melt interface, the temperature must be low enough to ensure that this disordering process is minimal. 11.3 Temperature and growth rate Measurable rates of crystallization occur between  and , a range in which the thermal motion of the polymer chains is conducive to the formation of stable ordered regions. The growth rate of crystalline areas passes through a   maximum in this range as illustrated in figure 11.1 for isotactic polystyrene. Close to T m the segmental motion is too great to allow many stable nuclei to form, while near T g the melt is so viscous that molecular motion is extremely slow. As the temperature drops from T m , the melt viscosity, which is a function of the molar mass, increases and the diffusion rate decreases, thereby giving the chains greater opportunity to rearrange themselves to form a nucleus. This means that there will exist an optimum temperature of crystallization, which depends largely on the interval T m to T g , but also on the molar mass of the sample. The melt usually has to be supercooled by about 5 to 20 K before a significant number of nuclei appear which possess the critical dimensions required for stability and further growth. If a nucleating agent is added to the system, crystallization can be induced at higher temperatures. This is known as heterogeneous nucleation and only affects the crystallization rate, not the spherulitic growth rate, at a given temperature. 11.4 Melting The melting of a perfectly crystalline substance is an equilibrium process characterized by a marked volume change and a well-defined melting temperature. Polymers are never perfectly crystalline, but contain disordered regions and crystallites of varying size. The process is normally incomplete because crystallization takes place when the polymer is a viscous liquid. In this state, the chains are highly entangled, and as  sufficient time must be allowed for the chains to diffuse into the three-dimensional order required for crystallite formation, the crystalline perfection of the sample is affected by the thermal history. Thus, rapid cooling from the melt usually prevents the development of significant crystallinity. The result is that melting takes place over a range of temperatures, and this range is a useful indication of sample crystallinity. Effect of crystallite size on melting. The range of temperature, which covers the melting of a polymer, is indicative of the size and perfection of the crystallites in the sample. This is illustrated in a study of the melting of natural rubber samples, which has shown that the melting range is a function of the temperature of crystallization. At low crystallization temperatures the nucleation density in the rubber melt is high, segmental diffusion rates are low, and small imperfect crystalline regions are formed. Thus broad melting ranges are measured for samples crystallized at these lower temperatures, and these become narrower as the crystallization temperature increases. This suggests that careful annealing at the appropriate temperature could produce samples with a high degree of crystallinity. These samples might then exhibit almost perfect first order phase changes at the melting temperature. A close approximation to these conditions has been attained by Mandelkern, who annealed a linear polyethylene for 40 days. The improvement in the crystalline organization is obvious from examination of the resulting fusion curves in figure 11.2, where the variation of specific volume with temperature for this sample is compared with that for a branched    polyethylene of low crystallinity. The effect of branching is to decrease the percentage crystallinity, broaden the melting range, and reduce the average melting temperature. The points A and B in the diagram represent the temperatures at which the largest crystallites disappear and are regarded as the respective melting temperatures T m for the samples. The effect of crystal size on T m is shown more clearly in figure 11.3. The small crystals melt about 30 K lower than the large ones due to the greater contribution from the interfacial free energy in the smaller crystallites, i.e. there is an excess of free energy associated with the disordered chains emerging from the ends of ordered crystallites and this is relatively greater for the small crystallites, resulting in lower melting temperatures. 11.5 Thermodynamic parameters Even with carefully annealed specimens, it is thought that the equilibrium melting temperature of the completely crystalline polymer T m is never actually attained. The temperature T m is related to the change in enthalpy ΔH u and the entropy change ΔS u , for the first order melting transition of pure crystalline polymer to pure amorphous melt, by  The enthalpy change can be estimated by adding varying quantities of a diluent to the    polymer, which serves to depress the observed melting temperature, and measuring T m for each polymer + diluent mixture. The results are then plotted according to the Flory equation  where  is the ratio of the molar volume of the repeating unit in the chain to that of the diluent, and φ 1 , is the volume fraction of the diluent. The factor  is equivalent to the Flory interaction parameter χ 1 , indicating that equation (11.2) is dependent on the polymer-diluent interaction. For practical purposes T m is taken to be the melting temperature of the undiluted polymer irrespective of the crystalline content. Typical values obtained in this way are shown in table 11.1 In many cases the entropy change is the most important influence on the magnitude of the melting temperature of a polymer. A large part of this entropy is due to the additional freedom which allows the chain conformational changes to occur in the melt, after the restrictions of the crystalline lattice. In the crystalline phase the chain bonds are in their lowest energy state. If the energy difference between the rotational states Δε is low, the population of the higher energy states will increase in the melt and considerable flexing of the chain is achieved. The contribution of ΔS u is then high. When Δε is large, the tendency to populate the high energy states is not too great, consequently the chain is less flexible and ΔS u is lower. Two polymers which exist in the all trans state in the crystal are polyethylene and poly(tetrafluoroethylene). For polyethylene Δε is about 3.0 kJ mol -′, but it is as high as 18.0 kJ mol -′ for poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Hence the polyethylene chain is much more flexible in the melt and gains considerably more entropy on melting, so that T m is correspondingly lower. 11.6 Crystalline arrangement of polymers The formation of stable crystalline regions in a polymer requires that, (i) an economical close packed arrangement of the chains can be achieved in three dimensions, and that (ii) a favourable change in internal energy is obtained during this process . This imposes restrictions on the type of chain which can be crystallized with ease and, as mentioned earlier, one would expect symmetrical linear chains such as polyesters, polyamides, and polyethylene to crystallize most readily. FACTORS AFFECTING CRYSTALLINITY AND T m  These can be dealt with under the general headings, symmetry, intermolecular bonding, tacticity, branching and molar mass. Symmetry. The symmetry of the chain shape influences both T m and the ability to form crystallites. Polyethylene and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) are both sufficiently symmetrical to be considered as smooth stiff cylindrical rods. In the crystal these rods tend to roll over each other and change position when thermally agitated. This motion within the crystal lattice, called premelting, increases the entropy of the crystal and effectively stabilizes it. Consequently, more thermal energy is required before the crystal becomes unstable, and T m is raised. Flat or irregularly shaped polymers, with  bends and bumps in the chain, cannot move in this way without disrupting the crystal lattice, and so have lower T m values. This is only one aspect. For crystallite formation in a polymer, easy close-packing of the chains in a regular three-dimensional fashion is required. Again linear symmetrical molecules are best. Polyethylene, poly(tetrafluoroethylene) and other chains with more complex backbones containing ,, and  groups all possess a suitable symmetry for crystallite formation and usually assume extended zig-zag conformations when aligned in the lattice. Chains containing irregular units, which detract from the linear geometry, reduce the ability of a polymer to crystallize. Thus cis-double bonds (I), o- and m-phenylene groups (11), or cis-oriented puckered rings (III), all encourage bending and twisting in the chains  and make regular close-packing very difficult. If, however, the phenylene rings are para-oriented, the chains retain their axial symmetry and can crystallize more readily. Similarly, incorporation of a trans-double bond maintains the chain symmetry. This is highlighted when comparing the amorphous elastomeric cis-polyisoprene with the highly crystalline trans-polyisoprene which has no virtue as an elastomer, or cis-poly(1,3-butadiene) , with trans-poly(1,3-butadiene),. Intermolecular bonding. In polyethylene crystallites, the close packing achieved by the chains allows the van der Waals forces to act co-operatively and provide additional stability to the crystallite. Any interaction between chains in the crystal lattice will help to hold the structure together more firmly and raise the melting temperature. Polymers containing polar groups, e.g. Cl, CN, or OH, can be held rigid, and aligned, in a polymer matrix by the strong dipole-dipole interactions between the substituents, but the effect is most obvious in the symmetrical polyamides. These polymers can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds which greatly enhance crystallite stability. This is illustrated in figure 11.4 for nylon-6,6, where the extended zig-zag conformation is ideally suited to allow regular intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The increased stability is reflected in T m which for nylon-6,6 is 540 K compared with 410 K for polyethylene. The structures of related polyamides do not always lead to this neat arrangement of intermolecular bond formation; for example the geometry of an extended nylon-7,7 chain allows the formation of only every second possible hydrogen bond when the chains are aligned and fully extended. However, the process is so favourable energetically, that sufficient deformation of the chain takes place to enable formation of all possible hydrogen bonds. The added stability that this imparts to the crystallite far outweighs the limited loss of energy caused by chain flexing. Secondary bonds can therefore lead to a stimulation of the crystallization process in the appropriate polymers. Tacticity. Chain symmetry and flexibility both affect the crystallinity of a polymer sample. If a chain possesses large pendant groups, these will increase the rigidity but   also increase the difficulty of close packing to form a crystalline array. This latter problem can be overcome if the groups are arranged in a regular fashion along the chain. Isotactic polymers tend to form helices to accommodate the substituents in the most stable steric positions; these helices are regular forms capable of regular alignment. Thus atactic polystyrene is amorphous but isotactic polystyrene is semi-crystalline . Syndiotactic polymers are also sufficiently regular to crystallize, but not necessarily as a helix, rather in glide planes. Branching in the side group tends to stiffen the chain and raise T m as shown in the series poly(but-1-ene),; poly (3-methyl but-1-ene),; poly (3,3′-dimethyl but-1-ene),. If the side group is flexible and non-polar, T m is lowered. Branching and molar mass. If the chain is substantially branched, the packing efficiency deteriorates and the crystalline content is lowered. Polyethylene provides a good example of this (figure 11.2) where extensive branching lowers the density and T m of the polymer. Molar mass can also alter T m . Chain ends are relatively free to move and if the number of chain ends is increased by reducing the molar mass, then T m is lowered because of the decrease in energy required to stimulate chain motion and melting. For example, polypropylene, with M = 2000 g mol -1 , has , whereas a sample with M = 30 000 g mol -1 , has . 11.7 Morphology and kinetics Having once established that certain polymeric materials are capable of crystallizing, fundamental studies are directed along two main channels of interest centred on (a) the mode and kinetics of crystallization, and (b) the morphology of the sample on completion of the process . Although the morphology depends largely on the crystallizing conditions, we shall consider the macro- and microscopic structure first before dealing with the kinetics of formation. 11.8 Morphology A number of distinct morphological units have been identified during the crystallization of polymers from the melt, which have helped to clarify the mechanism. We shall now discuss the ordered forms which have been identified. Crystallites. In an X-ray pattern produced by a semicrystalline polymer, the discrete maxima observed arise from the scattering by small regions of three-dimensional order, which are called crystallites. They are formed in the melt by diffusion of molecules, or sections of molecules, into close packed ordered arrays; these then crystallize. The sizes of these crystallites are small relative to the length of a fully extended polymer chain, but they are also found to be independent of the molar mass and rarely exceed 1 to 100 nm. As a result, various portions of one chain may become incorporated in more than one crystallite during growth, thereby imposing a strain on the polymer which retards the process of crystallite formation. This will also introduce imperfections in the crystallites which continue growing until the strains imposed by the surrounding crystallites eventually stop further enlargement. Thus a matrix of ordered regions with disordered interfacial areas is formed, but, unlike materials with small molar masses, the ordered and disordered regions are not discrete entities and cannot be separated by differential solution techniques unless the solvent causes selective degradation of the primary bonds in the amorphous regions. Crystallites of cellulose have been isolated from wood pulp in this way by treatment with acid to hydrolyse and remove the amorphous regions. Typical dimensions of the remaining crystallites were 46 nm long by 7.3 nm wide corresponding to bundles of about 100 to 150 chains in each crystallite. The first attempts to explain the crystalline structure of a polymer sample produced a model called the fringe-micelle structure. The chain was envisaged as meandering throughout the system, entering and leaving several ordered regions along its length. The whole structure was thus made up of crystalline regions imbedded randomly in a continuous amorphous matrix. This model has now been virtually discarded in the light of more recent research which has revealed features incompatible with this picture. Single crystals. When a polymer is crystallized from the melt, imperfect polycrystalline aggregations are formed in association with a substantial amorphous content. This is a consequence of chain entanglement and the high viscosity of the melt combining to hinder the diffusion of chains into the ordered arrays necessary for crystallite formation. If these restrictions to free movement are reduced and a polymer is allowed to crystallize from a dilute solution, it is possible to obtain well-defined single crystals. By working with solutions in which the amount of polymer is considerably less than 0.1 per cent the chance of a chain being incorporated in more than one crystal is greatly reduced, thereby increasing the possibility of isolated single crystals being formed. These crystals are usually very small, but they have been detected for a range of polymers including polyesters, polyamides, polyethylene, cellulose acetate, and poly (4-methyl pentene-1). Although small, these single crystals can be studied using an electron microscope. This reveals that they are made up of thin lamellae, often lozenge shaped, sometimes oval, about 10 to 20 nm thick, depending on the temperature of crystallization. The most surprising feature of these lamellae is that while the molecular chains may be as long as 1000 nm, the direction of the chain axis is across the thickness of the platelet. This means that the chain must be folded many times like a concertina to be accommodated in the crystal. For a polymer such as polyethylene, the fold in the chain is completed using only 3 or 4 monomer units with bonds in the gauche conformation. The extended portions in between have about 40 monomers units all in the trans conformation. The crystals, thus formed, have a hollow pyramid shape, because of the requirement that the chain folding must involve a staggering of the chains if the most efficient packing is to be achieved. There is also a remarkable constancy of lamellar thickness, but this increases as the temperature increases. While opinions vary between kinetic and thermodynamic reasons for this constancy of fold distance, it is suggested that the fold structure allows the maximum amount of crystallization of the molecule at a length which produces a free energy minimum in the crystal. One suggestion is that the folding maintains the appropriate kinetic unit of the chain at any given temperature; as this would be expected to lengthen with increasing temperature, it would account for the observed thickening of the lamellae. Hedrites. If the concentration of the polymer solution is increased a crystalline polyhedral structure emerges composed of lamellae joined together along a common plane. These have also been detected growing from a melt which suggests that lamellar growth can take place in the melt and may be a sub-unit of the spherulite. Crystallization from the melt. Whereas crystallization from dilute solutions may result in the formation of single polymer crystals, this perfection is not achieved when dealing with polymers cooled from the melt. The basic characteristic feature is still the lamellar-like crystallite with amorphous surfaces or interfaces, but the way these are formed may be different based on the careful investigation of melt crystallized polymers using neutron scattering techniques. The two models that have been proposed to describe the fine structure of these lamellae and their surface characteristics in semicrystalline polymers, differ mainly in the way the chains are thought to enter and leave the ordered lamellae regions. These are: (a) the regular folded array with adjacent re-entry of the chains, but with some loose folding and emergent chain ends or cilia that contribute to the disordered surface, or (b) the switchboard model, where there is some folding of the chains but re-entry is now quite random. Both are represented schematically in figure 11.5 but the exact nature of the structure has been the subject of considerable controversy. While the morphology of the single crystals grown from dilute solutions may be more regular and resemble the first model, for polymers that are crystallized from the melt (and this is by far the more important procedure technically) the mass of evidence tends to favour a form of the switchboard model. Measurements of the densities of several semicrystalline polymers points to the fact that a significant fraction of the chain units are in a non crystalline environment. This is not consistent with the regular folded form of the crystallites where the amorphous part is associated only with loose folding of the chains and cilia. Even more persuasive are small angle neutron scattering studies. These have demonstrated that the radii of gyration of several semicrystalline polymers remain essentially unchanged on moving from the melt phase to the semicrystalline phase (table 11.2). This means that there is no significant reordering of the chain conformation when crystallization takes place after cooling from the melt, which would be required if a regularly folded chain structure was to be constructed in the lamellae. To explain these observations Fischer has proposed the solidification model in which crystallization is believed to take place by the straightening of sections of the polymer coil followed by alignment of these sequences in regular arrays forming the lamellar structure. This precludes the need for the extensive, long range, diffusion of the chain through a highly viscous medium that would be necessary if a regular chain folded structure was to be constructed. The process is shown schematically in figure 11.6 and the resulting structure is a variation of the switchboard model. This hypothesis can account for the fact that on cooling, rapid crystal growth is seen to occur which is inconsistent with the need for long range diffusion if the regularly folding lamellae were forming. The solidification model shows that the chains can be incorporated into the basic lamellar form with the minimum amount of movement and that there will be extensive meandering of chains between the lamellae forming the interfacial amorphous regions. Spherulites. Examination of thin sections of semicrystalline polymers reveals that the crystallites themselves are not arranged randomly, but form regular birefringent structures with circular symmetry. These structures, which exhibit a characteristic Maltese cross optical extinction pattern, are called spherulites. While spherulites are characteristic of crystalline polymers, they have also been observed to form in low molar mass compounds which are crystallized from highly viscous media. Each spherulite grows radially from a nucleus formed either by the density fluctuations which result in the initial chain ordering process or from an impurity in the system. As the structure is not a single crystal, the sizes found vary from somewhat greater than a crystallite to diameters of a few millimetres. The number, size, and fine structure depend on the temperature of crystallization, which determines the critical size of the nucleating centre. This means that large fibrous structures form near T m , whereas greater numbers of small spherulites grow at lower temperatures. When the nucleation density is high, the spherical symmetry tends to be lost as the spherulite edges impinge on their neighbours to form a mass such as shown in figure 11.7. A study of the fine structure of a spherulite shows that it is built up of fibrous   sub-units, growth takes place by the formation of fibrils which spread outwards from the nucleus in bundles, into the surrounding amorphous phase. As this fibrillar growth advances, branching takes place, and at some intermediate stage in the development, the spherulite often resembles a sheaf of grain. This forms as the fibrils fan out and begin to create the spherical outline. Although the fibrils are arranged radially, the molecular chains lie at right angles to the fibril axis. This has led to the suggestion that the fine structure is created from a series of lamellar crystals winding helically along the spherulite radius. Growth proceeds from a small crystal nucleus which develops into a fibril. Low branching and twisting then produces bundles of diverging and spreading fibrils which eventually fill out into the characteristic spherical structure. In between the branches of the fibrils are amorphous areas and these, along with the amorphous interfacial regions between the lamellae, make up the disordered content of the semi-crystalline polymer (figure 11.8). Spherulites are classified as positive when the refractive index of the polymer chain is greater across the chain than along the axis, and negative when the greater refractive index is in the axial direction. They also show various other features such as zig-zag patterns, concentric rings, and dendritic structures. 11.9 Kinetics of crystallization The crystalline content of a polymer has a profound effect on its properties and it is important to know how the rate of crystallization will vary with the temperature, especially during the processing and manufacturing of polymeric articles. The chemical structure of the polymer is also an important feature in the crystallization; for example, polyethylene crystallizes readily and cannot be quenched rapidly enough to give a largely amorphous sample whereas this is readily accomplished for isotactic polystyrene. However, this aspect will be discussed more fully later. Isothermal crystallization. Two main factors influence the rate of crystallization at any given temperature: (i) the rate of nucleation; and (ii) the subsequent rate of growth of these nuclei to macroscopic dimensions. The kinetic treatment of crystallization from the melt is based on the radial growth of a front through space and can be likened to someone scattering a handful of gravel onto the surface of a pond. Each stone is a nucleus which, when it strikes the surface, generates expanding circles (similar to spherulites in two dimensions). These grow unimpeded for a while but the leading edges eventually collide with others and growth rates are altered. When a similar picture is adopted for the crystallization of a polymer certain basic assumptions are made first. The formation of ordered growth centres by the alignment of chains from the melt is called spontaneous nucleation. When the temperature of crystallization is close to the melting temperature, nucleation is sporadic and only a few large spherulites will  grow. At lower temperatures, nucleation is rapid and a large number of small spherulites are formed. The growth of the spherulites may occur in one, two, or three dimensions and the rate of radial growth is taken to be linear at any temperature. Finally the density ρ c of the crystalline phase is considered to be uniform throughout but different from that of the melt ρ L . A kinetic treatment has been developed taking account of these points. The Avrami equation. The kinetic approach relies on the establishment of a relation between the density of the crystalline and melt phases and the time. This provides a measure of the overall crystallization rate. It is assumed that the spherulites grow from nuclei whose relative positions in the melt remain unaltered, and the analysis allows for the eventual impingement of the growing discs on one another. The final relation describing the process is known as the Avrami equation expressed as  where k is the rate constant, w o and w L are the masses of the melt at zero time and that left after time t. The exponent n is the Avrami exponent and is an integer which can provide information on the geometric form of the growth. Sporadic nucleation is assumed to be a first-order mechanism and if we consider that a two-dimensional disc is formed, then . Rapid nucleation is a zeroth-order process in which the growth centres are formed at the same time, and for each growth unit listed in table 11.3, the corresponding values of the exponent would be . Thus the Avrami exponent is the sum of the order of the rate process and the number of dimensions the morphological unit possesses. Dilatometry. As crystallization involves the close packing of chains in regular three-dimensional structures, the economical use of space is accompanied by an increase in density. Thus the rate of crystallization can be followed by recording the density changes which are readily detected in a dilatometer. This is achieved by placing the polymer in a dilatometer with a confining liquid, such as mercury, so that any volume change can be recorded as a movement of the liquid meniscus in a capillary. A typical design is shown in figure 11.9. The polymer is introduced into the dilatometer between the point A and the capillary. The apparatus is then pumped out and sealed under vacuum at the point A. Sufficient mercury is then added to enclose the polymer and extend into the capillary, after which the tube is sealed at B, and placed in a thermostat at a temperature somewhat higher than the melting temperature of the polymer. When   the sample is completely molten the dilatometer is transferred to a second thermostat set at the temperature selected for crystallization to take place and allowed to equilibrate. The initial period of temperature adjustment to the second temperature may make the initial height h o rather difficult to locate, but usually a plot such as shown in figure 10.9(b) is recorded. If secondary crystallization takes place the final portion of the curve may tail away making h∞ more difficulty to measure. The mass fraction of the uncrystallized polymer  can be related to the volume changes and to the heights measured in the dilatometer by  where h t , h o , and h ∞ are the heights at time t, the beginning, and the end of the process respectively, with V t , V o , and V ∞ the corresponding volumes. The slope of a plot of  against t allows evaluation of the Avrami exponent n while k can be calculated from the intercept. Deviations from Avrami equation. The Avrami equation can describe some but not all systems investigated. The crystallization isotherms of poly (ethylene terephthalate) can be fitted by equation (11.3) using n = 4 above 473 K and n = 2 at 383 K. The equation should be used with caution, however, as non-integer values have been reported and the geometric shape of the morphological unit is not always that predicted by the value of n calculated from the experimental data. Secondary crystallization. Deviations from the Avrami treatment may also be observed towards the end of the crystallization process and values of h∞ are often   difficult to determine accurately, as shown in the curve derived from dilatometric data. The tailing of the curve is a result of a secondary crystallization process which is a slower reorganization of the crystalline regions to produce more perfectly formed crystallites."
ACA ACA-HWV-002 -0.19 "SHORT REPORT Epidemiology of hepatitis E virusinfection in Turkey The seroprevalence and risk factors for infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) were analysed in five regions of Turkey, where one-third of acute hepatitis cases are non-A, non-B. Antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV) were found in 80 (5.9%) of 1350 subjects. Independent predictors of anti-HEV were age over 25 years, less than elementary education, antibodies to hepatitis C virus, and residence in the warmest region (Adana). Whereas none of 105 subjects in the second decade of life were HEV seropositive, 17 (3.7%) of 464 and 28 (9.1%) of 308 of those in the third and fourth decades of life, respectively, had anti-HEV (p < 0.001). These data demonstrate that in Turkey HEV is more prevalent in warmer regions and in adults, beginning in the third decade of life. The major cause of non-parenteral non-A, non-B hepatitis has been identified and named the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Serological evidence of infection with HEV (anti-HEV) has been found in 42% of Egyptian children with non-A, non-B hepatitis and in 71% of persons infected in a waterborne outbreak of non-A, non-B hepatitis in Kashmir, India. However, no large population-based serosurveys of HEV have been reported, and in Turkey, one-third of cases of acute hepatitis were classified as non-A, non-B. From 1990 to 1992, demographic information and serum samples were collected for a study of cardiovascular morbidity from over 8000 persons in five distinct regions of Turkey: Istanbul, a large urban centre in the northwest; Ayvalik, an Aegean coastal town; Aydin, a factory city in the southwest; Trabzon region, rural Black Sea villages in the northeast; and Adana, a warm southeastern city, with an agricultural-based economy. All participants were volunteers responding to the advertised national heart study. Demographic information was collected by medical students administering a questionnaire. In July, 1992, these resources were used to estimate the prevalence of HEV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Turkey. For this study, 300 persons were selected from each of the five regions with stratified random sampling based on gender, age, and income. Serum samples were placed on dry ice and stored at -70°C. Antibodies to HCV were screened with the second-generation Ortho HCV ELISA. All specimens repeatedly positive by this assay were confirmed by second-generation Chiron RIBA HCV. Antibodies to HEV were detected with Diagnostic Biotechnology's HEV ELISA (supplied by Genelabs Technologies). In this assay two recombinant antigens, which correspond to the putative structural region of the ORF3 of HEV, are coated on polystyrene microplate wells to which serum is added. These antigens correlate with the IgG and IgM response to HEV from strains as divergent as the Mexico and Burma isolates. Specimens at or above the minimum positive value were repeated in duplicate. Repeat positive specimens were considered positive. 51 persons were excluded from analysis because of missing data on age, gender, or obesity, and only 201 specimens from the region of Ayvalik were tested for anti-HEV, leaving 1350 persons for subsequent analysis. Odds ratios for HEV were calculated for each covariate separately with or Fisher's tests. Multivariate analysis was by logistic regression with anti-HEV as the dependent variable, starting with age, gender, and location as baseline covariates and with additional covariates added stepwise. Antibodies to HEV were found in 80 (5.9%) of 1350 subjects. Results of univariate analysis are shown in table I.  After multivariate logistic regression, only older age, lower levels of education, HCV infection, and living in Adana region were independent predictors of HEV (table II). To examine further the association of age and anti-HEV, prevalence rates were calculated for each decade. Whereas none of 105 persons in the second decade of life was HEV seropositive, 17 (3.7%) of 464 and 28 (9.1%) of 308 of those in the third and fourth decades of life, respectively, had anti-HEV (p < 0.001). The frequencies for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth decades were 8/141 (5.7%), 14/161 (8.7%), 8/116 (6.9%), and 5/45 (11.1%), respectively. No clusters of HEV occurred when seropositive persons were grouped by last name or street address. Since, as with hepatitis A virus (HAV), HEV is generally transmitted by faecal-oral routes, the increased prevalence of HEV in those with less education was not unexpected. Similar findings have been reported from large outbreaks where poor sanitation led to increased rates of HEV (enteric non-A, non-B hepatitis) in persons of lower socioeconomic strata. HEV differs from HAV in that outbreaks of HEV occur exclusively in countries with warm climates. This observation is consistent with the increased rates of HEV we observed in Adana and Aydin, warmer southern regions with similar population densities. No outbreaks of non-A, non-B hepatitis have been recognised in Adana or Aydin. HEV also differs with HAV in the increased frequency with which infection is observed in adults compared with children. Similar to the situation in developing countries, most Turkish residents are infected with HAV by the second decade of life. However, in our survey none of 105 persons in the second decade of life had anti-HEV. By contrast, we detected anti-HEV in 3.7% and 9.1% of those in the third and fourth decades of life. Although cases of HEV have been clinically and serologically documented in children, our findings are consistent with reports from several large outbreaks where high rates of HEV (enteric non-A, non-B) were reported in adults, beginning in the late second and third decades of life. The increased detection of anti-HEV in adults in our study could reflect a cohort of Turkish residents infected with HEV in the past and a younger generation unexposed to virus, due perhaps to improvements in sanitation. Alternatively, anti-HEV titres in subjects infected as children but not re-exposed as adults could have diminished beyond detection."
ACA ACA-HWV-004 -0.01 "COMMENTARY DRUG REACTIONS Sumatriptan and chest pain Clinical studies in over 12,000 patients have confirmed the efficacy of sumatriptan in migraine and cluster headaches. This potent and selective 5HTID receptor agonist has predominantly cranial vasoconstrictor effects in animal and human studies and can be given subcutaneously (6 mg) or orally (100 mg). Sensations of heaviness, pressure, and tightness at different sites, including chest and neck, recorded in 3–5% of patients suggest some extracranial vasoactivity. During early clinical studies, 1 patient experienced cardiac ischaemic events, so a detailed safety programme was initiated (a) to assess the cardiovascular effects;(b) to analyse reports of possible cardiac complications; and (c) to conduct extensive electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring during trials. Extracranial cardiovascular activity was suggested by increases in blood pressure of 12/10 mm Hg observed 10 min after subcutaneous sumatriptan and lasting for 30–60 min. A lesser effect (7/5 mm Hg) of longer duration was seen with oral therapy. Detailed invasive haemodynamic investigations have now shown increased vascular resistance in both systemic and pulmonary circulations, with an increase in aortic systolic and diastolic pressures of 17–20% and 12–16%, respectively, and a relatively greater rise in pulmonary systolic and diastolic pressures of 40–50% and 33–77%. The increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 90% points to additional venoconstrictive effects. These results suggest either that 5HT receptors are more widely distributed than previously recognised or that sumatriptan is less specific in its agonist activity. In-vitro studies in human epicardial arteries confirm 5HT-like receptor activity. Maximum vasoconstriction following sumatriptan is only 21% of that seen with 5HT (serotonin). The in-vivo effects were investigated in patients with chest pain but with less than critical coronary artery obstruction (stenosis <50%). After intravenous sumatriptan, mean absolute diameter was reduced by 14 (SD 10) % vs a 16% reduction with subcutaneous administration. There was no ECG evidence of myocardial ischaemia despite symptoms of chest tingling and tightness. When serotonin was given into coronary arteries there was a 52% increase in cross-sectional area in normal arteries, a 64% reduction in patients with angina, and total occlusion in subjects with Prinzmetal angina. The reduction in cross-sectional area is at least two-fold greater than with sumatriptan. The ergot alkaloids given therapeutically in migraine have been used as a diagnostic test for coronary artery vasospasm, with a diffuse reduction in arterial diameter of about 30% evident in normal arteries. The vasoconstrictor effect is accentuated with minor arteriosclerotic disease and total occlusion may occur. In migraineurs, dihydroergotamine therapy has resulted in 18 reported cases of myocardial infarction, with death in 3. 2 patients had a history of cardiac disease. 75% were less than 50 years of age, 83% were women, and 78% had no risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. Thus, the coronary vasoconstrictive effect of sumatriptan seems to be less than that of serotonin or the ergot alkaloid, which show additional 5HT and alpha-receptor stimulation. Inman and Kubota observed patients with chest tightness and suggested that asthma might be induced by sumatriptan. From the clinical database of 75 trials held by Glaxo, who manufacture sumatriptan, 375 asthmatics have been identified who had been treated for 1214 migraine episodes. Only 1 of 6 observed episodes of asthma was believed by the clinical investigators to be related to therapy. Chest tightness may indicate stimulation of pulmonary vascular receptors with pulmonary vasoconstriction rather than bronchoconstriction. Coronary vasoconstriction has been suggested by several case-reports but full cardiac investigations have seldom been carried out. Willett et al reported ST-T wave changes of Prinzmetal character 4 min after subcutaneous sumatriptan in a 47-year-old man. This patient had a history of chest pain, although a negative exercise test had been recorded 7.5 months before the episode. Underlying obstructive coronary artery disease was not excluded by angiography. Curtin et al reported ventricular fibrillation in a 42-year-old woman within 3 min of injection, thought to have been induced by vasospasm. Subsequent investigations confirmed a normal 24 h ECG recording but an exercise test suggested an ischaemic response and coronary arteriography showed a 40% obstructive lesion. This patient had experienced several episodes of palpitations although she was otherwise well. Ottervanger et al reported a myocardial infarction in a 47-year-old woman after subcutaneous sumatriptan. The ECG showed changes of inferior infarction on admission but strangely no ST elevation; this pattern suggests a previous event or rapid spontaneous coronary artery reperfusion. She had noted chest pain after two previous injections. A subsequent exercise test showed possible ischaemic changes. Of 6124 patients with 28,648 attacks, 2150 had ECGs within 4 h of oral or subcutaneous therapy and 5388 had ECGs at some stage (Glaxo data). Although 4.6% had pressure symptoms, 99% had no ECG changes. Non-specific changes were seen in 27 (0.5%); new changes of possible myocardial ischaemia occurred in 10 (0.2%) and 5 were believed to be related to sumatriptan (0.1%). The ECG change was associated with angina in only 1 case. In the subset of oral studies, ECGs were obtained in 1733 of 2786 patients with 24,000 attacks. No irreversible ECG changes were seen, although pressure symptoms occurred in 4.4%. These studies show that the frequency of ECG changes is very low. Overall, there is a small risk of myocardial ischaemia following sumatriptan-induced vasoconstriction. The drug is contraindicated in patients with symptomatic ischaemic heart disease with either angina or an earlier myocardial infarction, or if silent ischaemia or Prinzmetal angina has been documented previously. In patients who are symptom free but at risk of atheroma — eg, postmenopausal women; men over 40; individuals with risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, obesity, diabetes, or tobacco smoking; and those with a strong family history — one should consider giving the first dose of sumatriptan under medical supervision. If sumatriptan induces symptoms suggestive of angina, nitrates should be given. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Antenatal interventions against sexually transmitted disease in Africa In a recent review of the effectiveness of antenatal interventions, the World Health Organization gave high priority to identifying the best ways of ensuring the availability of measures to prevent syphilis and gonorrhoea in women. The possible strategies included screening, treatment, follow-up, and health education. Such measures are required urgently in Africa, where the prevalence and complications of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) remain disturbingly high. In Africa, the high overall incidence of STDs, fuelled by lack of effective STD control, means that antenatal interventions are unlikely to be very effective if they are not matched by equivalent or corresponding measures to control STDs in the general population. Moreover, the low attendance by female patients at existing STD clinics raises several questions — eg, what proportion of STDs detected antenatally represent pre-existing symptomless infection (as a consequence of lack of partner notification) and what proportion are acquired during pregnancy? Successful antenatal intervention largely depends on the proportion, frequency, and pattern of attendance at antenatal clinics, so there is need for strategies to overcome cultural, demographic, and socioeconomic barriers to early and continued attendance. Nevertheless, the availability of reliable diagnostic tests and effective treatment for syphilis and gonorrhoea means that there is enormous potential and scope for reducing both their prevalence and their complications during pregnancy. There are two main options:(a) routine antibiotic prophylaxis; and (b) case-detection through screening. Although antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce complications of some genital infections in pregnancy, the benefits are not unqualified. The data come mainly from industrialised countries where the pattern of STDs differs from that in Africa. In addition, there are obstacles to routine antibiotic prophylaxis in Africa. In view of the financial constraints, it would be hard to justify the cost of such prophylaxis for all pregnant women in order to cover 7–10%. An important consideration is that multiple drug resistance has rendered many low-cost drugs useless for this purpose. After a course of antibiotics in pregnancy, women will still be vulnerable to reinfection via sexual intercourse, while extension of prophylaxis to their spouses would double the cost without necessarily guaranteeing improved efficacy. Furthermore, blind use of antibiotics on such a large scale and the attendant difficulties with compliance might well aggravate the problem of drug resistance. Case-detection through antenatal screening may have logistic, financial, and manpower impediments to implementation but it remains the favoured strategy. The inability of many African countries to sustain large-scale routine screening for gonorrhoea with conventional methods is the main obstacle to antenatal screening for the infection. The search for cheap but reliable mass screening tests and accurate diagnostic algorithms has so far been fruitless, so case-finding based on clinical suspicion will continue to be the most important strategy. By contrast, the availability of simple, rapid, reliable, and cheap screening tests for syphilis makes this STD amenable to routine antenatal screening. A demonstration project in Zambia has shown that such screening is achievable and might significantly reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Mandatory antenatal screening for syphilis could be the first major antenatal intervention against STDs; full integration of this policy into antenatal care could provide an avenue for research into pertinent questions raised in the recent WHO review and an opportunity to identify women who need evaluation for other STDs. The costs of the programme could be controlled by coordinated use of facilities and personnel in antenatal and STD clinics and laboratories. NEUROSURGERY Surgical excision for single cerebral metastasis? In a patient with a single symptomatic metastasis in an accessible area of the brain and an otherwise reasonable outlook, the neurosurgeon may contemplate surgical excision. The usually good demarcation of tumour from normal brain allows a clean removal, quickly relieves symptoms of intracranial hypertension, and frequently improves of signs of focal brain dysfunction. Patient outcome depends largely on the extracranial disease; the tumour seldom recurs at the site of a clean excision. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement facilitates the diagnosis of single lesions, but in some cases will reveal multiple metastases, which are a contraindication to surgical treatment. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy has made surgery much safer, both for tumour biopsy and for excision. Before the introduction of steroid treatment, surgical biopsy without the decompression afforded by removal of the tumour carried a prohibitive morbidity and mortality. The combination of steroids and CT-directed stereotactic brain biopsy has profoundly reduced the morbidity of the procedure: Thomas and Nouby reported mortality of 0.3% and morbidity of 4% in 300 cases, including tumours in the brainstem. Thus all solitary mass lesions in the brain can be located and verified histologically and histochemically, as they should be, before a decision on treatment. The increased safety of biopsy under steroid cover also means that one can contemplate radiotherapy as a safe treatment on its own — producing improvement in 60% of cases — rather than as an adjunct to surgical excision of the metastasis. So, what is the best treatment for the patient with a solitary cerebral metastasis — biopsy and radiotherapy, or surgical excision and radiotherapy? The answer has not proved easy. The outcome of non-randomised studies has been influenced by the fact that the patients selected for surgery tend to be those in good overall condition with a favourable systemic prognosis. Now we have evidence from two prospective randomised studies in which surgical excision followed by radiotherapy was compared with radiotherapy alone in similar groups of steroid-treated patients with a single histologically identified brain metastasis, reasonable neurological function, and a life-expectancy greater than 6 months. In a study by Patchell et al, surgical excision and subsequent radiotherapy in 25 patients was followed by local recurrence in 5 cases vs 12 local recurrences in 23 patients treated by radiotherapy alone. Median survival was 40 weeks and functional independent survival 38 weeks in the surgical group vs 15 and 8 weeks, respectively, in the non-surgical group. Vecht et al report a randomised study of 63 patients and confirm significantly longer overall and functionally independent survival in the surgically treated patients. The results of these latest trials indicate the continuing need for close cooperation between neurosurgeons, pathologists, and radiation oncologists in the management of cancers that metastasise to the brain, not only to provide biopsy material for histological diagnosis but also to carry out excisional surgery in appropriate cases. ONCOLOGY Chromosomal deletions in haematological malignancies Haemopoiesis entails the differentiation of self-renewing pluripotential stem cells into a hierarchy of progenitor cells committed to one or more lineages. These progenitors subsequently give rise to at least nine distinct differentiated cell types. Haematological malignancies arise as a result of acquired mutations which disturb the normal balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Characterisation of these mutations might be expected to tell us something about the normal regulation of haemopoiesis. Two broad categories of tumorigenic genetic lesions are now well recognised:(a) activation of proto-oncogenes; and (b) loss or inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes. Proto-oncogenes activated in tumours derived from a particular haemopoietic lineage are often functionally altered or ectopically expressed. Their study, although greatly increasing our understanding of tumorigenesis, has provided little information about normal haemopoietic mechanisms. By contrast, tumour-suppressor genes inactivated in tumours affecting a certain haemopoietic lineage are presumably expressed during the normal differentiation of the lineage, so their characterisation is likely to provide direct insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating such differentiation. Tumour-suppressor genes have been implicated in an increasing number of solid cancers, and some of these genes have subsequently been found to be inactivated in haematological malignancies. Thus, structural abnormalities of the retinoblastoma gene have been found in as many as 30% of some forms of leukaemia and lymphoma and mutations of the p53 gene have been reported as an infrequent event in myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia. However cytogenetic deletions at other chromosomal sites are well recognised in several haematological malignancies and are thought to flag the site of novel tumour suppressor genes. Deletions of two distinct regions of 6q have been identified in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma but the target genes are not yet known. Deletions of 9p occur in 7–13% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This region of chromosome 9 contains the cluster of interferon- genes and the interferon-1 gene. Diaz et al have shown homozygous or hemizygous loss of the interferon genes in 29% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but it is unclear whether the critical target gene is one of the interferon genes or another locus nearby. Similarly, deletions of 13q14 in low-grade B-cell tumours may be associated with hemizygous or homozygous loss of the retinoblastoma gene. However, recent evidence suggests that the crucial event is loss of an uncharacterised neighbouring locus. Much attention has lately been focused on the 5q deletion associated with myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukaemia. Van den Berghe and colleagues originally drew attention to the deletion of 5q in elderly female patients with macrocytic anaemia, normal or raised platelet counts, hypolobulated megakaryocytes, and a low risk of leukaemic transformation. This particular form of myelodysplasia was termed the ‘5q syndrome’. Deletions of 5q and 7q are now know to be among the commonest chromosomal abnormalities found in myelodysplasia and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia. Moreover, a whole battery of growth factors, cell surface receptors, and other tantalising genes have been mapped to the region encompassed by most 5q deletions. In 1991, homozygous loss of the gene encoding the M-CSF receptor (also known as FMS or CSF-1 receptor) was shown in 4 of 10 patients with a cytogenetically detectable 5q deletion. The remaining chromosome 5 appeared normal but presumably contained a submicroscopic microdeletion in a subpopulation of cells. Could FMS itself be the target gene? FMS is expressed in myeloid cells and FMS mutations are found in myelodysplasia. However, there have not been any reports of point mutations in the remaining FMS allele in patients with a 5q deletion. Even if FMS does not prove to be the critical target gene, characterisation of the microdeletions should considerably reduce the critical deleted region and provide a major step to identifying the real target gene. The latest twist is provided by the identification of an alternative candidate gene. The IRF-1 gene encodes a transcription factor that functions as a transcriptional activator of interferon-, interferon-, and other interferon inducible genes. Willman and co-workers looked for loss of IRF-1 and several flanking genes in 12 patients with myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia associated with cytogenetic abnormalities of 5q31. IRF-1 was the only one of these genes consistently deleted in all of these patients. Furthermore, a rearrangement of the IRF-1 gene was identified in one additional patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. These researchers suggest that IRF-1 itself could be the target gene in 5q deletions and cite two further observations as indirect support for this concept. First, interferon gene deletions have previously been associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and it would, therefore, not be too surprising to find that abnormalities of interferon regulation or of the interferon signalling pathway were tumorigenic. Second, in vitro experiments have shown that the balance between the transcriptional activator IRF-1 and its antagonistic repressor, IRF-2, plays a crucial part in controlling cell growth. Overexpression of IRF-2 is tumorigenic, an effect that can be inhibited by increasing the expression of IRF-1. These experiments provide functional evidence that IRF-1 has the potential to act as a tumour-suppressor gene. Nevertheless, direct evidence implicating IRF-1 as the critical target gene in 5q deletions remains sparse. The only structural abnormality of IRF-1 was found in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a disease not normally associated with 5q deletions. The significance of this rearrangement for the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies associated with 5q deletions remains unclear. These results raise several questions. Perhaps the most important is whether the FMS and IRF-1 data can be reconciled. FMS and IRF-1 are separated by an estimated 5–12 megabases and microdeletions that include one are unlikely to include the other. One possible explanation would be the existence of two distinct target genes on 5q, one in the region of IRF-1 and the other close to FMS. This speculation would accord with the fact that some patients with myelodysplasia and a 5q deletion have a very low risk of transformation (eg, 5q syndrome) whereas in other myelodysplasia patients a 5q deletion is associated with poor prognosis (eg, secondary MDS). These examples illustrate the central problem of characterising chromosomal deletions — how do you know when you have identified the target gene? Searching for mutations in a candidate gene probably remains the best approach, albeit a labour-intensive one. However, once identified, the target genes should be doubly interesting since they promise to shed light not only on the pathogenesis of haematological malignancies but also on the normal regulation of haemopoietic differentiation."
ACA ACA-HXH-001 -0.03 "Deciding what to write about, and getting started 1.1 THE PURPOSE OF WRITING ESSAYS As prescribed coursework, essays in literary studies generally require you to carry out two related tasks. First, they invite you to show that you are familiar with the basic, raw material which makes up the subject — whether this is a work, a series of works, a literary theory, the historical context of an author or what critics have said about something. Secondly, they invite you to show that you can manipulate that basic, raw material to argue a case, in ways consistent with established frameworks of literary-critical debate. Many students' essays demonstrate that their writers know the relevant material; however, the essays do not demonstrate this knowledge within a coherent or developing argument. Such essays are usually judged to be lacking a necessary dimension for achieving high marks. So the second task of essay-writing — arguing a case — is important. But what does ""arguing a case"" mean for a literary studies essay? Much of this book is devoted to showing in detail what ""arguing a case"" means in literary studies; and the notion of ""argument"" will recur in the chapters which follow. Here we need only to establish a rough and preliminary guide. Arguing a case involves the following four stages: — identifying a problem or issue in a given area; — establishing competing points of view associated with the issue identified; — presenting evidence in support of and against various positions which might be taken up with regard to the issue; — reaching a conclusion consistent with the evidence and arguments you have presented. It is the fundamental skills of problem-identification, analysis and debate which are usually perceived by examiners and potential employers as the main achievement of literary studies. The persuasive and analytic skills you develop are applied during your course to literary works and issues; but they have the additional value that they are potentially transferable to other problems and circumstances. Alongside the development of these skills, the subject matter of your essays offers an additional benefit. Because it is concerned with questions of meaning, social behaviour and structure, and problems of cultural value, it directs you not only towards a wide range of examples of writing but also towards a greater awareness of moral and social questions underlying the techniques through which analysis and persuasion are achieved. Once this basic way of tackling literary studies is clear, many of the more specific problems facing you as you answer an exam question or devise an essay topic will begin to fall into place. With the larger objectives slightly clearer, what you have to do is to work out how these are achievable in terms of the wide array of topics presented to you, or in terms of possible topics you are invited to define for yourself. 1.2 WHAT SORTS OF TOPICS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE In most cases, when you write an essay you largely decide for yourself what to write about. Even where you have to answer set questions — as in an exam — a choice between alternatives usually has to be made; and not only do you have to pick a particular question to answer, but you also have to decide exactly what it is that the question is asking you to do. In deciding what a question involves, you need first to identify where it fits into the range of ESSAY GENRES (or ""essay idioms"" ) which are defined by the conventions of literary studies as a discipline. Once you can identify where it fits, you have a general framework in which to tackle it — or which you can challenge if you wish to. We begin this chapter, accordingly, by looking at the different types of literary essay it is possible to write, considering first the variety of focus they give to their subject matter and the different modes of argument they adopt. A literature essay always has a focus for its subject matter (e.g. on the novels of Angela Carter, the role of ""fool"" characters in drama, or the origins of free verse), and it also uses a particular mode of argument (e.g. stylistic analysis, contrast and comparison, or historical contextualisation). To begin with, then, we need to identify the different kinds of focus and modes of argument that are possible, so that you can gain a general sense  of the elements which are combined together in an essay in literary studies. focus (i): Authors examples ""The life and works of Edgar Allen Poe"" ; ""women Romantic poets"" . focus (ii): Texts examples Coleridge's ""Kubla Khan"" ; Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man; poems by Sylvia Plath. focus (iii): Generic groupings of texts examples The sonnet; eighteenth-century pastoral poetry; kitchen-sink drama. focus (iv): Historical issues relating to a selected text or group of texts: examples The specifically nineteenth-century idea of beauty in the nineteenth-century novel; developments in the theatre immediately before the English Civil War; representations of industrial life in early twentieth-century novels. focus (v): Theoretical issues relating to literary study: examples Comparison of post-structuralist approaches to the lyric poem; the mental processes involved in construing a metaphor; why it is possible to have manipulations of point-of-view in narrative. Consider now the various kinds of argument which can be used in approaching these points of focus in your material and making something new and interesting from them: mode of argument (a): Revalue a reputation (or assess relative achievement); example An extended essay which argues that Josephine Tey is a major Scottish writer, and that she has been neglected because she wrote detective fiction. mode of argument (b): Analyse style: comment on aspects of the language of a text. example An essay pointing out that Shakespeare's first sonnet ends with a comma in the first printed edition and arguing that this is because it is the first part of a larger poem including also the second sonnet. mode of argument (c): Relate a text to the historical circumstances which produced it, or in which it is read. example A dissertation which looks at the relation between the spread of tourism in the countryside in the eighteenth century and the development of a new style of ""countryside"" poetry as exemplified in Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads published near the end of that century. mode of argument (d): Place a text in a literary or aesthetic context (e.g. in a tradition, in the emergence of a new form or style). example A thesis arguing that Robert Louis Stevenson should be understood as an early example of twentieth-century Modernism rather than as a late example of nineteenth-century Realism. mode of argument (e): Describe or interpret (or reinterpret) a text. For example, you could interpret the meanings of events in a narrative, starting with a description of what happens at an apparently realistic level, then interpreting the events as having an alternative, symbolic meaning. Description and/or interpretation includes some of the kinds of activity involved in an exercise called ""Practical Criticism"" , which entails commenting on prose passages and poems. example An essay which describes the narrative of Alasdair Gray's novel Lanark and interprets it as a symbolic representation of the state of contemporary Scotland. mode of argument (f): Take sides in an ongoing critical argument between differing viewpoints. Summarise the different cases made in a controversy, then conclude by taking one side or another. Since critical controversies can surround virtually any aspect of a text or movement, essays along these lines can take many forms. example A thesis which investigates made-up words (which resemble slips of the tongue) in Joyce's Finnegans Wake, compares literary theoretical approaches with experimental psychological approaches, and concludes that the psychological approaches undermine the validity of the literary theoretical approaches. mode of argument (g): Exemplify theories, terms or approaches, or use a classificatory system to describe a text (usually in order to reflect back on how suitable or effective the descriptive system is). example An essay showing that the linguistic theory of Conversational Analysis can help us understand how characters in Conrad's novels control each other through the ways they interact in speech. A simple combination of a selected focus with one of the modes of argument outlined above would be an essay with a focus on Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man [focus (ii)], which argues that it is underrated as a novel and indicates why it should be seen as a greater achievement [mode of argument (a)]. More than one focus can be adopted in any given essay, and different modes of argument can be combined; the evaluation of Invisible Man could involve a stylistic argument, so combining mode of argument (a) and mode of argument (b). But while a single essay might draw in this way on more than one perspective, it is important to establish which is the primary or organising mode of argument and what is the primary focus around which an essay is based. Otherwise you may obscure the development of your essay by failing to distinguish its overall direction. Many essays suffer from exactly this problem: they lack a clear sense of what the main issues are which are being addressed. Other essays are damaged by what appears to be an opposite problem, but is actually a result of the same lack of structure: they read as if they are trying to solve two or more problems at once. RESPONDING TO SET QUESTIONS If you have to devise your own topic, you can do so by selecting and combining from the lists of different approaches above. But even when you are constrained by having to answer a question set for you, it is useful to bear in mind the range of possible essay genres, so that you can decide exactly which combination of focus and mode of argument you are required to adopt. Finding an appropriate form in which to present your argument is a major part of the process of writing an essay, and our aim in these sections is to help you develop strategies for making sure that your essay has a directed and coherent structure. Coursework and examination questions are an idiom in themselves. The idiom is worth learning to understand in order to develop a sense of how you should respond to the (often hidden) questions inside an examination or coursework question. Here are some words which are commonly used in essay and exam questions, grouped according to the basic types of writing which they might be asking you to do. In this book we will look at the kinds of things you have to do to respond to each type of question. This is partly a matter of writing appropriate sentences, for example, so that you can distinguish your point of view in debate from someone else's. And it is partly a matter of organising paragraphs — how, for example, to organise a comparison. And it is partly a matter of knowing where to find help: how to find examples and how to work out all the possibilities of a classification. In the meantime, note the following features of the use of the words listed above. The term ""discuss"" invites debate, where debate means reasoned presentation of arguments for and against a proposition, with a conclusion — no matter how qualified or tentative — reached at the end. Words like ""explain"" , ""justify"" and ""assess"" are used to focus your attention on causation and evidence; you should not only describe what you have read but also offer an analysis of why you take the view of it you do.  ""Give examples"" (or the related, ""with reference to not less than two texts…"" ) invites you to present concrete illustration, which should generally include quotation and paraphrase (of episodes or incidents from the text) to support the points you make. We can accordingly make a general summary of the tasks you are being invited to perform in response to essay questions. You are to discuss a proposition, offering and evaluating arguments with appropriate illustration on different sides; the arguments should lead towards a conclusion which (1) follows the arguments you have offered, and (2) matches the balance of possibilities which you argued for in your essay. 1.4 EXAM QUESTIONS It is helpful to bear in mind these recurrent instruction words ( ""discuss"" , ""assess"" , etc.) as you contemplate in an examination a list of questions that you have to choose between. But it is also necessary to link up these instruction words with other aspects of questions. So in this section, we look more closely at how whole exam questions (illustrated here from  recent University of London examination papers) are structured, before considering some more general exam-room strategies. There are several different categories of exam questions:(a) Questions on given passages How appropriate is the form/style of the following passage? By what means, stylistic and other, does the author attempt to establish the character of the narrator in the following passage? Write a critical analysis of the following poem. Diction, rhythm, rhyme and syntax may be of special interest. Often you will be asked in this sort of question to discuss passages you have not seen before. But since the examination is testing what skills you have developed over time, the passage is likely to be similar in some way to passages which you have seen. Sometimes the similarity is hinted at in the question itself; for example, you may have looked at another passage involving characterisation and this will guide you in looking at this one. But while you will usually be expected to remember other pieces you have seen before — and how you analysed them — you should not discuss those other passages in your answer (unless you are explicitly instructed to, which none of the above questions do). Use what you have learned only as background, or as a model; concentrate on isolating suitable phrases or passages for comment, and on drawing general observations from them. (b) Questions which explicitly invite debate, and the weighing of evidence (these might be called ""to what extent"" or ""discuss"" questions)  ""Bakhtin's dialogic reading can defuse scepticism about the possibility of meaning.""  Discuss.  ""Feminism involves both the affirmation and the critique of female identity.""  Discuss. To what extent should Heaney's poetry be described and assessed in terms drawn from his own critical essays? Even if the question doesn't specifically warn you about it, by saying ""to what extent…"" , you should generally find that the answer is not at one end or the other, but somewhere in the middle. And be especially careful with formulations of the kind illustrated in the examples below; do not be misled by a direct interrogative — the answer is never just a long version of ""yes"" or ""no"" :  ""Psychoanalytic criticism can merge with other kinds of reading without supplanting them: it can underpin without undermining.""  Have you found this to be so? Is ""warm-heartedness"" an adequate epitome of Dickens's social theory? Can there be a ""science of the text"" ? Some writers on such questions unwisely respond with aggressive disagreement to the proposition being put. Unwisely, because the question doesn't usually involve a genuine opinion, but rather a constructed or quoted one which is being used to provoke reaction. (The examiners are asking you to show that you have a view and can justify it, whatever it is; they are not asking to be attacked for holding the view outlined in the question, which they probably don't hold anyway.) (c) Other specific types of question In what ways can Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry be regarded as subversive? With this type of question, be careful not just to make a list. Pay particular attention to the relationship between the different ways you identify, and be as explicit as you can about the connections between them. Differentiate the mimetic and/or dramaturgic procedures used in two or more of Shakespeare's last plays. With this type of question, you are asked to identify and compare. As you do so, try to build up a system of classification, explaining your basis for making distinctions. Are Shakespeare's last plays more concerned with the absence of families or with absent families? With such questions, a major task lies in unpacking the word-play, and making clear the distinctions you are drawing from the formulation of the question. You could begin your essay by acknowledging this and continue to work with the definitions throughout the essay, relating the different definitions together in the conclusion. Consider some of the expressive purposes of the rendition of places in Henry James's work. This question only asks you to consider ""some"" of James's expressive purposes. Words like ""some"" in examination questions are there to show that examiners don't think exhaustive answers are possible; any response will be partial. But this does not mean you should limit yourself in how many expressive purposes you discuss. Discuss all the ""expressive purposes"" you can think of. (d) General invitations — but to what? Write on Jonson's use of location in any three of his works. Write on Milton's humour. With these apparently vague questions it is necessary to make clear your own interpretation of what ""write"" means. Roughly, you can take it as synonymous with ""describe and discuss"" . The special difficulty here is that since relatively little essay structure is signalled by the question itself, in your first paragraph you will have to make very clear to your examiner what shape you are imposing on your discussion. (e) Complex questions ""In natural objects we feel ourselves, or think of ourselves, only by likenesses — among men too often by differences"" (Coleridge). In the light of this statement consider the presentation of the relationship between the self and the world in the work of any one writer of the period. This rather convoluted question fits a particular pattern which it is useful to familiarise yourself with:(a) a quote captures a general perception; then (b) you are asked about some other writer (or invited to select a writer) where it is plausible to think the quote may be relevant; then (c) you are asked to discuss this second writer in the light of the quote. Note that your essay in this case is not centrally concerned with Coleridge; in fact you will almost certainly do less well if you write about Coleridge than if you discuss a different author. We can sum up this discussion of exam questions with the following pieces of guidance (in Chapter 5, we consider in more detail how you actually write the passages which perform the functions we suggest here): * Write an introductory paragraph, but don't use it as a way to put off answering the question. Instead, use the first paragraph as an opportunity to translate the question into your own words. But don't use the same wording as in the question and don't translate ""word for word"" ; reformulation and reorganisation will force you to understand the question and show your examiner that you do. Translate technical words into ordinary language wherever possible. * Where a question seems broad or general, explain how you are interpreting it in order to make it more manageable. * The question may not tell you to give examples, but you should, and you should show how the examples relate to your answer. * The question may not directly ask you for a conclusion, but give one anyway. * Don't talk about yourself or comment on the exam unless you are explicitly asked to. 1.5 EXAM TECHNIQUES AND STRATEGIES Writing an exam answer is like writing a homework essay question, with some differences which point to strategies you should learn. It is helpful, for example, to look at past questions, bearing in mind that there is usually only a limited range of possible questions which are likely to be asked about any given topic. In the examination itself, divide up the time on the basis of how the marks are likely to be distributed; if you run out of time for your first answer, quickly sketch a conclusion and move on to the next question, so that you have provided at least a general indication of work in all the questions. (More marks are typically lost by failing to write one answer altogether than by presenting two or three answers which are slightly weaker than you would have wished.) Keep your paper tidy (for example, by deleting all notes at the end), but don't use correcting fluid to remove errors (it is a sure way of telling your examiner that you want to focus on appearance at the expense of content). By way of general preparation, it can also be useful to prepare material in component prefabricated ""packages"" before the exam itself. When you come to answer an exam question, remember that it is probably asking you to carry out a number of different tasks. Begin by jotting down what you think they are, plus any thoughts this triggers off. This stage resembles planning your essay outline, and could give you your necessary paragraph headings (particularly since an exam essay gives room for only a few paragraphs). The question is now in simpler units which you can address in turn. These might include: — problems put into the formulation of the question — words which need definition or explanation, for example; — established views on the issue raised by the question, which you will have learned about in the class or by your own reading; — examples which you can use to illustrate specific points (list the points which each example illustrates); — crucial technical terms which you need to introduce (e.g. an appropriate vocabulary for describing the rhyme scheme of a poem); — historical context which needs to be introduced in order to answer a question about a writer from an earlier period. Establish in your mind the scope and boundaries of the material which will be relevant, bearing in mind the formulation of the question ( ""choose two plays by Shakespeare"" , etc.). Divide up the time available for the question, so that your answer, though short, is still properly proportioned. 1.6 DEVISING YOUR OWN TITLE The titles you choose for essays you devise yourself can, if you want them to, be made closely to resemble the sorts of questions you are set as prescribed essays or in exams. Accordingly, when you have identified the areas in common, and the divergences, between exam questions and essay topics of your own, you can draw appropriately on skills you have learnt in one kind of work while doing another. With this in mind, we now consider some of the distinct characteristics of essay titles. A title is a statement encapsulating the main points of an argument; in most cases, it could be rewritten in the form of a question that is being answered by your essay. The title Undervalued achievement: the contribution of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction. could be used for an essay which is an answer to the question Assess the contribution made by Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction. or to the question ""The contribution made by Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction is undervalued.""  Discuss. In this way, titles can be the mirror image of examination questions. They are phrases which indicate a topic of interest (i.e. your focus) and at the same time point towards a particular kind of discussion (i.e. your mode of argument). Accordingly, your title needs not only to indicate what the essay will be about, but also the point of view it will adopt concerning whatever it is about. In the example above, the phrase ""Undervalued achievement"" does this. There are certain typical characteristics of the form of essay and dissertation titles which you can build on. Note, for example, the common form ""title plus sub-title"" : The Text and the Reader: Construction of meaning in advertising texts (title of a Master's thesis). Marx and Spenser: Elizabeth and the problem of Imperial Power (draft title of a PhD thesis). The formula here involves the combination of two different styles: a main title, in a verbally adroit, catchy form; and a gloss or explanatory paraphrase, couched in more orthodox academic language. In devising titles, avoid over-florid forms, however, as well as epigraphs (i.e.  quotations placed between the title and the main body of text), since these can make the essay appear to aspire to a grandeur or scale that it cannot in the circumstances fulfil. Such titles and ornamentation can create the effect of bathos, or comic undermining of what you do achieve. The same applies to acknowledgements (and other devices common in full-length books) if they are used in short essays. If in doubt, keep it simple. As possible alternatives to the ""title plus sub-title"" pattern, consider whether your own title could be a phrase or sentence. Compare: How readers construct the meaning of advertising texts. A Marxist analysis of the imperialist politics of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene Simply formulating a title of some sort can be a useful achievement, in that it helps you decide how you want to focus your writing. As you write the essay you may find that the focus shifts, with the result that you end up rejecting the original title and finding a more suitable one. This common experience recommends the approach to writing which says that you should start immediately by writing your ideas down, being prepared to discard them later when your thinking has evolved beyond your early plan. More generally, it illustrates how everything you do — even your choice of a title — is a part of your thinking about your essay, and contributes to its development. 1.7 BEING ORIGINAL Whatever you write, it should be in some sense original. But ""originality"" presents a difficult problem because (unless you are doing advanced research) you are unlikely to be in a position to advance new facts or radically new interpretations, or even to have a wide enough knowledge of what other people have written to be sure that you are not duplicating it. This is especially likely to be the case with short essays and exam answers, where you clearly cannot be expected to be ""original"" in the sense in which a researcher or expert in the field might be expected to be. But you will, nevertheless, be expected to be original in the sense of using your own knowledge and independent judgement to argue an original case. Your case gains its originality from the way in which you compare and weigh the different strengths and weaknesses of existing arguments in relation to the text or texts being discussed, and by choosing different examples from those presented in works you have read or lectures you have attended. Faced with the challenge of being original in this way, some student writers believe that they should copy or adapt other people's work because it is bound to be of better quality than their own. This is inappropriate for a number of reasons: first, because you are primarily assessed on relative quality ( ""good for a second-year dissertation"" ) rather than absolute quality; second, because there is no point in simply rewriting someone else's ideas (you might as well submit their original book or article instead); and third, because it underestimates the possibilities of disagreement, adaptation and development which exist in all areas of the field. Homage to the achievement of established authors, expressed in the form of direct copying, is not an accepted mode of writing essays or dissertations in (for example) British universities and colleges. Therefore, it is important in your essay always to identify what is original and what is not. This is not just a matter of showing that you are not stealing or plagiarising other people's work. At least as important is the process of making explicit the argument structure of your essay. By acknowledging sources, you show the foundations for the speculations or conclusions you yourself are adding. If you simply insert other people's material unacknowledged into your own, another danger arises, too: that your writing becomes structurally incoherent (something we discuss further in Chapter 5, pp. 109–10). 1.8 PLANNING AN ESSAY: FORMAT AND PROPORTION In order to think ahead about your essay or dissertation you need to consider its overall length and the length of the parts which comprise it. This means making decisions very early on about the contents of the whole essay (e.g. by writing an initial synopsis). As in the case of the title, it is of course, possible — and sometimes necessary — to change the synopsis as you progress. You just need something to start you off that can then be modified as you go along. How much should you write? Below, we indicate some typical essay lengths. (You may find that your course, college or university has rules for upper and lower limits, so check these before you start.) Unless you are using a word-processor with a word-count facility, there is little point counting every word. An estimate is enough. Work out an average number of words per line and lines per page, and this will give you a typical number of words per page. Multiplying this by the number of pages is enough to show a rough total, which should tally adequately with tutors' estimates and impressions (since they won't count the individual words either). When you have noted the overall length you need to produce, divide this length into suitable proportions for your argument, so that not only will you not run out of space but the essay will have a ""balance"" as it develops, with worked-out proportions being given to each stage. This means deciding from the beginning a rough breakdown of the parts of your final essay: to achieve this, you should write an OUTLINE. Then you can assign half a page to an introductory paragraph, one page to the summary of what other people have said, etc. If you have a detailed outline of the structure and proportions, then if the essay becomes too long, you can work out more precisely where deletions need to be made: take out redundant or duplicated examples; cut lists shorter, reduce alternative words offered as glosses, etc. In this way you can shorten your essay without losing its balance or structure (which would happen if you just cut the end, for example). 1.9 GETTING STARTED: OUTLINES AND EARLY DRAFTS Speculating about your essay is one thing; actually starting to write it is another. If you look at your first blank page and freeze, how do you unfreeze yourself and get started? In this section we look at some ways of doing this, and more generally of getting from the planning stage to the writing stage. There is of course no single correct way; everyone writes differently. One productive starting point is to break the illusion that writing is a ""gestation"" process of waiting for inspiration until the essay forms itself, fully-fledged, in your mind and just needs to be written down. Even in exam situations, there needs to be some initial planning and rough drafting before starting on the main process of composition. But generally it is a good idea to start writing in some form as soon as you can. Be willing to do disposable work. Versions which you know you are going to throw away often allow you to experiment in ways that you wouldn't risk in a draft you consider ""final"" or ""near final"" . By thinking that everything is final — that it must pass your own ""quality control"" test — you greatly reduce the likelihood of producing any work at all. Remember that in the production of texts for non-examined purposes (e.g. committee reports, novels, paintings, films), rough versions, sketches and drafts are the norm. So there is no reason why you shouldn't do a rough-cut, followed by a fine-cut, before you start on your final version. This is not necessarily an increase in your workload: drafting and redrafting allows lower-intensity and less stressful work than packing everything into a single and decisive act of composition. It is also useful if someone is prepared to read your rough versions. This need not be your tutor; even someone who knows nothing about the subject can say whether you are making sense. Break down the process of constructing an essay into easy small steps. Make notes, draft paragraphs, keep rewriting short outlines. Each step you take provides scaffolding which will enable you to build the essay a little further. You note your arguments on a piece of paper; they look wrong, so you edit the notes, making them clearer or more coherent. The next day, as you come at the problems with a fresh eye (or at least from a slightly different angle), the notes look wrong again, but this time for slightly different reasons. So you do further editing. The text evolves, through successive steps of minor redrafting rather than through the more mysterious process of gestation, and with less chance of outside events or circumstances making you forget where you have got to. Make a timetable. Step-by-step writing allows you to do this, and commits you to making progress, even if later you discard what you have done. Bear in mind other commitments when outlining your programme of work (e.g. holidays, weekends, need for rest, etc.). Be realistic from the outset, so that you don't become dismayed by your inability to keep to your own timetable. As part of the process of writing from the very beginning, and writing in small steps, from the first day you should write down, and keep available, notes consisting of a few sentences on each of the following:(a) the essay's hypothesis (the claim it is interested in exploring);(b) the evidence or data you are going to use (the facts, quotes, parallel cases from other texts, etc., that you are in the process of collecting);(c) brief statements of your ideas so far;(d) in the case of a longer dissertation, the preliminary results of a ""literature search"" (a survey of bibliographies to find things to read). The value of having such materials in brief and physically separate forms is that it is easier to manipulate ideas while they are still in note form than it is once you have written them out in prose. A note-form outline of the essay provides a clear conceptual structure, and offers you an overview, which — when inspected closely — should allow you to assess how coherent it is, and how clearly it moves to your conclusion. Sometimes, it can be useful to write each main point in the argument on a separate card or sheet of paper, and physically reorder them on a table in front of you, joining up the points in your mind with a linking commentary. (How do you get from this point to this? What is it that makes you want to put one point before another?) Before working on anything else write a one-paragraph SYNOPSIS (a summary of your essay's argument). Keep your synopsis handy all the time you are writing, and edit it periodically (because writing your argument down will probably change it). A useful test is to imagine that you are at a party and someone asks you what you are writing about: your answer will have to be short, coherent and sufficiently interesting to hold the attention of a listener who does not have to listen to you. The best answer you can give in these circumstances should provide the shape for your synopsis. Remember to focus. What is important is that your essay needs to be made up of logical or structural relations between points (e.g. cause and effect, consequence, incompatibility, counter-example), not just of a list. As we suggest in more detail in Chapters 2 and 3, you will be able to find materials more easily and see the best arrangement for them when you have formed a sense of what you are looking for. Most fields are too large to research convincingly, unless you go into them with at least a provisional focus. With a guiding aim, you tend to read with a goal or personal agenda; what you read falls into place, at least relative to a notion of what your interest in the field is, or what perspective you wish to adopt on it. Keep the idea of ""perspective"" in mind, since it indicates that for your purposes some materials and pieces of information will appear ""in the foreground"" ; others are only ""background"" , further away from your centre of interest. Clearly, you need to use the time you have available to consolidate what is going to be in the foreground — what is central to your essay — rather than in mugging up materials which at best can only ever form marginal elements of the final piece of work. Finally, consult essays already successfully submitted. Just as you can prepare for an exam by looking at old exam questions, so you can prepare to write a dissertation by looking at previous examples which have been  submitted and accepted by your institution. Studying these should ensure that you are not completely ignorant of the scope, length, format and demands of what you are trying to do. 1.10 SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF AS YOU CONSTRUCT AN ESSAY As you begin to write your outline or first sketch, make each of the two following types of plan: — a one-page plan describing what you are going to do and the order you intend to do it in (a PROCEDURAL PLAN);— a one-page plan outlining what your essay should look like when it is finished (a STRUCTURAL PLAN). If it seems easier, write your plans as simple diagrams, with different parts connected by arrows. It is important, though, to limit the size of the plans (e.g., to less than a page each), so that you keep a simple overview. The structure of your project needs to be visible, almost at a glance. To decide what should go into these two plans, think your way carefully through the following general questions, which should either suggest fresh ideas to you or else persuade you that your proposed topic is unrealisable. What are the questions I want to answer? Try to formulate these as questions rather than just phrases describing an area of interest. example If you start from an area of interest which is ""Irony in Jane Austen's novel Emma"" , try to work out some questions to ask, such as, ""Do any of the characters in Emma deliberately use irony?"" ;  ""Which characters use irony, and which don't?"" ;  ""Is there a distinction between the way men use irony and women use irony in Emma?"" , etc. What is the main or central question that I wish to address? A collection of questions will not necessarily give you a coherent focus for your essay, so you need to encapsulate as many as you can in a single basic question. example Which types of characters in Emma use irony and why? What kinds of answers am I looking for? Make as full a list as possible of what kinds of answer would be possible (to your main question and also to your other questions), so that you can at least consider candidates that your essay may then reject. example The question ""Which types of character in Emma use irony and why?"" is actually two questions. Answering the first part involves classifying characters into types, so it is useful to think of all types which might be relevant in answering the question — male versus female, old versus young, poor versus rich, and as many more as you can think of. Some of these may immediately appear irrelevant, but it is necessary to consider them briefly, if only to rule them out. Answering the second part, ""why?"" depends on the answer to the first part. But it is useful anyway to speculate about possible findings and so some possible explanations; the characters who use irony might be similar in type to Austen herself (in class, gender, age); or they might be the characters who function as heroes and heroines in the novels. Each of these answers raises further questions. This is exactly how you can build your essay, as a sequence of questions and answers. What methods will help me find answers? Your essay needs to provide evidence or reasons for your point of view. All the time you ought to be asking yourself: ""why should anyone believe what I am writing?"" and ""what have I noticed in the text or in background, contextual materials that makes me think this?""  Even if your reasoning is self-evident to you, it won't be to other people, who will come at the issue from a slightly (or very) different point of view. example How can you show your reader that you have made an exhaustive survey of the characters in Emma and whether they use irony or not? Drawing up a list of all speaking characters is an obvious start, with a note of pages on which they speak, and to whom. Putting all this into a diagrammatic table might be a good way to gather data so that you can see clearly if there are generalisations. You can put the table into your essay, if the information turns out to be significant. What books or articles do I already know that address my main question? Draw up a list, look on the library shelves, and once you have the books in your hands, consult the index and bibliography of each for further ideas. How can I draw boundaries round, or limit the scope of my chosen field? Bear in mind that background material expands infinitely, and needs to be closed off somewhere to prevent you becoming submerged in an endless and unfinishable project. Take note, in examinations, of how boundaries are suggested in questions, such as ""with reference to at least two works"" , or ""with reference to works by at least two authors"" . With larger projects, take care not to include everything you are interested in, just to bring it in somewhere. example Avoid the ""Jane Austen, gender, class, early nineteenth-century society and the development of the novel"" type of project, which inevitably lacks a clear focus. What is the relationship between my central question and current work in this subject area? It is possible that the question you are asking is different from the sorts of discussion you have encountered in what you have read on the subject. If so, indicate that you recognise this, if possible with an explanation of how. Or it may be that the question you are interested in has been discussed before, but that you want to develop it in a particular way, or to extend it, or to disagree with one of its premises. Again, indicate this, as precisely as possible. Establishing how your work fits into debate in the area is an important function of essay-writing in literary studies; generally speaking, you need to know why and how your work matters. example For the Emma essay, you could look in a bibliography for a link between ""irony"" and ""Austen"" and ""characterisation"" ; you could scan some collections of essays on Austen or Emma for possibly relevant material; similarly you could look in books on irony, in order to see how closely your ideas resemble existing material, and what aspects are original. Am I sufficiently interested in my question or topic to keep me interested over the necessary time period? With examination questions you have little choice. But you also have only a little time. Some pieces of work, on the other hand, require a lot of reading and study time during composition; and for these you are likely to produce better work if you choose questions that genuinely interest you, or connect with problems you are in any case interested in outside your literary work, rather than if you feel your work is being done out of obligation or under duress. Be wary, though, of topics involving issues in  which you are personally very deeply immersed. If you feel it will be difficult to stand back sufficiently to carry out the sorts of procedures we have discussed in this chapter, then it may be best to avoid them. example If you have a general political interest in social class, this could support an investigation of class as it relates to characters' use of irony in Emma. What kinds of benefits — personally and as a student — are likely to result from investigating my chosen topic? Evaluate what contribution the project can make to your grade or course requirement, and also what contribution it can make to your thinking or personal growth. 1.11 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter, we have suggested that how you present the evidence and arguments which make up your case about a problem or issue is at least as important in literary studies as the particular viewpoint you adopt, and counts as originality. Exam and essay questions come in a range of identifiable idioms, and there are established conventions for responding to them. Essays need to be constructed, not just written; so time spent on an initial outline establishing an essay's structure prevents problems of shape and proportion when the essay as a whole is written. Specific suggestions * If you are stuck for a topic, look at our description of the range of possible points of focus and modes of argument, and construct your essay by choosing and combining these established idioms (pp. 11–12). * Make sure you have a single basic question you are trying to answer (p. 13). * Learn the ""language"" of examination and set essay questions, so that you know how to ""speak"" suitable answers (pp. 15–17). * Break your essay into parts, in advance of writing it, and continuously update and revise your description of its structure. Decide what proportion of the essay each part requires (pp. 18, 22–4). * Start to write immediately; use writing as a way of working out what you want to say (pp. 22–4). * Show your reader clearly the structure of your essay or dissertation (pp. 13, 17). * Indicate clearly which aspects of your work are original and which are borrowed from already published material (pp. 20–1). See also pp. 25–8 for a checklist for getting started. Exercises (1) Select a novel you have just read. Using our description above (pp. 11–12), construct a brief summary of the main points which would make up an instance of each of the following TYPES of argument about the book: — stylistic mode (b)— contextual mode (d)— evaluation of conflicting critical arguments mode (f) Compare your three summaries. (2) Select any one of the exam questions we have presented in this chapter. Make a series of paragraph or section headings that you could use in a one-hour exam answer. (You do not need to know much about the topic to do this; you only need to be able to identify what you would need to know.) Bear in mind not only the length but also the proportion of your answer, so that each relevant issue in the question is addressed. (3) Invent a title in two parts (as in section 1.6), making sure that it indicates your attitude to the subject matter. Describe (in a short paragraph) the contents of an essay based around this title and briefly explain how the title captures the key idea(s) of the essay. (4) Invent a research topic (relate it to one of the subjects you are studying, if you wish), and write a list of specific questions you could ask about it, grouped as in section 1.10."

Oh according to Josie, I really don't know about all the cabbages, it might consist of one or two. Funny business, yeah. Oh it's a shame though isn't it? Mm. Mm. All the time you spend waiting for the blooming things to grow . That's Yvonne's mother isn't it? Yeah. That's right. Didn't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil? Oh I don't know. Mm. So I sh  yes. She's probably fallen out with some kid or other. You can't be sure of that. Oh no no no no no. If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road, then fair enough, but I couldn't er  go and vandalize something, I mean a thing like flowers. Mm. Mm. They're so nice that Well we think so. Obviously there's others that don't think so, but  not everybody thinks so. Well a lot of people like, I mean most people like flowers don't they? Yes. Whether you grow them or not's a difference  but most people  Yeah, yeah. Oh true, true. They're not an ug ugly thing. like them. Mm. And I couldn't go and vandalize something that was nice. No. No. There's some peculiar minds some people have don't they? Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it? Compared to some of the dodges they get up to. It is really. Mm. Have you decided whereabouts you're going to put that light at the front? Light? Er well no the, well at the front. Other than that, over the door area somewhere, I don't know exactly. I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit  and see where it's best. Mm. But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway. Mm. of course is cable running to it  providing it with power. I'll probably run it from the garage . Mm. About the easiest source. On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea, do you think? Between the garage and the house. Do you mean the return? If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage, that little bit there? There's two feet or something . No. I thought you were going to put it facing the front. I am, yes. Well what do you mean then, the corner? On the co on the front of the house at the corner. Yes , you mean literally on the corner? The apex of two Yes. Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but  Well I know that. Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make something to mount it on. No. No. No. No. Why? It'll screw drive  on to a flat surface. Brickwork. Yeah. Certainly it will. Yeah. Mm. How high up are you thinking of putting it? Above a vandal . How high  . How high is the one we've got at the back? Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it. Er up a step ladder I mean, not a  I think about, above the number. I'd thought roughly speaking in that area, yes but Er yes, well somewhere there. Ah well that would illuminate the er  see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side, going down towards the garage. Close to that corner, still lighting on the front face but Mm. then a percentage of light will go round the corner. Well  cos lights don't go round corners but  What about on the garage above what about on the garage? No. No? No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't it? Mm. Mm. Well above the number then. Cos you're nearly, you know, more or less on the corner there anyway aren't you? Mm like I say that would be  mm. Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage. For feed, you know? Mm. Mm. Well that's the easiest bit,. To the  circuit, yeah. What's that then? That is . It will be helpful though, having a light there. Oh yes. Because at night, you get a percentage a a  Yes you do. degree of light I should say from that  street lighting, but not an awful lot. Not the same, no. Mm. No it is handy having the light. And for people coming in, going out for the step. Yeah. whatever, you know? Mm. It'll be a quite sufficient  spread to, to cope with the er  entrance to the garage I mean, you know? Mm. I still think two rows of erm pavers  stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know? To put there. There's only one problem  You mean to the garage? Well the approach to the garage, yeah. The drive. Like Mike's got at, in their   Er yes. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. The usual thing, yeah. Well you get a erm You get a what? You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are. No, not if you put sodium chlorate down. Nothing'll grow then. Good grief. The thing is if you  If you what? erm  I'm just thinking if, like when anybody comes to stay  Yeah. Yeah. and you run the car, or somebody runs the car  the other way Up the sides, yeah. Yeah? Well then you're going across, you're not staying st er you're not on the pavers are you? No, well that doesn't really matter. I mean the erm  in fact, there's only one fairly tight  path you can follow to get the car in. Into the side. If you think about it. Mm. It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in. Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd? Not necessarily, no. No. I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines . What, like I have down the garden there? A railway line in. No no. Actually it's quite attractive  A walk you know walk  that actually. Well it is but it   I was looking at it again this morning. Yeah. I thought that. Ooh  hark at her! Yes. Well I think some of the bricks could  when you decide wha which you're going to use and which you, mm. Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er I'll  get some of those bricks up and put the stone things down cos they look better. Mm. Mm. Mhm. As long as I can get, walk along and get to all the plants there. What do you think of that ? I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at the bottom. There we were the steps are. Oh lifting them you mean?you mean? Oh god . Yeah . That would make th give it a better erm  Yes. Yeah. I don't see any reason for that, to be quite honest, why they've done that? Well there was at the time obviously. Cos do you remember there was that erm  monstrous  creation I should say erection,erection  for erm  Oh I know that. Well there's still some of those stones at, underneath that . The foundation, exactly. I know, yeah. We've got to move those before we grow anything. I've put some of the bricks over one side, so that'll eliminate getting rid of one side of them. No, I'm not with you. Well where I've put me bricks  they're  Yes. on top of some of those  stones that are underneath. I'm with you now. It's fairly deep  eight inches down, the bricks? I know. I know I went quite a way down. You did. I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a ruddy house there wouldn't you? I wonder what they did it for? That's only er I don't know. It's the same with the  greenhouse  It was a right monstrosity that thing wasn't it? They'd have had a nine inch  thick erm  solid concrete  path in the centre. Who the hell  I know! wants that? In the middle of the co  Stupid. er of the greenhouse. Talking about stones, we'll have to have a trip up to the erm that er  yard to see if . You know when we went to see about the flagstones? Oh there? Yes, yes. I've not seen any  there's not been any more in erm  workmen in . It's a good idea that, going up there. Well   oh dear. I've kept  my eyes open  when we're going through Harford  No sign? and there's no signs of work. Mark you  it wasn't a brilliant day was it? So No it wasn't. Well we just have, must have just missed them. Yeah. Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. Cos those were definitely new ones, ready for  placing in. Mm. A, a pile of stones. Oh yeah. So the old ones they'd have taken back to that yard place wouldn't they? Well no. No no, no. What do they do with them? No, straight to the tip. Well that's the place that  That's not the tip. Where we went? Yeah. That's not the tip. Well which was the tip? You've never been to the tip. I don't think, no you've not. Oh. It's erm  Tearscross way. You know the quarry? Well  the quarry area anyway, the same road. Oh so I've never  You can approach it two ways. From erm  I thought it was there. They had a lot of stones there  No no no. didn't they? That's just bits they've had on various trucks. Lorries and things. Oh. No, no. Oh I see. No no. The tip is where I went. The first time I went  I followed the route recommended by Peter? Peter  which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos it's a winding Mm. country road  single track in a lot of directions. Do they just heave the bricks? They just heave them? They don't  Apparently yes. sell them off or anything? No. No they don't they just  they stick them on to  Mm. They'd serve our purpose very well there Mm. Mm. because there's such an awful lot to do. Mm. We could bring them right  well the two that are down there could come   Yeah. It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it? On indeed it would, yes. It would. Mm. Mm. I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year though. Pardon? I hope to give the mixer a caning this year. I hope  you do too . Yeah . Mm. wondering what to do next. Mm. Oh yes, yes. When you come to think of it though it's s to me it makes sense  to start at the top where we have done  and work your way down doesn't it? In some ways it is  sensible, yes because you're carrying muck down. Well of course you are. Yeah. I mean down, when we've done down here we've pu god  been putting mats down and lord knows what to Mm. oh yeah. Mm. But the erm  ceiling rose  and preferably the light switch  could do with replacing . Oh I know the ce oh the ceiling rose, they're horrible those old things, aren't they? Mm. Well the, the lighting switch isn't so clever either. No. And before  I put too much back I want to have the floorboards up to clear"

Flies it out Like kidneys  properly well it's true, that's what they're doing  just the while we're having our tea  But then, the usual  at Birmingham station  Yeah, what do you mean by happily being sarcastic? Yeah, very, mind you  Mind you, it's probably  it wasn't really their fault, there was a big  factory  in Banbury Mm and it upset erm, the first thing we  it weren't   Mum can I have another   train from, to Redditch and it was  Yeah and all the . We are very sorry the train at number eleven  platform eleven, when you get to Lemington on it, get out if you're going to Banbury, there will be a coach, because there's a fire at Banbury, well I thought it meant there was something on the other side of the railway, it was, a factory near there so, so then er they get you in   Are we meant to eat these before the cake, is that the idea? Or is that what everybody's doing? I'll wait, I'll tell you the story about the fire Yes, you carry on talking while we chomp they, they all sitting on, a few of us sitting on the seat, the girl that was all shaky she was going for an interview at a Birmingham University  another lady was going on to Northfield well you're alright , you'll be alright we said if you get on the train where we get on, you're OK, so they get, getting out  It's a place I really like What place?

I've got erm, we've had one through from erm  erm came round on Wednesday morning because we had Wednesday morning, one should be coming via the post today, we phoned up yesterday Oh yeah, yeah and he's sending it first post, it should be through today, if not tomorrow morning, erm Oh dear the other one gave us a quote for three hundred and eighty eight Oh that's not bad then which was good, but Gary's suspicious at that price Three hundred and eighty eight? Yeah What's that to do? comparing it , comparing it with erm one thousand, two hundred, he's, he says it's rather suspicious What is that for the actual three hund  Just, just the actual erm sliding mirror wardrobes Just the doors no fitting or anything? Yeah it's for the fittings and everything, erm and I've had prices like one thousand two hundred, eighteen hundred, and this bloke you know, says three hundred and eighty eight Oh  and Gary's rather suspicious at that price, we, we had a builder that came round he, he wanted four hundred and twenty Yes and that was with the doors from Texas and he thought oh no you know Yeah we'd rather get it done properly, erm, but erm, this  that came yesterday morning, he reckons it, that he can do the whole of the bedroom, look there's been an accident, I've got to tell you  Oh good they've gone right over that bank, right over that bank, right over there, it's bounced over  It's speeding I expect Yeah to get that far erm and they can do the wardrobes and the fitment erm and wardrobes either side erm for eighteen hundred Oh which is the price we were looking at, it's not too cheap and it's not too expensive Yeah cos Gary sort of said we should set prices that are too low Maybe they just, he just done it so cheap because of the recession I mean Yeah you can get almost anything done at the moment Yeah can't you? so we'll wait and see  Well was it all private people then  we'll see what price they give  or companies? No it's all companies What even this three hundred and eighty eight? Yeah, that's  Well you can always check it out Yeah make sure it is a genuine it, the, the, he's come from the company and he's not doing it privately or something You see the thing is, I said, Gary said to me he said did you ask them about the over bed erm units and that and I said yeah, I said he wanted to, he, he said he could do the over bed unit for eighteen hundred plus the wardrobes for three eighty eight Yeah well this  people I mean with, with, that I mean that really is more or less the same amount as the other companies have said for er more or less the whole lot, so why the wardrobes are so cheap and yet the, the bed surrounding is so expensive, we don't know Mm whereas  people they reckon that they can do it, they can do the whole lot for eighteen hundred  Yeah , oh strange isn't it? Yeah , it's er, it's er cheap for the wardrobes, but expensive for the over bed unit, I mean Gary said well at that price he said the over bed unit we might as well get out of a catalogue. Well, yeah, talking of catalogues actually you might know, my two want a beanbag right? Yeah They've got one in Argos but the colours are disgusting and it's twenty pound, you see I went and brought one for Boo Boo, that one from Argos  Yeah , yeah and they absconded it, and the dog hasn't a hope in hell and also the ones you get for the kids, when you sit in them they sit up like little chairs don't they? Yeah  whereas the dog's one  Yeah  lie down on  lie down on  and I haven't got them in my club book, any ideas? Erm, Argos, Index, or  Argos has only got the one which is disgusting  Is this for the dog? No this is for the kids, I've got the dog, I've got the dog's, but the dog ain't got it  Market, Saturday market Yeah they do, they do er a carpet stall and they also do erm on the same stall with a carpet, they do erm, duvets Mm pillows, and they do beanbags as well  Do they not do it on a Thursday? No, I've never seen them there on a Thursday No Saturday is the only time I've seen them there I just wondered cos Argos wanted twenty pound and nineteen ninety nine  Yeah, yeah I think they want twelve, twelve ninety nine or something off the market Yeah It's been ages since well, since I looked, but I'm sure it's something like that. Yeah, but I also got a leaflet for refills as well  Oh that's what I need some more of those for his beanbag Yeah that's what it's for the dog's bean bag Yeah so Yeah I've got the address at home if you want it Right  now, put a bit of lipstick on   Do you wanna grab my catalogue do you when we get back to my place? Why is there anything in there? Well you said you wanted to have a look at the er quilt covers? Oh no, I'm gonna leave that for a bit Are you? Yeah, due to lack of funds  Twenty P an hour innit? Oh, where's my bag then? I've got it here Oh god I thought I'd lost it for a minute  I though while I was there I might as well grab it erm Is it twenty P for an hour or thirty P? What's the time? Half past nine, half past ten Twenty five past nine I normally, let, well, if I put an hour and a half in cos if we're a bit late Yeah five or ten minutes late, it's cheaper for me to put ten P in than to pay twelve pound ticket Yeah actually it's twenty pound Yeah right, I'll just nip over and get it, cos I haven't locked up yet  maybe I won't I haven't got ten P, I've only got two pennies, just have to make sure back  You want ten P? Well just in case we're not As you came down town for my sake really   Alright then, I'll accept, I won't be a minute Yeah  "

I think it might need burning off because if you leave it on  it's gonna be a bit oddish! I don't know if I artex, artex wood? I don't know. No.. If I could artex the wood, it's a lot easier cos all you've gotta do is just scrape it and leave it. Scrape all the loose bits off. I don't know what that wood's, the wood's there for anyway! It's part of the stairs! Oh is it? Yeah. Part of the stairs. houses aren't they? Put up quick! Oh I'll have a toilet in there. There's no room in there.

DEM DEM-KE2-007 -0.08 "Which page? Eighty two. Found that quickly didn't you? Er  percentages is it? Yeah. Right. E one. Have you looked at this? Let's have a look at it. B's height is sixty percent of A side. There's B  and it's sixty percent of A  C's height  is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height. There's a hundred percent  so a hundred and twenty it means it's more  than A's height. If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height  it means it was exactly the same. If it's less than a hundred it's smaller  if it's more than a hundred  it's greater. Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty  is one point two  and there you've got nought and nought  a hundred and one  so ninety percent is point nine, eighty percent is point eight  and a hundred and ten percent is one point one, and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two. So what you're doing, in fact  is to  if you've got a hundred and twenty  percent  if you divide that by  of a hundred  in other words, you move your decimal point two places  that's a decimal. So a hundred and twenty percent  as a decimal fraction is one  point two. All you do  is to  move that decimal point two places. Alright? So  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply  by  one point two. If you wanted to calculate  eighty percent of an amount  you would multiply by point eight. A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two. So write down  decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent. That's right. Now calculate a hundred and forty percent  of seven point five  kilogrammes. Have you got a, you've got a calculator haven't you? Haven't got it with you? No. But you've got your own? Scientific one? No? No. You could do with one. Alright? It's one of those things that you could do with really. If you've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you  that's what you want! You want one of these scientific ones. So, you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five. Let's have a look. What is it? A hundred and forty percent, so it's one  point four  times  seven point five. Try it. Use that one. Yes you use your finger . One  point four times Oh it's . Ten point five, that's right. Okay. Ten point five killogrammes. Right! Put it on the, on the er  on that desk which probably will be better. So, alright calculate  a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds. That's right,a , what is that? Eighty seven point nine. Yeah, so it's eighty seven pounds  ten isn't it? That's right. Right, B  a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres? Oops! No . Start again. Right, one point two metres  times  thirty two. Yeah? What is it? Thirty eight point four. That's right! Now, a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres? One three three eight two. That's right. Right! E three A. What are the decimal equivalents of  a hundred and sixty percent? That's right. A hundred and sixty three percent? Six six four. Yeah, point six three. Good! You move that decimal point you see, in two places and it's one point three. A hundred and six percent? One point nought six. That's right! One point nought six. Again,yo you, the figure staying the same, all you do is to move a decimal point two places. So D is One point three nine . One point three nine. Alright. And E? One point nine . One point nine   or one point nine, yes. Right! A factory plans to increase it's output by fifty percent next year. So if this stands for this year's output  at a hundred percent  fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year's . So there's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent. So next year's output is  to be a hundred and fifty percent  of this year's . Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent  and a hundred plus fifty is  a hundred and fifty. So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O  or one point five. Next year's output is to be one point five times this year's. So you multiply this year's output  by one point five  and it'll give you next year's output. Alright? You add on that fifty percent  or whatever it happens to be  to the hundred percent  which gives you the new figure. You change that into a decimal  that is what you multiply by. So, let's have a look. If something is increased by fifty percent  it is multiplied by one point five. A new town plans to increase it's population by fifty percent during the next five years. If the present population is eighty three percent  calculate the planned population in five years time . So what are you gonna multiply that by? One point five. Right! So it's eighty three thousand  and what do you get? One two four five O O. That's right. One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred. Now, calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent ? Now, you can give the answer in this form  you needn't write it out in full. So, what you're gonna do is to multiply  sixty four point eight by Haven't got anything. one point five  and that'll give you an answer which you will write down  followed by the word million. Alright? So, sixty four point eight  multiplied by one point five Ninety seven point two. Right! Ninety seven point two. Good! Now this one. That's fifty eight point eight. A fifty eight point eight million. And C? Eighty nine point seven million. That's right! Okay. An airline  is to increase all it's fares by seventeen percent . Now this erm illustrates the increase. There's your hundred percent  it's got to go up by  one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent. One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven. So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen. The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven. Move two decimal  yo decimal points down those two places, alright? So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven. The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare. That represents a seventeen percent increase. So at three,before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds  calculate the new fare  after the increase . Six O three point five. Right! So that's six hundred and forty three pounds  fifty pence  Fifty. isn't it? Right! F four. If you want to increase something by forty five percent  what do you multiply it by? Four point five. One  if you're increasing it by forty five percent  if it was a hundred percent  and you increase it by forty five  hundred percent  Oh it'll be nought point No. A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what? A hundred and forty A hundred and  forty five. five percent. Right? Now what's that of a decimal equivalent? One point four five. Right! Alright? So, if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by? One point  erm  four five. Think in terms of putting a one in front of that  and then moving a decimal point two places and it's one point four five. So okay, F four A is  one point four five. Alright? That's the first, that's your answer to that first question. F four A  was one point four five. Now  it says  No! Just one point four five. Oh yeah. A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five, alright? So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent. So you're gonna multiply the twenty eight by? One point four five. Right! Forty point six. Forty pounds sixty, right. Right! Right! F five, now all of these  you've got to increase e something by something there so you've got to change each of those percentages  you've got to think of it as added to a hundred  and then the decimal equivalent. So what are you gonna multiply the sixty seven by? One point six two. One point six two. Right! Good! One O eight point five four. That's right, one O eight point five four  and it is in killogrammes. That's right. Right. Right! So F six  A. If you want to increase something by seven percent  what do you multiply it by? Er nought  point seven. Sorry? Say it again. Nought seven, one point nought seven. Yeah, one point nought seven, that's right! So  your ar answer to A is one point nought seven. Good! So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent. Sixty nine  point thirty five. Sixty nine pound thirty five pence. Right! Good! Okay, now F seven's gonna be the same. Increase ninety two pounds by three percent. That's right. Nine pound four seventy six. Good! Right. That's right. Good! Right! Alfred's salary  is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four  Alfred has a twenty two percent increase  and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase  who earns more after all this ? So what you've got to do is to put down Alfred's  Alfred  and put his new salary down  and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is  which is the most. So you're going to look for Oh, tell me again ! Alright. So  Oh . so right, eighty four two nought  multiplied by Erm eight  that's right. So what's that, ten  two seven two forty? Yeah. Put a, put the forty down cos it's forty pence. Right! Yep! That's good! Now, Alberta's. Right! So, earns more afterwards? Alfred. Right! So Alfred is the answer. Right! Oh, we're coming to negative numbers. Have we done negative numbers? No. No. Right. Positive, negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends  in both directions. You can do some simple calc calculations by thinking of a number line, for example, two, minus two, plus five  means start at minus two  then go up five  so you'll finish at  three. So minus two, plus five  equals Three. plus three . Right? Minus three, minus two means start at minus three  then go down minus two, so minus three and minus two is  minus five . Alright? Now, before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down. Here you've got, minus four and plus three. That's minus one. Good! Minus four and plus six? Two. Plus two, right. Yes, two, yeah okay. So write them down cos yo you obviously can do those alright. It's plus two minus  one   Minus one , yeah. Minus It's two. Yeah, two. Now two minus five? Minus three. Minus three. Minus one minus three? Minus four. Right! Minus six plus two. Minus four. Right. And three minus eight? Minus five. Right! The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number  plus three means go up three, minus three means go down three. But it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three  or seven minus, minus three, for example but it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three, or seven minus minus three  where you have to add or subtract a negative number. Adding a negative number. Think what happens if you start with four  and add on different numbers. Four plus three, as the number you add on goes down  so the answer goes down. Four plus three equals seven  four plus two equals six, four plus one five, four plus nothing equals four, four plus minus one  is three  cos you're coming down here, three two, one, nought, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five. So as the numbers that you add on get one less  so the answers get one less. So, four  plus minus one is three, four  plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nothing, four plus minus five is minus one. What is important  is that you realise that  that number  is minus one  that number is one  plus one if you like but you don't need to say it but if th any, if the sign isn't there it's assumed that it's plus. But that number and that number are two different numbers. They're as different as one is from three. That is a different number from that, that is a different number from that. And that number is minus one. Don't think of it as taking away one  thinking of it, think of it as  minus one, a number. That is minus two  that is minus three  that is minus four, that is minus five. You've done some algebra haven't you? Found out the value of X  well you can X  equals minus five. And that is a value for X, it equals minus five  and minus five is a number. So, try and remember that, that that is a number in it's own right. Now when you start thinking of what to do  you've got plus four and you've got minus three  if you take the smaller digit, now that digit is four, that digit is three  if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit, you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is. When you've got two numbers that are both, all pluses, four and two is six, four and one is five, four and nothing is four, four and minus one means you got  plus four minus one, is one less than four, it's three. You've got four plus numbers, you got two minus numbers  which leaves you with two plus numbers. Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up. Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page . Notice that four plus minus one  has the same answer as four minus one. Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus. So we've got four  plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nought, four plus minus five is minus one  what's going to be the next one? Four plus Minus six Equals? makes minus two. Right! So write that down in your book now safely. A is A two, write down the next two lines. So you got four plus minus six is minus two, then you'll have four plus  minus seven is gonna be? Minus three. Right! Okay? So  let's go on. Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N   adding the minus number  is the same as subtracting it. So copy and complete these . So write down A three A. Five plus minus three  equals five minus three  equals? Two. Two. Right! Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six  which is going to be? You got plus two minus six Four. Mm? Four. You take the smaller digit from the larger digit  so you take the two  Eight. from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger  so it's minus four. Alright? Now this is minus three plus minus four  which is the same as minus three minus four. Now you can, those are both the same sides so you're gonna en add them together  and give it the sign that is common to both. Minus six. Minus? Six? Three and four? Seven, sorry! So , alright? Minus seven, yeah? Happy? Right, so A four,work these out . Now if you can do them then just put the answer down. Six  plus minus three is the same as six  plus and a minus give you a minus, so it's the same as six minus three  which is? What's six minus three? Three. Three! Right! You take the smaller digit from the larger digit, so you take three from six gives you three  you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus. Now this time  you've got two  minus five. Yeah. You take the two, the smaller digit from the larger digit  but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit. So it's? Minus Minus three! Alright? Yeah? Okay, you got minus one  and a minus four. Minus four. No, you got a minus one  and a minus four  they're both the same signs, cos it's minus one, minus four  they're both the same signs  so you put them together  four and one make? Five? And you've got Minus one. minus , so they're minus five. Let's just have a look at  if we've got  six and four  we can have six plus four  or you can have six minus four  we can have minus six, minus four  or you can have minus six  plus four. Now  that's a plus six and a plus four  what's the answer? Ten. Ten. Nice and straightforward. Both the signs are the same. So you add them together and you give it the same sign. This one  what's the answer to that gonna be? You've got a minus six and a minus four. Both the same signs. Ten. Can't be the same as that. They're both minus. Those are both plus  so we call it plus ten  these are both minus so the answer is? Ten. Minus ten. Alright? If the signs are the same you add them together, you give the ssssa the sign that they're both the same as. Now, here you've got six minus four  now what's six minus four? Two. So that equals two. Now here you got minus six  plus four  take the smaller from the larger  and give it the sign of a larger. Minus two. Right! Does that help  a little bit? Let's do another one. Let's do erm  eight plus three  eight minus three  minus eight, minus three, and minus eight plus three. Let's see if we can do those. What's eight and three? Eleven. Right. What's minus eight and minus three? Minus nine. No! Minus eight and minus three? Both the same signs. Minus eleven. Minus eleven. Now this is easy, eight minus three is? Five. Five. But this is a minus eight  That's five, yes. plus three, it's minus five. Alright? Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you  all the four possibilities. Alright? When the signs are the same  if they're two pluses you add them and it's plus  if they're both minus you add them and it's minus  here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger. Three from eight is five, that's plus five. Three from eight is five, but that is minus, so it's gonna be minus five. Okay? So keep that by your side  and see how we get on. So we've what were we doing? A  B  D! This one here is it? Minus two plus minus five. Which is minus two  minus five. Minus two  plus the minus gives you a minus, so you got minus two, minus five. Er, minus seven. Minus seven. Right! Now here you've got nought  and a plus minus gives you a minus, so it's nought a minus four? Minus three. Right! Good! Three  minus three? Three Nought. minus three. Nought. Nought, right! Minus five  minus two? Minus three. Erm Minus and a minus. Same as that one, look. Minus two, minus five. You got that one right. What was that? Minus two and minus five. Seven. Is minus seven. Right? So here you got minus five, minus two which is? Minus seven. Minus seven. Now here you got seven  minus nine? Take the smaller from the larger which will give you? Seven  from two, nine is two  and that number is a minus so the answer's going to be a minus, so it's gonna be? Minus two. Minus two. Alright?"

FIC FIC-CDB-003 -0.19 "When he said he did not know the date of Adam's return, Lewis Verne-Smith had not lied to the police. It would have been very unusual for him to have known a fact like that about his son's life and movements. If not exactly estranged, they were not close. Lewis was inclined to say he had ‘no time for’ Adam. He believed his son disliked him and this he thought outrageous. Sometimes he thought about Adam when he was a  child and what a dear little boy he had been, affectionate and not troublesome. ‘They undergo a complete change when they grow up,’ he said to Beryl. ‘Adam, for instance, he might not be the same person.’ He had decided to find out when Adam was coming back and drive to Heathrow and meet the plane. Adam lived as far away from the parental home as was possible while still living in north London. Without saying anything to his wife Lewis drove to Muswell Hill and checked that Adam's car was in its garage. It was. This meant they must have had a hired car to take them to the airport or have gone by tube. Adam's own car was bigger and newer than Lewis's and very clean and well polished, all of which Lewis disliked. An obscure feeling that he ought to have a key to this house made him resentful. It was something he found hard to understand, though of course it must be accepted, this escape of children from the parental bonds so that they could have secrets from you and hiding places you couldn't penetrate, that they were adults and possessed houses and cars which you had no hand in choosing or buying, that they could lock up those houses as they locked up their thoughts. He made his way round the side of the house, peering in at the windows, noting that some dishes, though washed, had been left on the draining board. There were dead flowers in a vase half-full of green water. Lewis held simultaneously two opposing views of his son, one that he was a feckless, idle, good-for-nothing layabout and the other that he was a hard, ruthless, astute and already well off businessman. When the former view of Adam predominated Lewis felt easier, happier, more justified. On the way it had occurred to him that he might find the police at Adam's. It would not have surprised him as he walked clockwise round the house to have met a policeman proceeding widdershins. However, there was no one about, not even the neighbours. Lewis stood on the front lawn, looking up at the bedroom windows. It was a very nice house, bigger than Lewis's own and in a more attractive neighbourhood, a neo-Georgian, double-fronted, detached house, altogether superior to the kind of thing most married men of twenty-nine could afford to live in. Adam could afford it because of the money he got from the sale of Wyvis Hall and later from the sale of the London house he bought with the money from the sale of Wyvis Hall. If things had happened differently he, Lewis, would be living in a house like this or in a flat in central London with a cottage in the country as well. And Adam would have what was proper for someone of his age and standing in the world, a terraced cottage in North Finchley or maybe Crouch End, the first rung on the slow ladder of upward mobility. Lewis thought bitterly that as it was, the only possible next step up for Adam would be Highgate village… He drove home and this time he felt able to phone the travel agent friend of Adam's without fear of a rebuff. And the man was very pleasant, reminding him that they had met at Adam's wedding. He had no objection to telling him when Adam and Anne were returning: next Tuesday on the Iberian Airlines flight from Tenerife that got in at 1.30 p.m. After he had rung off Lewis considered informing the police, he thought this might be his duty, but on the other hand he did not want the police actually to be there when Adam arrived. He told his wife (and himself) that he was going to meet Adam in order to break the news gently to him that these awful discoveries had been made at Wyvis Hall and that foul play might have taken place while he, Adam, was actually its owner. ‘Aren't you getting things out of proportion?’ said Beryl. ‘How so?’ ‘There hasn't been anything said about foul play yet.’ But even as she said this, as Lewis, rather dramatically, told her, the Standard was on the streets announcing that police were treating the case as murder. It was only a few lines, it was tucked away, all very low key, but the word murder was there to be seen and read. As he set off for the airport Lewis remembered that he had told Adam from the first that only trouble could come from a person of his youth and inexperience inheriting a big house and land of the dimensions of Wyvis Hall. And he was right, for trouble had come, if rather tardily. Ten years it had taken, more than ten years. In some ways it seemed longer than that to Lewis and in others only yesterday. On the other hand, he could not remember a time when it had not been taken for granted the Hall would one day be his own. The Verne-Smiths were minor gentry. Lewis's grandfather had been I parson in a Suffolk village, with nothing but his stipend to live on, the father of seven children. Two of them had died young, one of Lewis's aunts had married and gone to America, the other two had remained spinsters, living as many unmarried women in the country used to do, in tiny cottages in the middle of a village, busy in a mouse-like way about parochial matters, having no youth, earning nothing, buried alive. The remaining brothers, his father and his Uncle Hilbert, were much younger. His father also took holy orders while Hilbert, practising as a solicitor in Ipswich, took care of himself by marrying a rich woman. The Berelands were wealthy landowners. If a son or daughter married and no suitable home was in the offing, a house would be made available. Lilian Bereland brought Wyvis Hall with her, not as a grace and favour dwelling to revert to her family on her or her husband's death but hers to do with absolutely as she liked. Of course, in her father's estimation, it was not much of a house, a warren of smallish rooms was how he saw it, and set in a damp situation on the side of a river valley. There was not much sale for that kind of thing at the time of Hilbert's marriage. The parson and his wife and children used to go there for their holidays. Lewis's father's parish was on the outskirts of Manchester and the vicarage was Victorian-Byzantine-Gothic, soot-blackened yellow bricks with the pseudo-Romanesque windows picked out in red bricks. Black-leaved ilexes grew in the churchyard and a brassy laburnum had flowers on it for one  week out of the year. Wyvis Hall was the most beautiful place the seven-year-old Lewis had ever seen and the countryside was glorious. In those days the fields were still small and surrounded by hedges and the lanes ran deep between lush banks. Wild orchids grew in the fens and monk's-hood and hemp agrimony on the borders of the little streams where there were caddis-flies and water-boatmen and dragon-flies in gold velvet or silver armour. Clouded Yellow butterflies abounded and Small Coppers and Blues and once the little boy saw a Purple Emperor. A pair of spotted woodpeckers nested in what was known as the Little Wood below the lake and when the nuts were ripe on the copper cob trees a nuthatch came up quite close to the house. That house! How differently did it appear to him from the Berelands' assessment! To him it was grand and spacious. In the drawing room a pair of pink marble pillars supported the embrasure of the windows. The staircase curved up prettily to a gallery. There was a library that Uncle Hilbert used as his study and, even more awe-inspiring, a gun-room with.stuffed animals and shot-guns on the walls. But the interior meant less — though it was not always to be so — than the grounds, the lake, the woods. The place took on a magical quality for Lewis, who had towards it something of that feeling of the Grand Meaulnes for his lost domain. He used to long for his holidays and grow deeply depressed when they drew to an end. It was a glorious victory when he managed to persuade the grown-ups to let him stay on after his parents had gone back to Manchester. Aunt Lilian had never had any children, and she died in 1960 when she was only fifty-five. Uncle Hilbert took the loss of his wife very hard and the only company he seemed to want was Lewis's. It was about this time that he started telling Lewis Wyvis Hall would be his one day. He also informed Lewis's parents, who got into the habit of saying things like, ‘when all this is yours’, and ‘when you come into your property’. Uncle Hilbert, however, was only just sixty, very hale and hearty, still very much in practice as a solicitor, and Lewis could not imagine stepping into his shoes, nor did he in those days think it very nice to anticipate such things. But he went down to Suffolk very often, much more often perhaps than he would have done had Wyvis Hall been destined to pass back to the Berelands or on to one of those cousins in the United States. His feeling for the place underwent many changes. In the nature of things meadow, grove and stream no longer appeared to him apparelled in celestial light, the glory and the freshness of a dream. He was growing up. He began to see the grounds as a possession , the gardens as something to impress others, the orchard and walled fruit-garden as places that would produce delicious food. Although he intended to live in the house, for at least part of the time, he saw it too as saleable and the value or price of it (however you liked to put it) going up every year. The pines in the wood, where Uncle Hilbert's hunt-terrier Blaze was the last creature laid to rest, he saw as a useful and lucrative crop. He noticed the pieces with which Wyvis Hall was furnished, taking books out of the public library on antiques and porcelain and measuring the remembered articles against illustrations, catching his breath sometimes at mounting values. Another thing he did was picture himself and his wife in the drawing room receiving dinner guests. The address on his writing paper would simply be: Wyvis Hall, Nunes-by-Ipswich, Suffolk. It was one of Lewis's ambitions to have an address in which the name of the street might be left out without causing inconvenience to the post office. The house and grounds were marked on the Ordnance Survey map for that part of Suffolk and Lewis, when he was feeling low, would get it out and look at it to cheer himself up. By the 1960s he was married and had two children, a son and a daughter. When his son was born he thought it would be nice, a nice gesture, to name him after Hilbert. ‘An old family name,’ he told his wife, though this was not true at all, his uncle's being thus christened having been an isolated instance of the use of Hilbert. There had been a fashion in the late nineteenth century for Germanic names and his uncle, born in 1902, had caught the tail end of it. ‘I don't like that at all,’ his wife had said. ‘People will think it's really Gilbert or Albert. I don't want him teased, poor baby.’ ‘He will be called by his surname at his public school,’ said Lewis, who though poor had grand ideas, as befitted the future owner of Wyvis Hall and its acres. So he won, or appeared to win, that battle and the child was christened Hilbert John Adam. Lewis had written to Uncle Hilbert and told him of his intention to name his son after him, inviting him to be the child's godfather. Declining on the grounds that he no longer had any religious faith, Uncle Hilbert sent a silver christening mug, large enough to hold a pint of beer. But the note that accompanied it made no mention of the choice of name and it was rather a cold note. Later on, when Lewis and his wife and the baby went to stay at Wyvis Hall, Hilbert's only comment on his great-nephew's name was: ‘Poor little devil.’ By then, anyway, the baby was always called Adam by everyone. Lewis, who was no fool, soon saw that in some incomprehensible way he had put his uncle's back up. He set about rectifying matters, attempting to redress the balance. His uncle's birthday was noted, he must always have a Christmas present bought and sent in good time. He was invited to London and all sorts of treats were held out to him as to how he would be entertained on such a visit, trips to the theatre and concerts, a specially organized tour of ‘Swinging London’, Carnaby Street, the King's Road and so on. Lewis knew very well he should not do this, that he was sucking up to someone for the sake of inheriting his property. But he could not help himself, he could not do otherwise. Of course he continued to take his family to Wyvis Hall regularly for their summer holidays. He had a daughter as well now whom he had been tempted to call Lilian but had seen the unwisdom of this in time and named her Bridget. His wife would have liked to go to Cornwall sometimes or even to  Majorca but Lewis said it was out of the question, they couldn't afford it. Perhaps what he really meant was that they couldn't afford not to go to Nunes. By 1970 you couldn't buy a derelict cottage in the Nunes neighbourhood for less than, 4,000 and Wyvis Hall would fetch five times that. One day, soon after he had retired from his legal practice, Hilbert told Lewis he had made a will that was ‘very much to your advantage’. He smiled in a benevolent sort of way when he said this. They were sitting out on the terrace on the low wall of which stood, in pairs, stone figures from classical mythology of a rather embarrassing kind. Under the drawing-room window agapanthus africanus , the blue lily, was in full flower. Hilbert and Lewis and Beryl sat in old-fashioned deck chairs with striped canvas seats. Hilbert leant towards Lewis when he told him about the will and gave him a pat on the knee. Lewis said something about being very grateful. ‘I finally made up my mind when you named the boy after me,’ said Hilbert. Lewis said more grateful things and about naming his son Hilbert being only proper and suitable under the circumstances. ‘In the circumstances,’ said Hilbert. He was in the habit of correcting minor errors of grammar or usage. Adam must have got it from him, Lewis sometimes thought, or perhaps (he much later and very bitterly thought) a similar pedantry in Adam was among the things Hilbert liked about him. Lewis did not like being corrected but he had to take it, and with a smile. It wouldn't go on for ever. The Verne-Smiths were not long livers. Lewis's father had died at sixty and his grandfather at sixty-two. His three aunts were all dead at under seventy. Hilbert would be seventy the following year and Lewis said to his wife that his uncle was beginning to look very frail. He began ‘running down’ to Suffolk at weekends on his own, and that Christmas he had his wife accompany him for four days, taking all the Christmas food with them. The woman who came in to clean and the old boy who saw to the garden had been instructed to call him ‘Mr’ Lewis and he felt very  much the heir. His uncle hadn't much money, he supposed, but there would be a little, enough to put central heating in, say, and have the place redecorated. Lewis hadn't made up his mind whether to sell Wyvis Hall after he had smartened it up a bit and with the proceeds buy a bigger and better London house and a country cottage or to keep the Hall and sell off some of the land for agriculture. According to his estimate, the result of perusing estate agents' windows in Ipswich and Sudbury, Wyvis Hall by the end of 1972 was worth about £23,000. It was a continual source of irritation to Lewis that Adam did not show more respect and deference to Hilbert. The boy was offhand and always trying to be clever. He called his great-uncle by his christian name with no prefix and did not jump to his feet when the old man entered the room. Lewis pressed Adam to accompany him on those solicitous weekend visits but Adam nearly always said he was too busy or would be bored. There had in fact only been one occasion during those last years that Lewis could remember and he was sure Adam had only gone because there had been a promise of some shooting. The visit had been far from successful, for Adam had sulked when offered the four-ten, the so-called ‘lady's gun’. Sometimes, since then, Lewis had wondered what would have happened if Adam had obeyed him and been kind and polite to the perverse old man. Would Hilbert have left his property to Bridget perhaps, or even to the Law Society? It was to be three more years before his uncle died, thus becoming the longest-lived Verne-Smith that anyone had heard of. The daily woman found him dead one morning in the April of 1976. He was lying on the floor outside his bedroom at the top of the back stairs. The cause of death was a cerebral haemorrhage. Adam was nineteen and in his first year at university, though at that time at home for the Easter break. After the cremation, while the few mourners were looking gloomily at the flowers, his uncle's solicitor, a partner in the Ipswich practice, spoke to Lewis simply to say that he believed he already knew the contents of the will. Secure as he thought in possession, Lewis brushed this aside as being an unsuitable subject for discussion  at such a time. The solicitor nodded and went on his way. A week later Adam got a letter saying he was the sole beneficiary under the will of his late great-uncle. There was no money, Hilbert having used all he possessed to purchase himself an annuity, but Wyvis Hall and its contents were Adam's absolutely. There were traffic jams all along the North Circular Road, a particularly long one at Stonebridge Park and another at Hanger Lane. Lewis, sensibly, had allowed himself a lot of time. Adam would be very surprised to see him. He would probably think something had happened to his mother and that Lewis was there as the bearer of bad news. Of course in a way he was, though not of that kind. For a moment or two, as he waited in the queue behind a container-truck full of German furniture and a self-drive hire removal van, Lewis returned to speculating as to how and why those bones had got into the animal cemetery. Frankly, he did not suppose Adam had had anything directly to do with this at all. What seemed likely to him was that Adam had allowed some undesirable person or persons access to the place and it was these vagrants or hippies — there had been a lot of hippies still about then — were responsible. Adam himself had never shown any interest in Wyvis Hall, as far as he had noticed. That was part of the unfairness of it. He had seen this unlooked-for inheritance simply as a source of lucre. When the letter came Lewis had nearly opened it himself. The postmark and the old-fashioned and precise direction (Esquire and the name of the house as well as the street number) told him it was from Hilbert's old firm. And he thought he knew what had happened. They had made a mistake, that was all, and sent it to his son. Or else it might be that Hilbert had left Adam some small memento or keepsake… Adam was lying late in bed. Lewis would never forget that if he forgot all the rest. And he, for his part, was feeling so euphoric that instead of shouting to his son to get up and stir his stumps, he had actually gone in there and put the envelope on  Adam's bedside table. The awful thing was that all this time Lewis had never had any doubts he was himself the new owner of Wyvis Hall. It must have been a Saturday or else Lewis for some reason or other was on holiday from work. Anyway he was at home that day, home for lunch, and he and Beryl were actually sitting at the table, talking as it happened about going down soon to take a look at the Hall, when Adam came in. He had very long hair at the time and a beard, Lewis remembered, and looked as they all did like some kind of weird prophet. To this day Lewis had a picture in his mind of how his son had looked walking into the dining room (or dining area of the living room really) wearing jeans of course, jeans with ragged hems, and a collarless tunic garment, tie-dyed with coloured inks. Afterwards Lewis wished he had said something scathing, alluding perhaps to the lateness of the hour or Adam's appearance. Well, he had alluded to Adam's appearance but in a genial way. He had been feeling cheerful, God help him! ‘Just in time for the locusts and honey!’. Adam said, ‘Something rather fantastic; old Hilbert's left me his house.’ ‘Yes, very funny,’ Lewis had said. ‘What has he left you? His desk? You always said you liked that.’ ‘No kidding, he's left me his house. Whatsitsname Hall. Unbelievable, isn't it? It was quite a shock. You can see the letter if you like.’ Lewis snatched the letter. He had begun to tremble. There it was in black and white: ‘…the property known as Wyvis Hall at Nunes in the county of Suffolk, the lands pertaining thereto…’ but it must be a mistake. ‘They've mistaken you for me, my boy,’ Lewis said grimly. Adam smiled. ‘I doubt that.’ ‘You doubt it? You know nothing about it. Of course Wyvis Hall is mine, it's always been a matter of fact it would be mine. This is a simple mix-up, a confusion of names, though I must say it amounts to criminal carelessness.’ ‘You could phone them,’ said Beryl. ‘I shall. I shall phone them immediately I've finished my lunch.’ But he was not able to finish his lunch. He couldn't eat another mouthful. Adam ate. He ate his way through bread and butter and ham and pickles and drank a half-pint of milk. Lewis went out into the hall and phoned Hilbert's solicitors. The one he wanted was still out at lunch. Adam got up from the table and said he thought he might go over to Rufus's. ‘You're not going anywhere,’ said Lewis. ‘I forbid you to leave this house.’ ‘You what?’ said Adam, looking at him and grinning. Beryl said, ‘Just wait a few minutes, Adam, till we've got this cleared up.’ ‘Why's he getting his knickers in a twist anyway if he's so sure it's a mistake?’ It was not then but ten minutes afterwards, when he had spoken to the solicitor and been assured there was no mistake, that Lewis began to dislike his son. Adam said: ‘You can't expect me to be sorry he left the place to me and not to you. Obviously, I think he made the right decision.’ ‘Can't you see what an outrage it is?’ Adam was excited. He wanted to go and tell the Fletcher family his good fortune. Lewis was boiling with rage and misery and shock. ‘Can I have the car?’ said Adam. ‘No, you can't! Now or at any other time, and that's final!’ Lewis soon formulated a plan whereby they could all share Wyvis Hall. It was not ideal, it was not what he had anticipated, far from it, but it was better than abandoning it to Adam. After all, Adam would be back at college in a week's time, the will would have to be proved, but by the middle of the summer why shouldn't he and his wife and Bridget use the Hall regularly at weekends? Adam could have it for his long vacation. He, Lewis, was quite prepared to get the place redecorated at his own expense. It was a family house after all, no doubt Hilbert  had intended Adam to share it with the rest of the family. He and Beryl and Bridget could go there at the weekends and they could all be there together for Christmas. What did a boy still at university, with no prospects yet of any sort of career, what did someone like that want with a massive country house? ‘I want to sell it,’ Adam said. ‘I want the money.’ ‘Sell the land,’ said Lewis. ‘I don't want to sell the land. It wouldn't fetch much anyway, agricultural land. And who's going to want to buy it?’ It was plain that Adam had gone into this aspect of things. ‘No, since you ask… ’ Clearly, Adam was only reluctantly willing to share his plans with his parents, ‘Since you ask, I'm going to go down and take a look at it as soon as I can and then I'm going to put it on the market.’ Adam returned to college. That summer Lewis thought perhaps he was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. He made all sorts of wild plans. He would go down to Nunes and take over the house. If necessary he would break in and take possession. The village people would support his cause — didn't they call him Mr Lewis? Wasn't he the rightful heir? Adam would never try to regain the house by force. By this time his fantasies took on the air of medieval barons' wars. He actually dreamed of himself in a suit of armour opening the big, oak front door with a mace in his hand and Adam riding up on a black, colourfully caparisoned horse. More practically, he consulted solicitors of his own in an attempt to have the will disputed. They advised him against trying. He had another go at persuasion and wrote Adam long letters to his college begging for compromises. Adam phoned home and asked his mother to stop his father bothering him when he was in the middle of exams. Lewis's doctor put him on tranquillizers and advised him to go away on holiday. In the middle of June he suddenly gave up. He washed his hands of Adam and Wyvis Hall and the memory of his Uncle Hilbert. The whole thing disgusted him, he told Beryl, it was beneath his notice, only he couldn't help feeling utterly disillusioned with human nature. He wouldn't go to Wyvis Hall  now if Adam invited him, if he went down on his bended knees. His exams over, Adam came home. He slept one night at home and then went down to Nunes, taking Rufus Fletcher with him. Or, rather, being taken by Rufus in whose van they went. Lewis refused to show any interest. He practically ignored Adam for whom he now felt a deep, distasteful antipathy. A few months before, if anyone had told him you could feel dislike for your own child, a real aversion from your own flesh and blood, he would not have believed them. But that was how he felt. He couldn't get Adam out of the house fast enough. Two days later he was back. So much for Wyvis Hall. That was how much Adam appreciated the beautiful old house he had had the unheard-of good fortune to inherit at the age of nineteen. He was going to Greece with Rufus Fletcher and Rufus Fletcher's girlfriend who was an Honourable, the daughter of some titled person. ‘You would think someone with her background would know better,’ said Lewis. ‘Know better than what?’ said Adam. ‘Well, a single girl staying in places with a man like that.’ Adam laughed. ‘How long will you be away?’ said Beryl. ‘I don't know.’ They never did know or if they did they weren't saying. Beryl might have saved her breath. ‘Term starts on October 17th.’ ‘You're never going to be in Greece for four months!’ ‘I don't know. I might be. Greece is quite big.’ ‘Staying in tents, I suppose. Sleeping on beaches.’ Lewis had forgotten to be indifferent and aloof, he couldn't help it. ‘And what about that beautiful old house you've been unaccountably made responsible for? What about that? Is that to be allowed to go to rack and ruin?’ ‘It's not in ruins,’ said Adam, looking him in the eye. ‘I don't know what rack means. I've got someone from the village coming in every day to check that no one tries making a nuisance  of themselves. Squatters, I mean. There's a lot of squatting going on.’ Lewis had known what he meant. He knew who Adam thought the squatters might be. It was a terrible way to speak to your own father. Up in the short-term car-park at Terminal Two, Lewis had to drive from floor to floor before he found a slot in which to put the car. He was back in the present now, having exhausted those resentful memories. Adam had gone to Greece the next day and not reappeared until September. Lewis and Beryl, of course, had never gone near Wyvis Hall, they would not have laid themselves open to such humiliation, to the possibility of their way being barred by some yokel, paid by Adam to keep an eye on the place. Where had Adam got the money to pay someone to look in at Wyvis Hall daily? Lewis asked himself this question as he went down in the lift and crossed the arrivals hall of Terminal Two to await the exodus from Customs. The flight from Tenerife was due in fifteen minutes and he saw that there was a screen on the wall that would show when it landed. People stood about meeting planes, men who seemed to be the drivers of hired cars carrying placards with the names of people or companies printed on them, families waiting for a returning father, a strange old woman in a red cloak, chewing gum. Lewis wondered what visitor from Rome or Amsterdam or the Canaries was going to have the misfortune to stay with her. Perhaps he should have told the police that there had been someone going into Wyvis Hall every day during those months of summer. Certainly it would not have been a respectable person, such as Hilbert's gardener or cleaner, but most likely some unemployed derelict Adam had met in a pub. This person might easily be the perpetrator of the crime that led to that appalling interment. And by association Adam would be involved in it too. There did not appear to be any police in the crowd. No policemen had been sent to intercept Adam, unless of course they were in plain clothes — those two that looked like  businessmen, for instance. They were probably detectives. Who else would be waiting at the arrival barrier at Heathrow at this hour? Lewis began to feel excited. Suppose Adam were to be arrested before he even reached his father? He imagined himself driving a tearful Anne and Abigail back to Beryl, then finding Adam a good lawyer. Adam would have to admit he had been in the wrong, had been extremely negligent, criminally careless really, in allowing any Tom, Dick and Harry access to Wyvis Hall. He might not wish to reveal names to the police but he would have to. Pressure would be put on him. Eventually, he would come to confess that if his father had inherited the Hall as he had rightfully expected to do, none of this would have happened. The arrival of flight IB 640 from Tenerife came up on the screen. By this time Lewis was off into a fantasy in which a girl Adam had got pregnant had been abandoned by him with their child at Wyvis Hall where she had later been murdered by a sinister caretaker. The first arrivals were coming out of Customs now: two middle-aged couples, a crowd of kids who looked like students, a family with four children and grandma, a man who looked as if he had been drinking on the plane, his collar undone and his tie hanging. The detectives who were not detectives after all stepped forward to meet him, one of them shaking hands, the other slapping him on the back. A woman came out wheeling a big tartan case and behind her was Adam, pushing cases on a trolley, Anne beside him looking brown and tired, pushing the empty pushchair, with Abigail asleep on her shoulder. Adam's face, when he saw his father, was a study in some unpleasant emotion, not so much anxiety as exasperation."
FIC FIC-FAJ-005 -0.14 "SIXTEEN The club is very quiet. There is a period of what seems to be enforced idleness in the afternoon. It reminds me of provincial France, where you can drive through a village on a summer's afternoon and wonder if the place is inhabited. No tennis ball thwacking. No lawn mowing. No clatter from the kitchen. Only the drugged flies lumbering and buzzing through the air and the idiot, eager frogs bellowing recognize no siesta. I pull back the candlewick bedspread and lie on my back with my manuscript. The laibon kicks off with a creation myth. The first man, Kintu, visited the sky where God, Ngai, lives and was given God's go-ahead to create the Masai people. (I had been led to believe that God lived in Ol Doinyo Lengai. Perhaps he claims the airspace above as well.) From Kintu sprang all the Masai, whose life was to be a great odyssey. The Masai were expressly charged by God with responsibility for the world's cattle. Cattle, says the laibon, must be praised. Every Masai thinks constantly about cattle. Every Masai sings hymns to cattle. The world is framed in the image of cattle. (My words, not his.) This is the Masai's special task on earth. There is no contradiction — as Claudia pointed out in her thesis — between this task and the fact that other tribes have cattle: other tribes have stolen them. They are not entitled to them. These other tribes were ordained by Ngai to be farmers, wretched people obliged to scratch the soil, just as the Ndorrobo were specifically entrusted by Ngai to produce what the Masai need — spears, shields and useful vessels. The Ndorrobo were not allowed to own cattle so they had to hunt the unappetizing wild game, something a Masai would never do. Many white people, says the laibon, did not understand  God's commandments and tried to change things. (You don't need to be a trained anthropologist to spot the seeds of conflict in this theology.) And now the fat bellies in the cities are carrying on where the white folk left off. (I can picture the laibon as he told me this, his son sitting behind him on a rock flossing his teeth.) The Masai moved from the great river of the north, freely interpreted as the Nile, says the professor in a note, down towards their present location. It was a terrible journey reducing the Masai nation to a few hundred survivors. (Our own time provides the television simulacra of this march in Somalia and Ethiopia.) The march took many years, perhaps more than a century. Time in those days lacked urgency or precision. But the plains, savannahs, rivers and hills, all the way from Samburu down to the Masai Steppe, proved fruitful and the Masai built up their strength through the acquisition of women and cattle so successfully that they chased out the other tribes who were obliged to cling to the mountains or secrete themselves in the forests, land useless for cattle. When the white man came (what a familiar and mournful phrase) they were not allowed the same freedom to repossess their cattle. It became a crime, punishable by lashes under the Germans and by fines under the British, to take the cattle of other tribes. This was a gross injustice. The laibon speaks of the Masai uprising against the Germans in 1915 and of the last great war waged against the unspeakable Bantu tribes around Lake Victoria who ate fish . The warriors, in those days, he says, preferred to die rather than return home without dipping their spears in blood. Warriors now know nothing of war and cattle raiding. They are similarly ill-equipped to deal with lions. Some poison lions which are troublesome, rather than kill them with a spear. It is a shameful thing. Now the Masai are torn by the need to go to school (schule in Swahili, a leftover of German occupation) and the understanding that young people who go to school  are lost to the traditional ways. Women are particularly vulnerable to the false promises of city slickers. (I think here of Victoria.) After a short discourse about women — the need for the dowry of five animals and three useful articles to be maintained, even for schoolgirls — he speaks of Claudia. She came to live among them. His father was the laibon at the time and he had five brothers. His father wore a cloak of hyrax skins which he received along with other tools of the trade — pebbles, containers and more important, the ability to use numbers to foretell the future. He is descended directly from Kidongoi, the first laibon, who was given supernatural powers on the mountain by Ngai. (Although the tablets have been transmuted into handier, pocket-sized pebbles, the kinship with Moses seems too close to be a coincidence.) As I read, I am struck again by the laibon's sense of being at the centre of the universe. He lives near the mountain of God, in the Rift Valley in a paradise of rivers, lakes, mountains and plains. People who come from the outside world inhabit the periphery, where they have no cattle and live an inferior life. Claudia came from that world. At first, he says, people did not understand what she wanted, but she came to learn about the Masai and write it in a book. She wanted to attend the eunoto and the women's circumcision and understand everything about betrothals. She soon knew all there is to know, more than many Masai men, about the exchange of gifts, cattle and goats which always accompanies these ceremonies. At first people were suspicious; they could not understand why she was so interested in these details, which she wrote down in a schoolbook. Soon she could speak Maa. One day she brought a voice box. (Uitsmijter has written a note: ‘probably a Uher, commonly used by researchers’.) Les vrais paradis sont les paradis qu'on a perdus . I am struck by anxiety. How quickly can one learn a language? My Swahili, such as it is, comes from a Berlitz tape and a phrase book. In Claudia's time very few Masai spoke Swahili. As I  get older I find myself tormented by anxieties of this nature, the anxieties about things one will never do. They are the anxieties of our times, born of the idea that the individual must in one way or another (any damned way, as a matter of fact, even confessing to having been abused as a child) express his uniqueness and fulfil his potential. Durkheim, Claudia's inspiration, said at the beginning of the century that the problem for twentieth-century western man was the anomie created by the breakdown of the old certainties. What he could not see was the restless, self-centred consumerism it would produce. Nor did he see another consequence, as his nephew Mauss confessed, shortly before going mad: ‘how large modern societies which have more or less emerged from the Middle Ages in other respects, could be hypnotized as aborigines are by their dances and set in motion like a child's carousel. This return to the primitive had not been the object of our thoughts.’ The club is quiet. The gardens outside my window are bowing down to the heat of the afternoon, but my mind is racing in this stillness, like a dust devil on the apparently windless plains. I see myself drawing closer to Claudia Cohn-Casson, but not necessarily in the way that S. O. Letterman is expecting of me. The club and Fairfax and Lady De Marr and now the laibon's tale, seem to me to have pulled us together. It's absurd, but I feel we are all protagonists now in the same story. I have heard her voice and spoken to her lover and been walking with the Masai who was present at the farcical and tragic lion hunt. I no longer believe that I am just writing a treatment of her life. I feel as if I am poised somewhere on the edge of a slope, and about to slide down when I am supposed to be climbing up. It's crazy, but I feel as though I have no life outside this one I have found here, complete with silly old colonials and Masai witch-doctor. I haven't thought of Victoria, whose sexual peccadilloes gave me such pain, for days. Yet even as I remember Victoria, I feel keenly the unsettled state of my mind. How could I possibly have neglected to think about her when a few weeks  ago I could think of little else, in lubricious detail? I find myself instead picturing Claudia, her dark eyes turned to the sky. I see her crouching at the entrance of a hut (olpal ) looking in at, perhaps talking to, the shy bride within, who does not want to leave her father's village (engang ). I find myself attempting to memorize the Masai words as she did. I see her walking with the bride to her new village, being teased by the escort of girls. I see her, as she described, catching sight of the husband's village. And I imagine these same dark eyes catching sight of the five chimneys of Auschwitz-Birkenau. The laibon now talks about the famous incident when a district officer was killed. The British had insisted that the Masai sell some cattle to pay for schools and clinics and — there was clearly a hint of blackmail — to contribute to the war effort. Many Masai resisted this tax, but they had no choice. The laibon says that his father saw the sense in it. He didn't want the Germans back. A young man called Tepilit ole paramat, the laibon's brother, tried at the last minute to withdraw one of his cattle from the sale. The district officer in charge, known to the Masai as Tombol (Miles Turnbull) refused to allow the animal to be withdrawn and ordered his askaris to restrain Tepilit. In the presence of a few hundred Masai, the young warrior hurled his spear right through the district officer's heart. The blade appeared out of his back. Watched by the crowd, Tepilit withdrew his spear and walked away. He was eventually arrested. He did not hide and he said that he would do the same again. The bull in question had markings of which he was particularly proud. He had offered an alternative. The laibon says that his family had offered forty-nine cattle in restitution, but the British took Tepilit to the coast and hanged him there. What was achieved by that? However, some members of his family were glad, because it meant they did not have to produce cattle. Uitsmijter in a note says that the Masai have a system of  fines, multiples of seven. Forty-nine cattle is the highest possible penalty. The young man who was hanged was a special friend of Claudia. He wanted to marry her. Fairfax — Fahfakhs — who was a big man in the government had come down to the little town where Tepilit was held. Fahfakhs was wearing a uniform. He and Claudia spent a long time talking to the police and to the accused man. He, the laibon, had heard Fahfakhs shouting at the accused man in the cells at Ewaso Narok police post before he was taken to the coast. (Fahfakhs spoke fluent Maa.) The laibon's father had explained to Fahfakhs that the family was ready to pay compensation, up to the full amount possible. He had told Fahfakhs that the young man wanted to marry Claudia, and perhaps he thought that the district officer was laughing at him and treating him with contempt. Tepilit had asked Claudia in the proper way, to see if her father, wherever his village was, would accept gifts. He had given Claudia a necklace to wear in the meanwhile and called her pakiteng. (Uitsmijter explains that it is an affectionate name meaning ‘heifer’ used by betrothed people.) The laibon still could not understand the point of hanging such a man. The district officer's family got no cattle out of it either. Fahfakhs explained that Native Law did not cover this case. He had told Fahfakhs that Tepilit had actually killed a lion for the film that Claudia was making with Leavitt, whose name I had reminded him of. Tepilit had risked his life for Claudia. Two morans had been killed, and still Leavitt had not produced the promised cattle. After Tepilit was taken away to be tried, they never saw him again. Soon afterwards Claudia said she was leaving. Some said that she was going to be the wife of Fahfakhs. Many people were very sad to see her go. He, the laibon, was not so sad because he believed that she had caused many upsets. But she spoke to them all and said she would never forget them. She was going back to her father's house to show people what she  had written in her schoolbooks about them. She would come back as soon as she could. She was leaving their country with a heavy heart. Professor Uitsmijter has quite a deft touch in translation. I find myself able to place the words, in all their moving directness, right into the laibon's mouth as he spoke, with Ol Doinyo Lengai away in the distance looking like a steamed pudding, its runnelled slopes lightly coated with cream, poured from above but vitrified before reaching the base. Some time later they heard that Tepilit had been hanged. After the war was over they heard that Claudia had died. How had she died? He would like to know what happened to Claudia and her books. Nobody had ever told him. If I knew, would I tell him? Did she marry Fahfakhs? ‘Now we must go. We will go to the engang up there by Kitumbeine.’ And so, monologue complete, we had set off. The thin paper in my hand flutters as I drop it onto the bed. The ridged and tufted counterpane has been carefully and frequently laundered. The onset of the cooler hours is announced by the first thuds of tennis balls. After they hit the racquet they make another, more resonant sound, as they bounce on the ant soil surface, a sound you can hear on television when tennis is played at Stade Roland Garros. There is no sign of Fairfax and no message. I eat alone in the dining room and the next morning set off early back to Mr Shah's hotel. The journey takes seven hours."
FIC FIC-FAJ-020 -0.15 "THIRTY-ONE Fairfax speaks in short bursts, like a seal barking, when he touches on difficult matters. ‘Claudia came up to town. She had already heard the news. We didn't have dramatic scenes or anything like that, I'm afraid, if that's what you are looking for. The truth is, we rather put it behind us. I did at least. Things moved terribly fast during the war. You were always being sent somewhere. Time was precious. And we were in love. I find it hard to say, because it seems so inadequate to describe what we felt. But, yes, the truth is we were madly in love.’ Here we sit. The tin roof of the verandah is home to all sorts of creatures. Newcomers to Africa find this constant primitive motion disturbing. Insects lurch and stagger and scramble. Lizards dart and pause, treachery in their Iago eyes. Small vertebrates lurk and pounce in the bushes. Giant moths flap into lights. They are like scraps from a tailor's cutting room which have taken clumsy wing. I speculate about the number of hours Fairfax has spent, drink in hand, on insect-bombarded verandahs and stoeps. It's one of those impossible calculations where a few more noughts would make no difference, like the number of light years to Orion, whose belt Fairfax pointed out to me earlier. I have no interest in stellar location. ‘Awful, really. Poor blighter was hanged and we were dancing the night away. In her, of course, it was a reaction. I didn't realize then. In fact I didn't realize until years later,’ he says. Something lands with a soft thump on the concrete, a small death, but he does not pause. ‘We didn't think much during the war. Certainly not out here in the colonies. Although a lot of us were in action in  Europe, it still seemed rather remote. The Jewish business also seemed unreal.’ ‘Did she work on her thesis?’ ‘She would stay up all night writing sometimes. Playing her tapes and writing.’ ‘I've got some of her tapes.’ ‘Good Lord. Is her voice on them?’ ‘Yes. Do you want to hear them?’ ‘No. I don't think so. What is she saying?’ ‘She is translating Masai songs and gossip.’ He draws up his chair. It scrapes across the polished cement of the verandah. ‘How did you come by her tapes?’ he asks, perhaps fearful of unknown fact. (Who isn't?) ‘They were in her brother's loft in Montreal. He is retired now, but he had been sent all her possessions some time after the war from the house in avenue Hoche. I just called him and explained my interest and he sent them to me two days later.’ For a moment he is confused. He is rearranging his thoughts like a man trying to move heavy furniture single-handed. He is perplexed by the idea of effortless intercontinental telephoning and overnight shipment of packages. He lives in a world where the simplest transactions, phone calls, postal services, pensions, come in a miasma of suspicion and scepticism. The essence of the capitalist system is the knowledge that these basic services are simple and their outcome sure. This is why Russia will never become a western democracy. The democracy is the product of a western mind, not the other way round. The elderly mercantile brother in Montreal was bluff and cheerful on the phone. His French accent had been through the grinder in the New World, so that he sounded like a gangster in a B movie. He told me that his younger brother, Georges, had died aged just twelve, in Neuengamme having received fifty different injections of bacilli in medical experiments. He would be proud to have his sister's achievements  known. He had himself escaped, but, he said matter-of-factly, he had always felt lousy about the others. That was it. Nothing deeper. ‘You've thrown me,’ says Fairfax. ‘I didn't know she had two brothers. He would have been my brother-in-law.’ Paper-thin circumstance separates us from other lives and alliances. ‘Tomorrow I would like you to come with me to see the laibon. He is the son of the previous laibon and the brother of the man who was hanged. He had dreamed that you were coming.’ ‘A nightmare, I should think. Have you finished with me for tonight?’ ‘Of course. We can carry on tomorrow.’ ‘Good show. I'm tired of the sound of my own voice.’ His face is beginning to congeal, the reluctant eyelid is drooping and his words are becoming slurred. ‘Would you like to stay here?’ he asks. ‘I've had them make up a bed for you. Shall we set off early? Tea at five?’ At five the birds are already loud. Tea is brought by a small furtive man in a grey safari suit. The water for my shower is scented with wood-ash. It has been heated outside the room by a log fire under a petrol drum. Fairfax is seated in the dining room beneath the stuffed heads of a cabal of gloomy animals as he eats sausages and eggs. In his world these fixed points must be observed, if only because the servants expect them. We set off in my Toyota down the now familiar road, past the police Training Centre, where motorcycling policemen were once taught to do multiple handstands on BSA motorcycles, past the Firewood project, a scheme to plant a fast-growing species of tree, now abandoned, down the long, straight, rutted road lined with workshops, past the ruined dairy farm, past more shacks which are alive with banana sellers, wood choppers, and maize roasters. Soon we  are out on the savannah leaving behind the rain shadow of the mountain. But rain has fallen here, too, in that arbitrary way which makes life so unpredictable. The brown of the plains has been replaced by an underlying green, like the velvet on a stag's antlers. Fairfax hasn't been this way for twenty years. He tells me that there were once herds of antelope, thousands strong, roaming these plains. Everything he tells me of former times is suffused with loss. The sense of space is an illusion. Every inch of these plains is grazed daily. The bush, the wilderness, was a state of mind which was banished once boundaries and limits were recognized. ‘You told me’, I say as we bounce along the ever-dwindling road, ‘that you thought of marrying Lady De Marr. Have you ever been married?’ ‘I was actually married when I was with Claudia. My wife was in Devon at her father's. We were divorced in ‘forty-seven. And then six or seven years later I married again, but she died in nineteen seventy-three. I haven't been married since.’ Although age has made its inroads, I can see that Fairfax has the mark of a man who is attractive to women. He has the assurance conveyed by a lifetime of being admired. This is an embalming process. It reminds me of those handsome bottles of fruit at Fauchon, their shape and colour not only preserved but given lustre by the amber syrup they bathe in. Even here in the dusty, bounding Toyota, this old man has a distinctiveness, the clubbable, dependable qualities of what used to be called a gentleman. As we travel, the frozen side of his face is turned from me. I see only the seal profile, the rounded and compressed nose, one brown and masked eye. His skin in this brutal morning light is textured and darkened by a weft of tiny arterial threads, some almost blue. The effect is noble, an honourably acquired patina. ‘Back in nineteen forty-four when Claudia was working on her thesis, I understood intellectually’— he says the word with a certain fastidiousness —‘what she was saying about  the Masai, but as a man who knew the country and the natives, or thought I did, I couldn't really accept it. Their customs seemed to me to be too flimsy. She wanted me to believe that there was a relation to a universal spirit. It seemed a very artificial idea. After I got back to civilian life, I fell back into the habit of admiring the Masai, but regarding them as insubstantial. Now I am not so sure. Did I tell you that I was at Belsen just after it was liberated?’ ‘No. Good God.’ ‘Two days after. I was looking for Claudia.’ They weren't there.’ ‘No. We didn't know that, but I thought I could find her. I had a mad idea that she would be there. That's where my regiment was sent. When I got there our chaps were burying the bodies with bulldozers. I tried to make some enquiries.’ In the pictures of Belsen, the sheer anguish on the faces of the Tommies contrasts starkly with the indifference of the SS recorded in their cheery souvenir albums. After a few hours' driving, we stop by a small lake brimming with clear water which has tumbled down from the escarpment through dense forest. Fairfax's steward has packed sandwiches for us and an ancient vacuum flask of tea. Vervet monkeys with their anxious faces come closer to look at us. They chivvy and reproach each other as we eat. We find the laibon in the late afternoon. He shows no surprise that Fairfax has come to pay his respects after nearly fifty years. They shake hands in an unhurried fashion and exchange the courtesies. The laibon goes off for a moment and returns wearing his cloak as the old lady produces some stools. We sit in the boma, the place de l'Étoile of Masai life. Radiating outwards are the paths to the pastures and the frontiers of the Masai world. When I sit here with the laibon and his family I feel envious of their flimsy values. I am running my tape-recorder as they talk. They are too old to be worried about the physical changes that have taken place in them, but I also see that they share a certain self-regard, a comfort which — I hazard a speculation — is robbed from old people in our cities. These old chaps have some substance in the universe. Sure, they are soon going off into the night, their lights flickering and fading, but it will be with dignity. And yet dignity is a synthetic property, invented to stop the ears against the noises of humiliation. Their conversation starts slowly and in ritual fashion. I am just able to discern the formalities which are like the horns of ships circling in the fog to dock. Fairfax is in no hurry. His Maa is, as far as I can tell, fluent and unaccented. He seems transformed, as though he is speaking in tongues. He has taken on a personality, like those crackpots who claim to have been reincarnated, from another culture. He inclines his head in a way I have not seen. He issues long, philosophic vowel sounds: ‘eehh; aaie; eh-eh; hooh’, and clicks of the tongue and palate like plastic cutlery rattling. The laibon now begins to unburden himself. It is his boma and his forum. The koko serves us tea respectfully, although she smiles at me complicitly as she hands me my mug. Her ears are so stretched by ornaments that they flap as she leans towards me. From her rises that familiar scent which I take to be human. These two men and the koko knew Claudia. It seems to me almost inconceivable that they could all have survived Africa. The old lady would have been a lissome girl, like the girls now coming through the main entrance of the boma, carrying large plastic containers of water on their heads, keeping them in place by a casual touch of the hand. (I know these girls; they are the new wives of two of the laibon's elder sons. They have both been to school and like to speak their few words of English when their elders are not looking.) Fairfax turns to me: ‘The laibon is telling me about the lion hunt in which his brother was injured.’ ‘Did Claudia tell you the story?’ ‘I think she did.’ The laibon is gesturing. He stands up and mimes throwing a spear. It is a stiff movement (as crabbed as Letterman's second serve) but children gather to watch. I look at Fairfax. He nods frequently and issues his vowel noises in harmony with the narrative. He and the laibon laugh loudly, which causes the laibon to cough. The children, who stand in a small cluster near the goat enclosure, now look at each other and laugh, too, but when the laibon swings his impressive, lidded gaze towards them, they freeze. He swats the side of his head with one of his large hands and sits down again. At least half an hour goes by before the laibon breaks off to welcome the returning cattle. We have heard them for some time; now we see them, red and white on the green of the plains. What a change. They have somehow, in the few days since the rains arrived, become biblically sleek. Their flanks wobble and their eyes are moist and content. The warriors have been with them because lions have been seen in the area where they were grazing. ‘He's a nice old boy,’ says Fairfax as we watch the laibon counting in his cattle. ‘He has problems with his family, like most old people. He asked me to tell you that the government has not yet sent the compensation. He wonders if you filled in the forms correctly.’ He laughs, a short, merry bark. ‘Don't expect gratitude from these buggers,’ he says. The women and children take charge of the cattle's night-time arrangements, gently guiding and scolding them. The tion. The warriors gaze steadily and silently at Fairfax. I wonder how much they know about their parents and grandparents. One boy I have not seen before has the perfect Masai physique, tall and slender but muscular like a high jumper's. His face is arranged in planes and his long hair is  oiled and ochred. Fairfax tells me that he is a suitor, eager to lay claim to a girl who is now only eleven. He is keen to exchange the first gifts, but the laibon's family first want to see if he can cut the mustard. The laibon communes with his cattle and goats. His family is doing all the work, but he is the bishop of this church: the cattle must receive his blessing. Fairfax is happy to watch. He has no need to analyse. He has confided that he once told Claudia that in real life people do not go around analysing everyday rituals. Claudia had concluded that the rituals of life have a social significance: they are what makes us human. Incontrovertible, but so what? Arbeit Macht Frei. Hände Waschen, Nicht Vergessen . These were the social strictures of the lager which, as an anthropologist, she must have found impossible to understand. They were drawn from a deeper and darker place than this whiskery, milky, dungy communion with the cattle. Victoria had accused me of trying to thrust myself into the action while pretending I want to live a quiet life. She suspects me of a form of vanity in sidling up to the existential questions. Here, with my seal-profile friend Fairfax, in the sight of the Mountain of God, I see that Victoria may have had a point. What business is it of mine, anyway? All I have to do is get a few facts, give them some colourful detail and write the script. Nobody, and least of all S. O. Letterman, expects me to come back with answers to unanswerable questions. The laibon's cattle are streaming in in their fullness. They have all come home from their temporary manyattas. Their big eyes are content. Even their horns seem to be full of vitality. They low as they push and shove. One or two try to mount the animal in front. The Masai stand among them. They guide them with the flick of a thin stick or a gentle word. The count takes an hour. Fairfax reckons there are nearly two thousand head. He says the word ‘head’ without self-consciousness. He's been a farmer, a pilot, a director of  coffee plantations and an army officer. And he's had a glimpse of hell. ‘Do you know what I enjoy about this?’ he asks. ‘Please tell me.’ ‘I like to think that it is going on all over Masailand in fifty thousand kraals at this moment.’ But I am plagued by the thought that we have arrived at a moment in history when this is about to be swept away. Of course the swell has been gathering force for a century or more, since Joseph Thompson first saw ‘the most peculiar band of men to be found in Africa ‘. Now the wave is about to break. How many Masai will be doing this in twenty years’ time? I also wonder how many Fairfaxes will be left in twenty years. I would hate to have to tell him that a new type of gentleman has taken over the clubs and boardrooms, a man who does not consider dishonesty the property of the criminal classes and who, moreover, believes that the notion of the gentleman is negotiable. I see that what Durkheim and his pals feared has come to pass: our century has turned humanity into a commodity. It is nearly dark. We must go. Our conversation is on hold. The laibon is a descendant of the great Mbatian, the Bismarck of Masailand. He doesn't need to excuse himself for interrupting his narrative. We leave the boma which is jam-packed, seething with cattle. Fires are bright, each one a reproach to the night. Cows are being milked. Some girls are singing. The young suitor is deputed to escort us to our camp. I wonder if this is a test of bravery. Fairfax speaks to him as we walk across the plain. I trail a pace or two behind. Although the sun has gone, the moon has caught its radiance. It is rising fast — I swear I can see its motion — above the mountains. Even as it rises, it loses the counterfeit warmth of the sun which it has appropriated and becomes glacial, all its pockmarks visible. I envy Fairfax his fluency in Maa. I can only pick up the linguistic crumbs. Even professor Uitsmijter's excellent translations involve a filtration of the nuances. When the SS  forced naked and freezing prisoners to hop up and down in a swamp making frog noises, they were acknowledging the importance of language in rendering us human. (Perhaps if I knew the language, I would not have time for these facile analogies.) I want nothing more than to walk along on the darkened plain, the moon as strong as winter sunlight in London, speaking Maa with this man. He and Fairfax are laughing, but I notice that he looks around constantly, like a city dweller guiding country cousins across Oxford Street, and his heavy spear is ready. If we are eaten, he will not be celebrating his engagement. He leaves us at our camp under the trees. His tall figure, spear held on his shoulder, strides back across the savannah until the moonlight gives out and he is consumed by the landscape. Fairfax has a couple of gins and tonic ready by the time I have the fire blazing. He has forgotten that I do not drink, or perhaps he thinks I am bluffing. ‘Nice chap,’ he says. ‘Little nervous. The old laibon has quite a reputation.’ ‘Is that what he was telling you?’ ‘Yes. He needs to get betrothed fast and naturally he wants his little heifer to be rich. He's from a few miles away, near Natron. The old boy is giving him hell.’ So under the unlikely moon they were talking marital shop. I am disappointed. ‘What about the laibon? What did he have to say?’ ‘He wanted to tell me about the lion hunt Claudia organized. Bloody shambles from start to finish.’ ‘Why does the lion hunt worry him so?’ ‘I think he traces a lot of his troubles back to that time. For a start, his brother would have been the laibon. What are we eating?’ ‘I'm not sure. We've got tins of soup, beans and some sort of sausage.’ ‘Do you want me to make something?’ ‘Please.’ He opens three cans deftly with a penknife and pours the lot — mushroom soup, wieners, white beans — into a pot which he places on the fire while holding a small flashlight in his mouth. ‘That looks interesting.‘ ‘In the old days we should have thrown a guinea-fowl or a few warthog piglets in, too. The old man wants you to know that the lion hunt for the producer fellow…’ ‘Leavitt.’ ‘Leavitt, was not his doing. Claudia brought Leavitt to see his father to organize it. But Leavitt had already signed up a group of Masai from another district. In the confusion his brother was badly wounded and two men were killed. He thought you may have misunderstood.’ ‘He's already told me the story and I've read Claudia's account.’ ‘He's a troubled man.’ ‘Does he know that you and Claudia were’— I stumble —‘in love?’ ‘He does. Claudia was fast. Even by our quite advanced standards. Maybe the servant told him. You can't keep a secret like that for long.’ He laughs. It is an old-fashioned noise, the sort of sound you associate with lounge lizards — liquid and urbane. ‘Do you think he resents it? I mean, the fact that his brother was in prison while you were…?’ ‘Carrying on? No, I don't think so. The Masai are pretty tolerant in these matters in my experience. Shall we eat?’ He ladles out the contents of the pot while I am wondering if the laibon thinks it was a handy way to get rid of a rival. The stew, if that's what it is, tastes strongly of tin can. ‘May I ask you a question?’ he says. ‘Of course.’ My mouth is full of small sausages which are shedding their rubbery, indigestible skins. ‘I wanted to know why you need all this detail. It's not a documentary film, is it? I don't mind in the least, of course, I'm just curious about what you are going to do with it.’ That is the question S. O. Letterman would be asking me too if he were here. I try to answer. I explain something of my personal circumstances. We talk for many hours. In a tree an owlet whistles; it is an irritating, nosy-parker noise."
FIC FIC-FET-001 -0.26 "PROLOGUE Post-Impressionism: Royal Academy of Arts, London 1980 He signed the Friends' Book in his elegant handwriting: Alexander Wedderburn, January 22nd, 1980. She had said, peremptory as always, that he was to go straight to Room III, where ""the miraculous stuff"" was to be found. Early. So here he was, a distinguished public man, also an artist of a kind, stepping obediently through Room I (French 1880s) and Room II (British 1880s and 1890s), on a lead grey morning, to the pale grey, classical, quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase, miraculous stuff, seemed merely accurate. On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs, including an Arles ""Poets' Garden"" he hadn't seen before, but recognised, from small photographs, from charged descriptions in the painter's letters. He sat down and saw a bifurcated path, simmering with gold heat round and under the rising, spreading blue-black-green down-pointing vanes of a great pine, still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring. Two decorous figures advanced, hand-in-hand, under its suspended thickness. And beyond, green grass and geraniums like splashes of blood. Alexander was not worried about whether Frederica would turn up. She was no longer in the habit of being late: her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy, perhaps to being considerate. He himself, at sixty-two, felt, not quite accurately, that he was now too old, too settled, to be put out, by her or by anyone else. He thought with warmth of her certain approach. There had been a pattern, an only too discernible repetition in the events and relationships of his life into which she had ruggedly refused to fit. She had been a nuisance, a threat, a torment and was now a friend. She had suggested that they look at Van Gogh together, setting up another form of repetition, deliberate, contrived and aesthetic. His play, The Yellow Chair, had first been presented in 1957; he did not like to think too closely about it, as he did not like to think too closely about any of his past work. He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes, a viridian impasto, a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of blue-green, isolated black pot hooks, the painfully clear orange-red spattering. He had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter's obsession with the illuminated material world. He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter's electric quarrels with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles, the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love, the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel, the asylum fears. At first he had thought that he could write a plain, exact verse with no figurative language, in which a yellow chair was the thing itself, a yellow chair, as a round gold apple was an apple or a sunflower a sunflower. Sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes, as it were, in this naked way, so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone, the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage, the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums. But it couldn't be done. Language was against him, for a start. Metaphor lay coiled in the name sunflower, which not only turned towards but resembled the sun, the source of light. Van Gogh's idea of things had also been against him. The yellow chair, besides being brushstrokes and pigment, besides being a yellow chair, was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the Yellow House, the white walls of which should blaze with sunflowers as the windows of Gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light. Not only metaphor: cultural motif, immanent religion, a faith and a church. One thing always linked to another thing. As the Poets' Garden, a decoration for the bedroom of the ""poet Gauguin"" was more than it seemed. Some time ago I read an article on Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio and Botticelli. Good Lord! it did make an impression on me, reading the letters of those men. Arles, 1888. And Petrarch lived quite near here in Avignon, and I am seeing the same cypresses and oleanders… There is still a great deal of Greece all through the Tartarin and Daumier part of this queer country, where the good folks have the accent you know; there is a Venus of Arles just as there is a Venus of Lesbos and one still feels the youth of it, in spite of all… But isn't it true, this garden has a fantastic character which  makes you quite able to imagine the poets of the Renaissance strolling among these bushes and over the flowery grass?… The youth of it, Alexander thought. I thought I was world-weary then. In July 1890, two years after writing this, Van Gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin, and had died slowly. In 1954 Alexander, a time-obsessed man, had read the centenary edition (1953) of the Letters. He had himself been rising thirty-seven and when The Yellow Chair was put on had passed that age, was older now than Van Gogh, as he had, in the 1940s, realised that he was older than Keats. He had felt, perhaps, briefly, the power of the survivor. What nonsense. The eternal youth of Provence. He thought of thick, fat, hot motorways carving up that land. He turned his attention to the timeless fields of wheat and olives. She made a kind of progress up the Palladian marble stair. A painter stopped to kiss her: a journalist waved. John House, who had organised the exhibition, came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent-like coat. He also kissed Frederica and introduced the woman, fumbling her name, as ""a colleague"" and Frederica as ""Frederica — you must forgive me, I never know what name you re working under, women these days are so protean.""  Frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name, having given up interest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern. She assumed wrongly that John House's colleague was an art historian. The colleague looked at Frederica with an apparently absent-minded scanning attention. John House spoke of the history of the gathering of the images, an emptiness here Jacob wrestling the Angel), an unexpected illumination there. Frederica listened attentively; went on and signed the Visitors' Book. Frederica Potter, Radio 3 Critics' Forum. She negotiated a free catalogue. She made her leisurely way towards where she had told Alexander to be. An old woman, armed with a Sound Guide, became quite excited and pulled at the arm of another.  ""Hey — look at that — Winston Churchill painted that, the…"" — carefully — ""Cap d'Antibes.""  Frederica dipped round her to stare: Claude Monet: ""Au Cap d'Antibes par vent de mistral"" . A whirl of blue and rose, for in less formed plungings of water and wind.  ""To paint,"" she remembered from Proust's description of fictive Elstir, ""that one does not see what one sees.""  To paint light and air between ourselves and objects.  ""I said, dear, Winston Churchill —"" The second woman tugged free of the  clutching fingers.  ""Not to be mentioned in the same breath with…"" she said, looking nervously from Frederica to painted signature. The arrested water shone and danced. In the catalogue John House quoted Monet's description of the painted light around the snowy haystacks as an enveloping veil. He also quoted Mallarmé""I think…that there should be only allusion… To name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem, which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it. To suggest it, that is the dream."" It was not a view of things with which Frederica was entirely in sympathy: she liked naming names. But she looked briefly down, dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea, the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks. She scribbled words, notes, in the margin of her catalogue. Daniel bought a ticket, and paid for the hire of a catalogue, he wasn't sure why. He had come, he believed, because he needed to discuss certain administrative problems with Frederica. He was aware that she believed he was in need of art. Under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day's headline: PEACE MOTHER DIES. He was raw to bad news, more raw as he grew older, which was not perhaps quite what he had expected. He saw and did not see the paintings. There was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large, faded and ghostly versions of Van Gogh's ""Harvest"" which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors, waiting rooms, school offices. He had seen these ample fields, as he had seen Cezanne's geometric brown and green undergrowth in more than one mental hospital day room. Odd, he thought, considering that Van Gogh himself had died mad and despairing in such surroundings. Not serene, overexcited, these fields. Daniel's patience with the nervously ill was not what it had been. Although he was fourteen years younger than Alexander, Daniel too was in the habit of thinking of himself as a survivor, a battered and grizzled survivor. Alexander saw her coming towards him. A dozen or so schoolgirls were dutifully filling in xeroxed, hand-written, one-word-answerable questionnaires. Alexander, always a connoisseur of garments, realised that Frederica had changed her style, that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody of the clothes Frederica had worn at their age, and that Frederica's new style was not unrelated to this shift. There she was in a conventional two-piece  suit, fine dark wool, muted geometrical pattern in greens and unexpected straw browns, caught in at the waist — still very thin — to give the effect of a bustle, the skirt long and straight to the knee. She had ruffles (not swashbuckling) at the neck and the small velvet hat could, but did not, support a veil. The pale red hair was in a figure of eight chignon in her neck, reminiscent of one of Toulouse-Lautrec's fine-drawn cafe habituées. Fifties and post-impressionist, thought Alexander, connecting. She came up and kissed him. He remarked on the parody-young. She took the point eagerly. ""My dear, I know. Pencil skirts and batwing sweaters and spiky stilettos, tottering with their hard little behinds sticking out, and all that red lipstick. I remember when I thought lipstick had gone forever, a dream of painted excess, as I thought paper taffeta had gone forever, in Cambridge, when we all took to glazed cotton. Do you remember?""  ""Of course.""  ""Do you remember the eclectic Sixties parodies — when we went to the National Portrait Gallery — everything, from swamis to major-generals and major-domos too. These are such a serious and uniform parody. More and more of the same. More of me."" ""Lèse-majesté. And you? You have reverted to type?"" ""Oh, I'm in my element. I understand the Fifties. I couldn't do the Forties bit at all, padded shoulders and crêpy things, ugh, and pageboys — I think it must have been purely Oedipal, those were my parents' things, dammit, what I was getting away from . This is my scene.""  ""So it is.""   ""And now I have money.""   ""In our new austerity, you have money.""   ""In our new austerity, I am old enough to have money.""  They saw Daniel advancing.  ""Daniel doesn't change,"" said Alexander.  ""Sometimes I wish he did,"" said Frederica. Daniel did not change. He wore the same black clothes — baggy corduroys, heavy sweater, working-man's jacket — that he had worn through the Sixties and Seventies. Like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant, but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard, and his body was still compact and very heavy. He looked, in this setting, a little like some painter. He saluted Frederica and Alexander with his rolled  newspaper and said that it was cold outside. Frederica kissed him too, reflecting that he was dressed like a man who smelled dirty, but in fact didn't. Alexander smelled, still, of Old Spice and a sort of agreeable toastiness. His smooth brown hair was as thick as ever but shot now with needles of glittering silver.  ""We must talk,"" said Daniel. ""First you must look at the pictures. Take time off."" ""I keep trying. I went to the King's Carol Service.""  ""Good for you.""  Frederica glanced shrewdly at him.  ""Now, look at the pictures.""  Gauguin's ""Man with the Axe"" .  ""One for you,"" said Frederica to Alexander, still skimming the necessary accompanying print. ""Androgynous. John House says. No, Gauguin said. Do you think?"" Alexander considered the decorative gold body, itself a repetition of a body on the Parthenon frieze. He saw a blue loincloth, flat breasts, purple sea with coral tracings lying flatly on it. He was unmoved, though the colours were rich and strange. He told Frederica he preferred his androgynes to be more obscured, more veiled, more suggested, and directed her attention to ""Still-Life, Fete Gloanec 1888"" in which various inanimate objects, two ripe pears, a dense bunch of flowers, swam across a bright red table-top rimmed with a black ellipse. The picture was signed ""Madeleine Bernard"" , and Alexander told Frederica that Gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman, had characterised her, as was fashionable at the time, as having the desirable, unattainable androgynous perfection, complete sensuality combined with unattainable self-sufficiency. Frederica informed him from the catalogue that the vegetation was supposed to be a jocular portrait by Gauguin of Madeleine, the pears her breasts, the dense flowers her hair.  ""You could read it another way,"" said Alexander, interested now, ""you could read the pears as androgynous in themselves, as partly male.""   ""And the hair as other hair,"" said Frederica loudly, scandalising a few bystanders, amusing a few more.  ""You like to cork for your images, don't you, Alexander?""   ""It's age,"" said Alexander, peaceably, untruthfully. They were beginning to attract a penumbra of gallery-goers, as though they were offering a guided tour. They moved on to the ""Olive Pickers"" . Daniel's mind was elsewhere. He remembered a straight mass of red-gold hair, in cold King's Chapel, more golden than foxy Frederica's, slowly settling onto a collar as the pins released their grip. He saw a mass of freckles — sometimes  melding into sixpenny-sized brown patches of warmth — moving over the hard frame of cheekbones and brow. The sexless voices rose in the cold.  ""Unto us a Boy is born.""   ""Herod then with wrath was filled.""  The voices played with the slaughter of the innocents, treble and descant hunting each other, while she bowed her head, unable to sing in tune. The olives had been painted from the asylum at St Rémy in 1889. As for me, I tell you as a friend, I feel impotent when confronted with such nature, for my Northern brains were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots as I felt one ought to do better things with the foliage. Yet I did not want to leave things alone entirely, without making an effort, but it is restricted to the expression of two things — the cypresses — the olive trees — let others who are better and more powerful than I reveal their symbolic language… Look here, there is another question that comes to mind. Who are the human beings that actually live among the olive, the orange, the lemon orchards? Frederica and Alexander held a discussion of natural supernaturalism. Daniel looked at the pink sky, the twisted trunks, the silvery leaves, the rhythmic earth streaked with yellow ochre, with pink, with pale blue, with red-brown. Olives, Frederica agreed with Alexander, could not recall the Mount of Olives, the Garden of Gethsemane, in the day of Van Gogh the pastor's son, the lay preacher. As the cypresses must always, differently, mean death. Daniel asked, for politeness really, why Van Gogh had been mad, was it just that he was driven? Alexander said that it may have been a form of epilepsy, exacerbated by the atmospheric-electric disturbances of the mistral and the heat. Or you could make a Freudian explanation. He felt guilty towards the child who had not survived, for whom he had been named. He had been born on March 30th 1853. His dead brother, Vincent Van Gogh, had been born on March 30th 1852. He was in flight from his family, his dead alter ego, his uncertain sense of identity. He wrote to Theo, ""I hope you are not a"" Van Gogh"". Essentially I am not a ""Van Gogh"" . I have always looked upon you as Theo Daniel said he could not see the pain Frederica said was in the olives, and Alexander, still lecturing, said that Vincent had objected to paintings of symbolic Christs in Gethsemane by Bernard and his compères, had torn up his own, had  made do with the olives themselves. He told Daniel about the terrible St Rémy painting of the blasted tree, about noir-rouge, and Daniel said that it was odd that these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now, to cheer people up. The trees stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes, small flying things, solidified light movements or saccades of the eye, brushstrokes, pigment. Here is a description of a canvas which is in front of me at the moment. A view of the park of the asylum where I am staying; on the right a grey terrace and a side wall of the house. Some deflowered rose bushes, on the left a stretch of the park — red-ochre — the soil scorched by the sun, covered with fallen pine needles. This edge of the park is planted with large pine-trees, whose trunks and branches are red-ochre, the foliage green gloomed over by an admixture of black. These high trees stand out against an evening sky with violet stripes on a yellow ground, which higher up turns into pink, into green. A wall — also red-ochre — shuts off the view, and is topped only by a violet and yellow-ochre hill. Now the nearest tree is an enormous trunk, struck by lightning and sawed-off. But one side branch shoots up very high and lets fall an avalanche of dark green pine needles. This sombre giant — like a defeated proud man — contrasts, when considered in the nature of a living creature, with the pale smile of a last rose on the fading bush in front of him… To Emile Barnard, St Rémy, December 1889. You will realise that this combination of red-ochre, of green gloomed over by grey, the black streaks surrounding the contours, produces something of the sensation of anguish, called ""noir-rouge"" from which certain of my companions in misfortune frequently suffer I am telling you about this…to remind you that one can try to give an impression of anguish without aiming straight at the historic Garden of Gethsemane Daniel thought about dead Ann Maguire who, like Anna Van Gogh, the Dutch pastor's wife, had named a younger, hopeful child for a dead one. (Though in Van Gogh's case, the names, Theodorus, Vincent, Vincent, Theodorus, appeared and reappeared from generation to generation, the cultural parallels to certain persisting aspects of the family face, a heavy brow, an intense blue eye, a cheek bone, a nostril.) In the churchyard in his last parish a family in the English  1870s had tried to name a son Walter Cornelius Brittain and had buried three, aged five, aged two, aged one month, interspersed by variegated dead daughters, a Jennet, a Marian, an Eva. In August 1976 a car, containing an IRA gunman, possibly already dead, ploughed onto a pavement and killed three of Mrs Maguire's children, Joanne, eight, John, two, Andrew, six weeks, leaving one son, Mark, aged seven. People had been shocked, by numbers as well as by gratuitous death itself, as people will be, and Mrs Maguire's sister and a friend had founded the Peace People, whose brave beginning and sad end will not be chronicled here. Ann Maguire had borne a second Joanne, in New Zealand, from where she had returned, unable to bear cultural transplantation. Although the papers referred to her as the Peace Mother she had not been active in the Peace People. She had brought a case for legal compensation for her dead children's lives and for her own suffering and one of her few recorded public utterances was to call the first offer of compensation ""pitiful"" . The day of the hearing of her second case she had been found dead. Daniel had pieced the story together from the radio: ""with throat wounds. Foul play was not suspected,""and from conflicting newspapers.  ""With hedge-cutters"" .  ""With a carving knife"" .  ""With an electric carving-knife""  ""by her side"" . Her motives, the coroner was to say, were ""not completely easy to understand"" . Daniel, who had become a specialist in wild blows of chance, thought he understood some of it. He had not prayed for Ann Maguire. He was not that kind of priest. He had metaphorically shaken a large fist, impotently, at some looming energy-field, and got on with his work, his work. He followed the other two into the dark shadows of the room housing the Low Countries. Nuns ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white caps. The Lauriergracht in Amsterdam was gloomed and glittering. Mondriaan's ""Evening"" was sombre and cloudy. He liked these. Like Vincent, although he was unaware that Vincent had remarked on it, he had ""Northern brains"" and responded biologically and spiritually to tones of black, donkey-brown, varied greys, touches of white in dark.  ""One of the most beautiful things done by the painters of this country has been the painting of black which nevertheless has light in it,"" Vincent had written from Holland. Xavier Mellery, the painter of the nuns, was described in the catalogue as ""creating a light which is the negation of that which  envelops our immediate visual experience of things; it is rather the Interior light of your mind…""  Daniel was used to such language; it was his daily, or anyway weekly, pabulum. He knew about the light shining in darkness, and had come, for reasons completely different from Alexander's desire for exactness, specificity, to mistrust figurative language. He never now made a sermon from a metaphor, nor drew analogies: he preached examples, cases, lessons. But he liked the black Dutch paintings: they were, so to speak, on his wavelength. He cornered Frederica.  ""You said you'd news of Will.""   ""A postcard, yes.""   ""Where this time?""  ""Kenya. On the way to the Ugandan famine, I think.""  ""Hippie,"" said Daniel.  ""Helping out,"" said Frederica. ""What use — comparatively — is a chap like that, wi' no training, no medical…no…? Another mouth to feed. It makes me wild."" ""I think he is often useful, in his way. You judge him so """" He judges me. Judging runs in the family.""  ""It does,"" said Frederica.  ""Once,"" said Daniel,""I was in Charing Cross Hospital, someone's kid had taken an overdose and died, they pump them out there regular as clockwork but this one's liver couldn't take any more. Anyway, there I was, going up this endless corridor, thinking what to do about the mother, who blamed herself — wi' reason mind you, she was one of those soft suckering witch-women, but that made it worse, not better — and there was th' trolley wi' the dead girl on it, sliding by me — sheet right over, porters in those soft theatre boots and floppy plastic bathcaps — and when they'd got past me and were turning in't door, the first one looked at me from under his plastic frills like, with my own face. I was shocked for a minute. Got all his hair tucked up in that thing, you see — otherwise, he's not so like me, not strikingly so.  ""Hi,"" he said.  ""Going about your father's business, are you?""  So I asked him what he was up to and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it, and then he pushed th ""trolley in, and I went in after, and the mother began her howling and shrieking, and Will said,"" Well, I'll walk off and leave you to it."" And I said, ""Where are you going, then?""  And he said,""I told you. To and fro."" That was the last I saw of Will."" The nuns ascended the stairs in a perpetual cool silence.  ""Quoting scripture for his own purposes,"" said Daniel.  ""That was rather funny, I thought,"" said Frederica. ""Anything on the postcard about coming back? Any plans?""  ""No.""  Sometimes she wished Will would not write to her at all, if he would send no messages to Daniel. Sometimes she told herself the postcards, or exercise book scrawls, were messages to Daniel, but one should never, she considered, ignore surface meanings in favour of implications and the damned things were addressed to her, to Frederica.  ""Oh hell,"" she said.  ""Not to worry,"" said Daniel. ""I'll push off. I'll see you.""  ""You haven't seen the pictures.""   ""I'm not in the mood.""   ""We were going to have coffee in Fortnum and Mason's.""   ""No, thank you all the same."" "
FIC FIC-FET-005 -0.27 "4. Midi When Frederica left for Nîmes she had no real idea of the South. She knew that Nîmes was a provincial city and would have preferred it not to be, seeing ""provincial"" in terms of the English nineteenth century novel, not of the Roman Provincia, Provence. Drifting citywards in her generation, she had really hoped for Paris and bright  lights. She had booked a sleeper from Paris in terms of time — ""I can't sit up all night"" — not distance ""I am going a long way south.""  When she boarded this train she became involved in an altercation with the sleeping-car attendant, which she enjoyed, because it was in French, and she was able to use her subjunctives and conditionals, and say ""si"" instead of ""oui"" at appropriate moments. She lost the argument, which was about her reservation, which was for berth No. 7 in English which the conductor obstinately read as 1 in French. Frederica explained that in France the 7 is crossed but that this is not done in Thomas Cook's in Calverley, N. Yorkshire. The attendant said there was a gentleman already undressing in No. 1 Frederica received no answer to her question about numéro sept, but was given permission to stand in the corridor of the train, which was already sliding away from its platform. She watched Paris rattle past, foreign blocks of lit windows, knots of wire, and she was offered a Gauloise by a compact little man who leaned his elbow companionably against hers on the window-rail. She accepted the cigarette as she accepted most offerings, and still elated at the sound of her French being understood and responded to by Frenchmen, volunteered the information that she was going to Nîmes, to stay with a family. She would have told him much more, all sorts of improper things, only to hear the old information newly proposed in new words. She would be lucky, the man told her, to see the South in spring. The maquis smells wonderful. For the first time Frederica's imagination touched at the South. He was going to St Raphael himself, the man said. He was a traveller. He sold liqueurs, mostly to the hotel industry. He could offer mademoiselle a taste of Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Chartreuse, if she really had no berth. Frederica replied brightly that would be very agreeable. This was despite a strong sense that the man was unduly anxious about the outcome of his overture: anxiety is a great destroyer of response, and Frederica had no taste for being closed in a sleeping compartment with a worried man. On the other hand she did not want to stand until dawn, and she did want the French words to go on being threaded together. The sleeping-car attendant came back and announced that by great good fortune he had an empty berth for which the occupant had unaccountably not appeared. He ushered Frederica into No. 7, and stood, perhaps awaiting a tip, which she was unable to offer, being provided only with notes of large denominations. This caused her to close herself abruptly in, without  the traveller in liqueurs. And then she was delighted by the solitude of the sleeping-car, and forgot him. She undressed partly and padded about the perpetually shifting floor in stocking feet, suspenders, slip and bra. She investigated ring hooks, water flask, lidded washbasin. She tried to peer out of the peephole in her blind. A station clashed by so fast she could neither read its name or discern the pattern of its ironwork. Black masses of bush, or bull, or thatch elongated themselves howling. She liked that. She liked to be alone in a warm, lit box with the world streaming darkly by. She curled on her bunk, admired her long legs, thought about desire (not for the traveller in liqueurs), read part of Madame Bovary, part of Les Fleurs du Hal and all of a novel by Margery Sharp, bought on impulse at the Gare de Lyon. She saw the dawn when it came and pulled up the blind. There in the pale lemon grey were expanses of espaliered rows of strange stumps like truncated Virginia creepers, squat and tough. These large spaces did not rush past but seemed endless because endlessly repeated. Understanding took time. Vines in her mind trailed over trellises, depended from arbours, clung. Round these orderly gnarled wooden roots the cold soil heated almost visibly as the incredible bright dawn advanced. She dressed carefully, green herring-bone tweed suit, pinch-waisted, court shoes, very plain, and a complicated face, the tricky little eyeliner triangles at the lid-corners almost smudged by the swaying train. She had a sort of velvet cap, from which she had snipped a bit of veiling. She believed cheap clothes could be made elegant by paring them down to essentials. Sometimes this worked, sometimes she looked tarty, sometimes she looked drab. On that morning, descending the steel ladder onto the sandy Nîmes siding in two-inch heels and an inverted tulip skirt, she looked all these things. The Grimaud family had written to say that they would meet her with a blue Corvette. It was only at this late stage that she began to think about them; they had been a means to an end, Frederica Potter's removal from Blesford and Yorkshire. A large man and a small boy appeared at the other end of the platform: she hobbled on her heels, humping her heavy suitcase, towards them. They greeted her and introduced themselves — Monsieur Grimaud and Paul-Marie. Paul-Marie had un-English shorts, long white socks, olive-brown legs. Frederica ignored him. M. Grimaud swung up her bag, smiling. He had a wide waistline, iron-grey hair en brosse, a tanned face with  smile-lines set round the mouth, a signet ring, gold serpent coiled round bloodstone. He was at ease in his skin. He asked about her journey, and sitting beside him in the car she recounted the mix-up over the sleeper numbers, enjoying, still, hearing herself speak French. M. Grimaud laughed. He swung the car out into Nîmes and beyond Nîmes into the countryside, straight roads with plane trees, cultivated wild land right and left. M. Grimaud explained everything easily, with a French educational fervour and a local passion which Frederica was too culturally inexperienced — and too confused — to place. The lovely light, as they travelled, grew and grew. The fields here, M. Grimaud said, were fields of lavender, a major Provincial industry. Here she was in the land of the Langue d'Oc which must be distinguished from the Langue d'Oil. He spoke of troubadours and ancient lords and sang, unembarrassed and unaffected, snatches of song about lavender, about almond trees, about love, in incomprehensible Proven-am. Frederica saw the long ridges of dusty grey-green lavender leaves and imagined violet spikes. She saw unshadowed earth in yellow light, more vines, new shoots of what she did not recognise as young maize. Later, travelling knowledgeably south at thirty, at forty, full of accrued wisdom about good little places, local food and wine, Cafes Routiers and long-vanished sand dunes she tried to remember the surprises, only half-experienced that day, of that land to her unexpecting eyes. It had seemed, because she was, raw and new, dust and brightness. And the smells, the beginning of the smells of the south, more immediately apprehensible, more durable in the memory, at least when re-evoked. Herbs in rough places, juniper, rosemary and thyme, which she would have named but not identified, oregano which she could not even have named. They approached the propriété along an avenue lined with limes — tilleuls, a word, a name, already in her vocabulary, but now suddenly associated with a solid form and gusts of fragrance. M. Grimaud discoursed on the making of tisanes, and made obscure references to Marcel Proust. Tisane, like tilleul, was in Frederica's vocabulary, the word, not the thing, but it was some time yet before she would understand their connection with Proust, who had entered her consciousness largely through a striking nightmare, dreamed the night before her Oxford entrance examination, which she recalled, as M. Grimaud talked and the scented trees brushed past. In this dream she had been locked into the school library with an exam paper containing one question and one only: Compare and  contrast narrative method in Proust and Tom Jones. She knew nothing about either and in the dream wept bitterly from shame and impotence. When she woke she was further annoyed at having dreamed a category confusion, a man and a book, not realising that the category error was partly the answer to the uncouth question, since Proust was coterminous with a book as the eponymous Tom Jones was not. She was never to think of that dream without some of its investing emotions, shame and irritation, even after a man at a party in 1969 had told her such dreams are dreamed typically by those unlikely to fail plausible and real exams. Then, in 1954, as the car passed under what seemed a mediaeval or Renaissance courtyard gate there was Frederica, brooding grimly about a personal failure in a dreamed, unreal competition. In later years, say 1964, 1974, 1984, the first vision of Nozières took on its perfection and primacy, as it is only after the mind has cleared itself of the flow of daily preoccupation, planning, expectation, that the moment of a death can be known for what it is, and one's life mapped, prospectively and retrospectively, to that threshold. The yard was walled in gold stone covered with clean dust and lichen-stains. Hens ran, calling. Madame Grimaud, short and trim with a well-managed waist, solid hips and strictly upswept smooth black hair, stood on the doorstep with two cross-looking and awkward teenage daughters, to whom Frederica was to be required to converse. Mediterranean women in black dresses — Frederica's first sight of these — moved around and behind this group. There was a lot of formal handshaking and Frederica, directed in part by the nature of the language, spoke several formal French sentences of graceful gratitude. Inside, at a huge oak table in a stone dining-hall, dark-walled and tiled, she was given a bowl of hot chocolate, a huge piece of French bread, unsalted butter (again the first) and confiture aux cerises. She was conducted up flights of stone stairs with wrought-iron balustrades to her huge room, whose walls were painted a bright dark blue — a colour which reminded her of a postcard of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" , and even more of the colour behind the fleurs de lys on the banners in Olivier's film of Henry V. Its powdery darkness amazed her: no English room was ever dark blue: maybe this was more like Reckitt's blue? The floor was faded blue and tawny tiles. The bed was high, high and curtained, covered with lace and bobbled crocheted cotton. There was a wash hand-stand with ewer, slop bucket and china washbasin. The room was twice the size of the sitting-room at home in Masters  Row at Blesford. There was neither writing-table nor desk, though there was a whole set of heavy, yellow-painted bedroom furniture, wardrobe, cupboard, chest. It was alien. It was interesting. She was excited by so many strange things. She was also exhausted. And, to her horror, briefly homesick for carpets, bookcases, small casement windows, man-made heating devices, the familiar, the known. Later, at least for many years, she was not to see this time as part of her life, and perhaps therefore it need not now be told at length. Frederica's recall of things seen was very much less lucid and automatic than those of Stephanie or even Marcus. Her mind was self-referring and exclusive as theirs were not — impersonal only in relation to the teasing-out of the intellectually taxing problem. In the 1970s Ezra Pound's laminated view of vital and moribund cultures, centred partly on Provence, made her see M. Grimaud's easy educating communications about the land, the lore, the language in which she found herself, as a sign of real energy in his community which had been ersatz, or only wished-for, in post-Festival of Britain Yorkshire. Bill Potter had his local pride: his evening class students collected local words, described patterns of social behaviour and family interrelationship with a kind of Fabian zeal, but without the sun-saturated liveliness of M. Grimaud's sense of what was shared and perpetual in his world. This family, which was not her own, which threw her own, absent and dispersed, into sharp relief, was certainly kind. M. Grimaud was captain of a ship that ran between Marseille and Tunis. He was away for weeks at a time and would return laden with gigots of Algerian lamb, jars of oil, sacks of pulses; Madame ran the propriété, which was large, and not labour-intensive (words that entered Frederica's vocabulary ca. 1960). There were hectares of vineyards — she never knew how many — and orchards of peaches, cherries, melons. There was at least a sufficiency of migrant Italian house and garden servants, who rendered any conventional mother's help more than redundant. Frederica, who did not even make her own bed, acquired one or two odd skills. She learned to cut asparagus daily, in the wide, ridged, humped beds outside the golden walls, spying out newly poking purple heads, slicing, with a gritty sharp knife, just under the soil. She also learned to assist in the preparation of foods she believed herself, in 1954, to dislike: aïoli, estouffade de boeuf, kid stewed with wine, tomatoes and garlic, potage de legumes hand-wound through a  Mouli, dressed salads made with unknown leaves and fronds, crimson, cream-white, spinach-dark, curly pale green. She turned the handle of the spit when the Algerian gigots were roasted, larded with garlic and anchovies, in a kind of oval cage of iron slats in front of a hot fire of vine-stumps inside the huge hearth; she sat on a bench inside the cheminée, turning the ratchet as it wound down, basting the lamb with oil and its own juices from a diabolical long spoon. Her one apparent asset, her good French, turned out to be a disadvantage. Marie-Claire and Monique learned little English because Frederica intimidated them and they intimidated her. She rewrote their homework in respectable English but appeared, at that time, not to have inherited the family teaching compulsion, and was unable to explain the principle by which she was altering their grammar and syntax. Thus, although their marks improved, the two girls were not learning. Only much later did it occur to her that this was her failure: academically self-sufficient and wholly self-centred she saw their sullenness and ignorance as their concern and their fault. Madame Grimaud treated all this with brisk courtesy, remarking on one occasion that it could at least be said that Frederica was a good moral influence. Frederica saw this observation at the time as a mark of signal failure of insight. Later, in England, it occurred to her that it might have been said ironically, but by then she had forgotten the context and intonation of it, could only remember that it was said under hot sun outside the Maison Carrée in Nîmes, where the air was fluent and the stones shone. They made courteous and persistent attempts to amuse her. On the second day they gave her a rubber ball attached on a long elastic thread to a wooden bat. She stood in the courtyard, solemnly playing, seventeen, sex-starved, muscle-bound, an intellectual shark, at Jokari. She was no good at this. The domestiques and Madame Grimaud observed her failure solemnly from doors and windows as they moved about their household works. Frederica was put in mind, mutatis mutandis, starting with the intention, of Miss Havisham bidding the boy Pip to play, of the brewery yard where he had met Herbert Pocket, which (the yard) irked her, because she could not properly visualise it. She was taken everywhere. To the covered fish market at dawn to buy fish for a bouillabaisse, which held no romance for her for she had not then read Ford's description of the great bouillabaisse in the Calanques, nor Elizabeth David's description of the colours and  patterns of fish on the stalls. She went to the dressmaker with Madame Grimaud, where there was a stocky replica, adjustable, of Madame Grimaud's female French form standing headless on a metal leg. Everyone knew everyone and stopped to speak to everyone. She thought she remembered lovebirds at the dressmaker, and did remember dark coffee and langues de chat. The lovebirds in her mind fused into a watching parrot, perhaps made by the metal leg. She visited neighbouring propriétés and sipped aperitifs from unlabelled bottles, white port on terraces, in arbours trailing wisteria, under acacia trees. In two of these families there were young men, sons and heirs who would inherit the land, unspeaking grave Michel, noisy Dany with one word of English — ""bluejeans"" — and an explosive Lambretta churning up pale, clean dust. She had ideas about these two, especially about Michel, but saw that to them she was invisible, not quite real, as au pair girls frequently, perhaps usually, are. She spoke a lot, and they turned and congratulated each other on her French, as though she was some sort of barrel-organ she thought, being not only sex-starved but starved also of admiration. When Monsieur was at home, more cultural and purposeful expeditions were undertaken. They went to a floodlit performance of Mireille in the Roman arena in Nîmes. In the same place, one day, Frederica saw bullfighting. She had hoped to understand the aesthetic excitement of this pursuit, to see and recognise the ""moment of truth"" even if she must simultaneously be revolted. But all she saw was slow, repeated, stumbling, coughing killings at which she retched in a very conventional English animal-loving way, which upset Monsieur Grimaud, who was an aficionado, and had been lecturing Frederica on the provenance and meaning of that word. The place suddenly had its history of bloodletting to be sniffed, and yet even that was not exciting, maybe because the Nîmois did not roar for blood as the Romans had, but sunned themselves and discussed finer points of capework. They did, it was true, have an agitated fit of booing and hissing, but this was, M. Grimaud explained, an expression of spontaneous disapproval of Picasso who could just be made out, small brown face under black beret at the other side of the arena. The crowd, M. Grimaud stated, thought his art was fraudulent and Frederica, trying in vain to imagine any English football crowd holding any communal view about any modern artist, suddenly remembered the Picasso prints on the walls of Alexander Wedderburn's study in Blesford Ride School. She had been in love with  Alexander. Here, distant from home and muddle, she was sure she was still in love with Alexander. She had made, circumstances had made, rather a mess of this love. She did not think he would like to hear from her, or possibly even to think about her. His Picassos had been Blue Period, the Saltimbanques, a strange Boy with a Pipe, crowned with flowers. It was odd to sit here, so far away, in sun and shouting, and see the small dark and light rounds of the face of the man who had made those images. His lines are very economical, she said to M. Grimaud, who looked solidly startled at this view and spoke dismissively of women with three breasts, or single eyes, paintings more infantile than those of Cromagnon man. Moreover, he said, Picasso had discovered and ruined the traditional potteries at Vallauris which now turned out only nasty ash-trays with distorted bulls and gross doves. He has killed the tradition he loved, M. Grimaud said with contempt. Frederica thought he was being philistine and was later to learn that he was being simply truthful. The drawings of bullfights, however, have real merit, M. Grimaud assured her, which silenced her, since she didn't know the drawings and was sick of the bullfight. Afterwards bleeding bull steaks hung from hooks in butchers' windows, or lay overlapping on white plates. The Grimaud family purchased and cooked many of these — it was customary, Frederica was told. Frederica gagged on hers, nauseated by a memory of the foundering black body as the life left the legs, of the crawling sheet of sticky blood over the shoulder under the pics, of trailing hooves and horns dragged over sawdust. She was later to discover that a certain J. Olivier believed that Vincent Van Gogh's self-mutilation in Arles was an aspect of some bull-ritual. The victorious matador, he said, was awarded the ear of the bull, which he would offer ""to his Lady or to a female spectator who has drawn his attention"" . (No ears were awarded on the day of Frederica's visit to the corrida.) So, J. Olivier argues, Van Gogh, vanquished and vanquisher both, cut off his own ear after the altercation with Gauguin and presented it, in his own honour, to the lady, the Arles whore. The vignoble produced a reasonable vin rose which she drank like water every lunchtime. Unlike Marie-Claire, Monique and Paul-Marie, she did not add water, believing it to be childish or in doubtful taste to dilute good wine. The result was burning headaches, dizzy spells and prolonged periods of lassitude which the Grimauds, courteous as always, ascribed to the mistral, to heat, to unaccustomed diet. They may have been glad, since she was turning out to be hard to amuse, that she slept deeply in the early afternoons. There were no books. M. Grimaud told her how Nîmes had been settled by the veterans of Octavius's victory over Antony and Cleopatra, whose names, Antonin, Numa, Flavien, Adrien, persisted, even today, as did the emblem of the defeat of the serpent of old Nile, the Nîmes chained crocodile. He took her to Uzès where Racine had once come to ruralise, contemplate the priesthood, began to write. Uzès was and is a town out of another time, a yellow town on a gently conical hill, geometrical roof on roof, a town that must have been as it now is when Shakespeare wrote Antony and Cleopatra. Frederica tried to talk to M. Grimaud about Racine but, although he could quote several speeches, he was more interested in what Racine was and meant than in what he had written. He had a Racine, a Molière, a Chateaubriand. Frederica borrowed also Hemingway in translation, and read about bullfights and the earth moving, which caused her to feel worse, sex-starved, desperate for life, and love, and action. She also developed a need for the English language. Madame took her to the City Library in Nîmes, a gaunt, dark building with high shutters behind grilles and dusty leather books, ceiling high. There was not much in English: she borrowed the complete works of Tobias Smollett. These were not what she was hungry for, but they were English, and narrative. Narrative is one of the best intoxicants or tranquillisers. They were at least long. Madame then thought of the vélo. On this Frederica explored the unvarying hot flat country. She bumped along furrows between vines, spattered cobalt-blue with spraying. She listened to cicadas and breathed the pervasive liquorice which grew locally and was processed in a factory on the Nîmes road. Whenever she fell off the vélo she sat where she was, nodding, fumed with wine and drowsy with heat, in a classical furrow, under a pale, bright sky. She decided to become a writer. It was almost inevitable, given the excessive respect paid in the Potter house to the written word, and given Frederica's own mastery of, and intense pleasure in, the school essay, that she should decide to become a writer. Foreign places, moreover, bring out the writer in strangers less word obsessed than Frederica Potter. I do not think the compulsion to write about foreign places can be very closely compared to a painter's  sensuous delight in new light, new forms, new colours, Monet seeing the Cap d'Antibes in blue and rose, Turner seeing the bright watery Venetian light in Venice, Gauguin in Tahiti. Pigment is pigment and light is light in any culture. But words, acquired slowly over a lifetime, are part of a different set of perceptions of the world, they have grown with us, they restrict what we see and how we see it. I am trying to account for the paradox of the sameness of so many accounts, in language, of the strange, the exotic, the new. Frederica will do as an example to illustrate the difficulties of writing about strangeness. She wanted to set down the southern landscape. Her tradition of looking at landscape was deeply Wordsworthian, whatever intimations she may have had that Wordsworth's language was for his time and place only. Frederica could, in the Lake District, have seen a ""Wordsworthian"" tarn and been able to render it in Wordsworthian words, and, because these words were known, tested, thought about, she could have introduced minute changes, have seen one little thing he hadn't seen, changed the point of view. There are shepherds in the Andes who have over sixty words for the colour brown in the coats of sheep. But they are shepherds in the Andes. Frederica had words for tea party behaviour and shopping discriminations in North Yorkshire matrons. She had a variety of words, and was adding to them, for the structure of a Shakespearean plot or metaphor. She saw these new things, paradoxically, in old cliches. The same Wordsworth, much-mocked, thought himself back to an innocent vision, told us that grass is green and water wet because he had reached beyond familiarity to some primal wonder that these things were so and not otherwise, to some mythic sense that he was giving or finding the words for the things, not merely repeating. So also Daniel, walking with Stephanie on Filey beach, had suddenly, out of some metaphorical experience as bodily as breathing, known why love was called ""sweet"" and, as his blood banged, why a beloved was a ""sweet heart"" . So now, more mildly, Frederica saw for the first time that the light was gold, that olives were black and warm, the olive trees were powdery-grey, that lavender was a purple haze. But when she saw these things written they seemed, and were, stale, deja-vu, derivative. Frederica was also enough a child of her time to suppose that what she should write should be fiction.  ""The novel is the one bright book of life,"" Lawrence had didactically exclaimed and Bill Potter had  didactically reiterated.  ""The novel is the highest form of human expression yet attained.""  If anyone had challenged Frederica directly as to whether she believed that, she would have argued the toss. But — however Wordsworthian the roots — in the 1950s the recording compulsion took Lawrentian forms. And she had no plot. Or did not recognise those plots she had. And was not primarily in those days concerned with invention. She tried to utilise Dany and his Lambretta or a speechless Michel, and disgusted herself. She was driven back to Alexander, and attempted unsuccessfully to translate that very English poet into a divinity of the olive groves. All that happened was that her sexual needs became painful instead of grumbling and Alexander became unreal in her mind in a bad way. She tried a diary, but it reiterated circuitously and boringly that Frederica Potter was bored and also, to her shame, homesick. She could not see how to see Marie-Claire and Monique, Paul-Marie and Madame, let alone the workings of the wine co-operative, the réglisserie or Protestant Nîmes. She was a good critic, despite her egocentricity, and decided briskly and miserably that writing was not her métier. So she gave up, and sat between the vines in the hot sun, alternately sleeping and working her way through the dusty volumes of Peregrine Pickle, bound in crimson and gold leather, with real bookworms making agitated forays from their dark crannies into the heat and light across the extraordinary scenes where Smollett's elderly ladies retained their urine indefinitely to put out putative fires, or sweetened their foul breaths with violet cachous to deceive desired young lovers. She did not ask herself then under what compulsion he had made his plots or constructed his worlds; she accepted them as one accepts fairy tales in childhood. And Vincent Van Gogh? Provence is as he painted it, we use his images as icons by which to recognise certain things, the cypresses above all, the olives, some configurations of rock and vegetation, the line of the Alpilles, the plain of the Crau, the light itself. He came, as Frederica did not, with precise aesthetic expectations. He expected to see ""Japanese"" subjects, the colours of Monticelli, the forms of Cezanne and Renoir, the southern light lauded by Gauguin as a mystic necessity. He saw all these things, as he expected them. He saw also Dutch things in the French heat, bridges not formally different from those in Delft and Leyden, colours in the glare that  reminded him primarily of the soft blues and yellows of Vermeer. Also, and simultaneously, he saw what no one had yet seen, what was his to see. Sunflowers, cypresses, olives. My dear Theo, I wrote to you already early this morning, then I went away to go on with a picture of a garden in the sunshine. Then I brought it back and went out again with a blank canvas and that also is finished. And now I write to you again. Because I have never had such a chance, nature here being so extraordinarily beautiful. Everywhere and all over the vault of heaven is a marvellous blue, and the sun sheds a radiance of pale sulphur, and it is soft and lovely as the combination of heavenly blues and yellows in a Van der Meer of Delft [sic]. I cannot paint it as beautifully as that, but it absorbs me so much that I let myself go, never thinking of a single rule… Here under a stronger sun, I have found what Pissarro said confirmed, and also what Gauguin wrote to me, the simplicity, the fading of the colours, the gravity of great sunlight effects. You never come near to suspecting it in the North."
FIC FIC-G01-027 -0.1 "66 ‘You were right about the killers being linked,’ said Phillip Barclay. Gregson smiled to himself. ‘But not just in the way you said,’ Barclay continued. ‘The MO's they used may have been copies of earlier killings, even this latest one. And the fact that they all burned themselves, or tried to. But there's something else, something more conclusive to link them, but it's more puzzling, too. That device — whatever the hell it is — that I found in Magee was made of the same material I found melted in the other bodies.’ ‘And I checked his fingerprints against the files on screen at Hendon,’ said Steve Houghton. ‘There's no doubt about it, the man is Trevor Magee.’ ‘And number one?’ asked Finn. ‘Going almost solely on your files and his MO, I'd have to say it was Peter Lawton,’ the Records Officer told him. Finn looked at his colleague, then at Houghton. ‘Which we know is impossible, right?’ he said, almost laughing. ‘Lawton and Bryce are banged up.’ ‘So is Magee,’ Gregson told him, flipping open the file. ‘According to this.’ He jabbed the file with his index finger. Houghton crossed to the wall behind him and flicked a switch. Panels lit up and he reached for a number of X-ray plates which he attached to the luminescent plastic. They were skull X-rays. ‘Now look. These are of Magee,’ he said. ‘Taken when they brought his body in.’ Barclay pulled a pen from his pocket and prodded part of the first plate. It showed a dark mass close to the front of the skull. On other angles it was also present. ‘See it?’ he said. ‘What is it?’ Gregson wanted to know. ‘Wait,’ Barclay told him. Houghton reached for another set of plate. The shape was far less well defined. ‘These are X-rays of Mathew Bryce's skull,’ said Barclay, ‘at least what was left of it. Unfortunately he'd been burned, but not badly enough for the bone structure to be altered as it was in Lawton's case.’ He jabbed his pen at a dark area on Bryce's X-rays too. ‘Come on, Phil, what the fuck is it?’ Finn muttered, reaching for his cigarettes but deciding not to light one when he saw the look of disapproval on the pathologist's face. ‘Both men were suffering from brain tumours,’ Barclay said. ‘How can you be sure?’ Gregson demanded. Barclay sighed. ‘It's on the plates, you can see it,’ he said, motioning to the X-rays again. ‘And, if you'd care to look at Magee, I haven't replaced the cranial cap yet and you'll see the tumour. Come down to the morgue and I'll show you.’ ‘I'll take your word for it,’ Finn said. ‘What you're saying is, these three fucking murderers we've got in cold storage have all committed crimes identical to ones committed by Peter Lawton, Mathew Bryce and Trevor Magee, right? Three blokes we know ,for sure , are locked up, doing time in Whitely nick, yeah? Now, you're trying to tell me that this is the real Trevor Magee lying downstairs? That the real Peter Lawton killed six people and then killed himself on a motorbike less than two weeks ago? That the real Mathew Bryce cut up a girl, then torched himself? And tonight the real Trevor Magee murdered a tramp and a cabbie and then smashed his car into the Centre Point fountains? You're telling me that blokes we arrested, blokes we stood in court and saw sentenced, blokes we saw driven away in fucking armoured vans, have committed the exact same crimes that they were put away for? That's what you're telling me?’ Houghton looked almost helplessly at Gregson. ‘It's bollocks,’ said Finn angrily. ‘Absolute bollocks.’ He looked at Gregson. ‘You said yourself it was impossible. If one of them had escaped from Whitely we'd have known about it, but three of the cunts? Do me a favour.’ This time he did reach for a cigarette and light it up. Silence. ‘Somebody say something, for Christ's sake,’ snarled Finn in annoyance. ‘Somebody tell me again what all this shit is supposed to mean.’ ‘Could there be a mistake with the identification?’ Gregson said. ‘It's possible with Bryce,’ Houghton admitted. ‘I found fourteen matching characteristics in the ridge patterns of his fingerprints. There should have been sixteen, but I think my figure is conclusive enough. But even if I was wrong about Bryce, it's impossible I could be wrong about Magee. His prints match those on file. His dental records match. His blood type. Everything. Unless he's got a twin identical in every way, then that man is the same one you arrested.’ Finn shook his head. ‘I don't fucking believe this,’ he said, an incredulous smile on his face. ‘It's not possible.’ ‘Then what's your explanation?’ Houghton challenged him. ‘You're telling me that you believe three convicted killers just walked out of Whitely prison without anyone noticing and now they've come back here to duplicate their original crimes? Do you believe that? Really?’ ‘I believe what I see here, Stuart, and this man is Trevor Magee,’ Houghton said quietly. ‘If it helps I'm as sceptical as you, but the evidence is here.’ ‘Evidence for what?’ Finn snarled. ‘That we're all going fucking crazy? They're inside.’ He shouted the last two words. Gregson crossed to the phone and jabbed the button. He asked the switchboard operator to connect him with Whitely Prison and waited. Finn turned to his colleague. ‘Frank, for Christ's sake…’ he began, but Gregson held up a hand to silence him. ‘Hello,’ he said finally into the phone. ‘My name is Detective Inspector Gregson. I'm calling… Yes, Gregson. ’ He spelt it out. ‘I'm calling from New Scotland Yard. I'd like to speak with the Governor please. It's very important.’ He sucked in an angry breath. ‘Yes, Gregson.’ He spelled it out again. Then he waited. The other men watched as he tapped gently on the desk top. ‘When will he back?’ he said finally. ‘Can you get him to call me as soon as possible? It's very urgent. It concerns three of the inmates there.’ They saw Gregson's features harden. ‘Who are you, anyway?’ He sighed. ‘All right, perhaps you can help me. Their names are Peter Lawton, Mathew Bryce and Trevor Magee. I need to speak to Governor Nicholson about them as soon as possible, do you understand?’ The other three saw a flicker on the DI's face. ‘Say that again?’ He looked across Finn, a look of bewilderment on his face. He shook his head slowly. ‘Can you tell me when?’ ‘What the fuck is this?’ Finn whispered, still watching his superior. ‘Thank you,’ said Gregson. ‘Tell Governor Nicholson to ring me on this number as soon as possible.’ Gregson put down the phone. ‘Well?’ said Finn. The DI looked at Houghton. ‘Are you sure that's Trevor Magee?’ he said, the knot of muscles at the side of his jaw pulsing. Houghton held up his hands. ‘Frank, for God's sake,’ he sighed. ‘If I had children I'd swear on their graves. It is Magee. There's no question of it.’ ‘And you're sure about the others as well?’ Houghton nodded. ‘According to that guy I just spoke to,’ said Gregson  quietly, ‘Trevor Magee died six months ago. As a matter of fact he's buried in the same piece of ground as Peter Lawton and Mathew Bryce. They never left Whitely. All three of them are buried there.’"
FIC FIC-G0Y-002 -0.14 "6 ‘I been having a little think,’ said Ron Paget. ‘About your patch of waste ground.’ Edward and Helen gazed at him without expression, a practised process. They were all three standing in the lane outside Greystones. Ron had pounced from his car, screeching to a halt ten yards ahead of them. He had opened with a solicitous enquiry as to whether young Gary was giving satisfaction. ‘I mean,’ he continued, ‘it's a bit of an albatross, isn't it? The upkeep and that. What I was thinking was…’ ‘We don't keep it up,’ said Edward. ‘It keeps itself up.’ Ron shook his head censoriously. ‘That's just the point, Mr Glover, if I may say so. There's a lot of work needs doing in there. You've got dead and diseased trees need felling, you've got bramble and stuff needs clearing out. It's not healthy, the way it is. But with a bit of money spent you could have a nice little spinney there — be pretty in the spring. You could do a bit of landscape planting, azaleas and rhododendrons and that, camellias maybe — you know, like your National Trust sort of place.’ ‘Those things don't grow on limestone soil,’ said Helen. Ron opened his mouth and then closed it again. Behind him the engine of his new red Rover was still running — a barely audible hum. Ron stepped aside, opened the door and turned the ignition. ‘Point is, to do something about the place you need finance, right? I know what it's like these days — we're all stretched as far as we can go’— he sighed —‘but I've had a little think and I see a way round it for you. Now you've got quite an area there — two acres, is it, two and a half? What you do is you make one half of it finance the other. You do a little development on the far side — three, four nice houses, something along those  lines. I can see to all the nitty-gritty for you — I know you're not a family for bothering your heads with that sort of thing, you've got better things to do. I can handle it for you and see you clear enough to lay yourselves out something really nice with what's left, really classy bit of landscaping. And a fair bit left over to put away for a rainy day, I daresay.’ ‘No,’ said Edward. Ron looked sadly at him. ‘You're saying that off the top of your head, Mr Glover. Think it over. There's the question of what's good for the community, too. You'd be doing the community a favour. Desperate shortage of housing these days.’ ‘Was it council houses you had in mind?’ asked Helen. ‘Well, no,’ said Ron. ‘I mean, what's needed in the village is more by way of quality housing, isn't it? Another nice little executive estate, like the Barratt.’ ‘I don't see that as fulfilling a social need,’ said Helen. Ron gave her a bad-tempered look. There was a sense of time and patience running out. He opened the car door and got in. The engine purred again. The driver's window slid down; ‘Well, think about it, anyway. It would be in your own best interests, believe me.’ The Rover accelerated round the bend. Edward, who had seemed despondent hitherto that morning, laughed. ‘You have to hand it to him, he's never short of a new idea.’ They were on their way to the churchyard. The firm from whom the gravestone had been commissioned had telephoned about dimensions and other details. Having reached the initial, simple decision about lettering (plain, unadorned and to the point) and material (unpolished limestone slab) they were now floored over questions of layout and surroundings. Did they want chippings? Did they want a flower container? They walked slowly up the church path, past the old graves, those so seared by time and weather that they stood as grey shapes furred with lichen, names and dates no longer legible, uniform in obscurity. Where the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gave way to the nineteenth, things became crisper: you read of a profusion of Elizas and Thomases, of beloved wives and lamented parents: white marble crept in with the grey limestone. It was round the back of the church, though, where the more recent graves reached away to an expectant area of bare grass ending at the village allotments, that variety and self-expression were rampant. ‘I realise what chippings are now,’ said Edward. ‘No. Definitely not.’ Most of the newer gravestones presided over a neat granite-edged rectangle packed with green crystal chips. The effect, from a distance, was disconcertingly like a series of little swimming-pools. Closer to, memorial detail became apparent: elaborate confections in the form of open books inscribed with the particulars of the departed, weeping cherubs and angels, praying heads and exuberant crosses. It disposed entirely of any notion of the rural midland English as a phlegmatic and undemonstrative lot. Many of the graves had flowers on them — wilting asters and marigolds in jam-jars, or vases of plastic roses and daffodils in luminous colours. One unkempt mound bore a glass with a Harp Lager insignia, filled with greenish water. Edward and Helen approached the sycamore tree and stood before the raw earth of Dorothy's grave. In the month since the funeral, infant weeds had sprung up, and some blades of grass. ‘No chippings,’ said Edward. ‘No thing for vase. I'm not even sure about this kerbstone business.’ ‘You can have granite chips, but they're almost as bad. Just grass, then?’ ‘Just grass, yes. It would be nice to try to naturalise some fritillaries. Or those small grassland orchids — Lady's Tresses.’ ‘Oh, Edward,’ said Helen with a sigh. ‘Just a thought.’ They stood there uncomfortably. Both had a fleeting vision of what lay beneath the mound of earth: the varnished wood, the brass handles, their mother. Edward, fighting the thought, imagined decay; Helen remembered the posy of flowers from the garden that she had tried to fix to the coffin lid with sellotape. Sellotape will not stick to varnish, she had discovered; she ended up with hammer and tintacks, shrinking at the unseemly noise and violence. The flowers would be withered now, down there. Both recalled the funeral, calculated time: a month, already, when we have been without her. Both examined their feelings. I am adjusting, thought Helen, I am stepping aside. But funny things are happening. In some way she is more here than she ever was. It is as though she had not died but been transformed. Edward thought: It is as though I were adrift, untethered. I don't think of her much, no more than I ever did, but something terrible is going on. At moments all is well, and then at others I think that I am flying apart. Helen took a tape-measure out of her pocket and suspended it above the grave. ‘That height? Or a bit more? They want to know.’ ‘It doesn't matter,’ said Edward. ‘Two foot six, then. And just ‘Dorothy Edith Glover: April 10th 1907–May 24th 1987’. They seem to feel it's a bit stark.’ ‘It is. Compared with everyone else.’ Edward looked around. Deeply lamented. In loving memory. Pray for the soul of… R.l.P. Helen rolled up the tape-measure and pushed it into her pocket. ‘Well, I shall just have to be firm, then. They obviously think it most inadequate.’ They turned and walked back towards the lych-gate. ‘Presumably,’ said Edward, ‘they take it to mean we weren't all that fond of her.’ ‘Or else that we're hard up. More lettering costs more. Polished granite is more expensive than limestone. The angels and open books and things cost a packet — I looked at the brochure.’ It was Saturday morning, which meant that the village was fairly populous; on weekdays it was emptied of all but the old, the very young and those tending them. The central green had cars scattered all around it. Ron Paget's Rover stood outside the Swan, the more plushy of the two pubs. A sinister looking cluster of motor-bikes huddled in front of the other one, the Goat and Compasses; as the Glovers passed two more arrived with a deafening roar and two androgynous figures, clad in skin-tight leather as though for a bout of deep-sea diving, went into the  pub, stripping off immense gauntlets. From within came the crash of reggae music. A BP oil tanker was blocking the narrow lane down to the Old Forge, towering over the thatched cottage to which it was attached by its pipe-line as though with an umbilical cord. Beyond, the post van hooted indignantly. An old man sat on the bench by the War Memorial. From the gravelled sweep of the entrance to the Old Rectory came Mrs Hadley on a gleaming chestnut horse; she clattered past the Glovers, the old man, other passers-by with the age-old superiority of the mounted over those on foot. A car slowed down to pass her and she raised her crop graciously. ‘We need something for lunch,’ said Helen. ‘And dog food. And cereal.’ And detergent, she added to herself. ‘You may as well stay outside, there's an awful crowd in there.’ She stood in a queue at the single check-out; the village store had supermarket aspirations without the amenities. Two young women in front of her were murmuring confidentially. One said ‘I gather Brown Owl has resigned…’ It took Helen a moment or two to realise the affairs of the village Brownie pack were under discussion. She looked over their heads and caught the eye of an acquaintance, who smiled faintly and dipped away in embarrassment, observing the quarantine imposed upon those recently bereaved. There we go again, she thought, mother is still here, still making herself felt. She paid for her purchases, tucking the detergent under the other things. Outside, she found Edward in conversation with Peter Sidey, the leader of the preservationist element in the village. The preservationists, over the years, had lost ground — quite literally. They tended to be schoolteachers, academics and the recently retired; against them were ranged builders, farmers and most of those who, by luck or good management, owned a half acre or derelict cottage ripe for profitable transformation. Such people were adept at the manipulation of planning committees, the lobbying of local government officers. The preservationists, pinning their faith to moral superiority and persuasive argument, were beaten back every time. The cause at issue right now was the planning application for half a dozen houses in the orchard attached to a cottage in the  centre of the village, the property of a local farmer. The farmer, himself a member of the planning committee, had recently removed his stockman from the cottage had built him a modern bungalow on the farm, an arrangement now recognised as less altruistic than it might appear. Peter Sidey was explaining all this to Edward. Edward, Helen could see from his stance, was bored: he had his head tilted on one side and was watching a bird in a tree behind Peter Sidey's left ear. People believed that Edward, as an ardent nature conservationist, must be similarly passionate about all environmental matters. This was not so. He found it difficult to get worked up about buildings and tended to think of landscapes as habitats rather than objects of aesthetic concern. ‘Clegg will make about a hundred thousand,’ said Peter Sidey, ‘if his application goes through. And the village will lose its last open space. I've seen the plans for the houses and they're peculiarly insensitive — more suitable for Milton Keynes.’ He was a retired architect, past seventy now, who had exhausted himself over mainly fruitless endeavours to obstruct the likes of this opportunist farmer. He would have had a much more tranquil retirement, Helen thought, in some already brutalised corner of the country. The Glovers made appropriate noises of concern. Peter Sidey outlined the opposition plans and urged them to write letters and attend a protest meeting. ‘If that piece of land is developed there will be no large open space left in the village except the Green itself. And of course the Britches, thanks to your mother's public-spirited stand over the years. By the way, had you ever realised the name is Saxon by origin? From braec — a word meaning land newly taken into cultivation.’ ‘Well, it's the opposite now,’ said Edward. ‘Extremely uncultivated.’ ‘Quite. Interesting, though — the indestructibility of a name.’ Helen and Edward broke away as soon as was decently possible. They were both tickled at the image of Dorothy as a defender of the public good. ‘Perhaps we should have told him she spent twenty years not selling the Britches simply to annoy the people who wanted to buy it,’ said Edward. ‘Certainly not. The result remains the same, whatever her reasons.’ As they approached the front door of Greystones Helen heard the telephone ringing within. She felt a rush of excitement and anticipation, and realised that in the preoccupations of the last half hour she had not thought of Giles Carnaby once — definitely a record. Fumbling with the latch key, she rushed for the telephone, thrusting the shopping basket at Edward. It was Joyce Babcock. Reminding her at length, in case she hadn't made a note of it, of the Christmas holiday schedule for the library. When at last she put the receiver down and went into the kitchen she found that Edward had unpacked the shopping. The bottle of detergent stood in reproachful isolation at one end of the table. Thinking of Giles Carnaby, of course, was not so much a considered process as an involuntary twitch. She did not want to think of him but could not help it. Indeed he was there most of the time, presiding within her head, dimming a little when her attention was engaged, all-pervasive in times of relaxation. At night he filled the room. She heard again every word he had spoken; she reconstructed his face, his body, his clothes. A man she had met three times. With whom she had spent six hours or so. Who had displayed a friendly interest in her. She saw herself, and did not care for what she saw. She stood to one side and observed this pathetic self-deluding fifty-two-year-old in a state of romantic yearning and sexual excitation. Given to the observation of others, she now observed herself, but without charity. She agreed with her mother: riding for a fall, driving nails in her own coffin, only herself to blame. And there was nothing, absolutely nothing, to be done. Edward, offended by the detergent, wandered out into the garden and was instantly distracted by the sound of digging from beyond the yew hedge. Rather desultory digging. Of course that boy was here. He went to the gap in the hedge and saw  Gary at the far end of the kitchen garden. He was not digging at all now but taking a breather, evidently. A prolonged breather, during which he took a bar of chocolate out of his pocket and unwrapped it in a leisurely way. Edward stood there. Gary half-turned, spotted him out of the corner of one eye and began to dig again with great fervour. Edward continued to stand there for another minute or two. Then he plunged off into the Britches to check the nest-boxes. ‘He what ?’ exploded Louise. ‘A row with the headmistress about evolution ? Only Edward could have a row about evolution.’ ‘On the contrary,’ said Helen. ‘It was the stock subject for argument in the late nineteenth century, in some circles.’ ‘Oh,then … Trust Edward. I wish he had resigned — it would have been hilarious. So what else is new?’ Helen reached out for Edward's anorak, lying on the oak chest, and put it round her shoulders. She wished, not for the first time, that the telephone was not in the hall, always the coldest place in the house. The telephone was in the hall because Dorothy had said that telephones had to be in halls; it occurred to Helen that there was no longer any reason for this to be so. In one moment of combined panic and acceptance she knew that the telephone would stay exactly where it was. ‘I've ordered the memorial stone.’ ‘The what ?’ ‘Gravestone. Sorry — it's what the brochures say.’ She described the choice. ‘Do you think that sounds all right?’ ‘I suppose so. God! What a thing to have to do. I'm sorry everything gets shoved on to you.’ ‘Edward helped.’ ‘Well, good. But now I'm feeling guilty. I ought to be there. Actually life has been fairly murderous lately. The office. And Tim has been having a go of his sinus plus conjunctivitis and something else he describes as angst and is being generally unsupportive. And Phil is playing up. Actually I think I may come down this weekend, just to escape. So…anything else?’ Helen put the anorak on. ‘Ron Paget tried to get us to build on the Britches again.’ Louise laughed. ‘Tell him Edward's turning it into a conservation area for endangered species. Actually, Ron doesn't know it, but he's got a point — you really ought to think about money a bit. Tim wants you to see some people he knows who do investment advice — then you'd get more out of those shares. Apparently they're all in the wrong things.’ ‘We don't want…’ Helen began. ‘Don't be silly. Tim's going to fix it up. You can have a nice day out in London — do you good.’ ‘We don't…’ But Louise was off on another track. Helen stared at the oak chest and wondered what was in it. She couldn't remember anyone having opened it in years. There was a torn squab cushion on the top and it was traditionally used as a place to dump coats, scarves and gloves. Helen thought she could distantly recall having seen it open with her mother upended over it, rummaging. It had been Dorothy's territory, as indeed had all of the house, except for areas of communal use. It occurred to Helen — listening to Louise, contemplating the chest — that in all the years she and Edward had lived at Greystones they had fully occupied only their own bedrooms; elsewhere, they perched. As soon as Louise had rung off she removed the cushion and opened the chest. The contents reeked of damp. On top was a rug, colourless with age and stained with mildew. Helen picked it out and dropped it on the floor; beneath was a tangle of string. So that was where mother had kept all that string from parcels which must not be discarded lest it be needed. There was a stack of crumpled brown paper, some of it addressed to herself and to Edward or Louise and bearing injunctions about not opening before Christmas; she recognised the handwriting of aunts and godmothers. Beneath the layer of string and paper was a foetid mass of material: old curtains and cushions, felted blankets, a porridge of gloves and belts, garments decayed almost beyond identification. Moth and mouse had thrived down here. Helen reached in and stirred with distaste; a brown knitted pixie hat surfaced that her  mother used to wear long ago, unravelled now to a skeletal condition. She spotted a sweater she once gave Edward for a birthday, and various throw-outs of her own. She remembered her mother, standing squarely at the front door, fending off supplicants from the village school Parent-Teacher Association, the Darby and Joan Club, the summer Fete; Greystones never had jumble. Had her mother harboured some primitive superstition about the totemistic quality of one's possessions? Rejected the thought of her things in other hands? She poked again — dug right down to the bottom and up through the shambles came something that signalled with painful clarity. Honey-coloured muslin. Mousseline de soie , to be precise; a grandeur of definition that she had cherished, aged eighteen. Faded now to dirty cream, and thrust down in a crumpled ball to the base of the chest — but still instantly known. That dress. She pulled it up and shook it out. There it was — complete with the taffeta underskirt that had once (once only) rustled so satisfyingly. She sat down and examined it minutely — spread it over her lap and investigated. It was undamaged; creased into a wrinkled network, yes — its honey glow extinguished — a poor drab thing but unstained, untorn, unshrunk. She smoothed the dress across her knees and pondered this. The cupboard in which it was not. The moment of surprise, of faint alarm. The rail of intimately known clothes — her two tweed skirts, her three cotton frocks, her winter coat, her wool pinafore dress. And an airy space at the end where should have hung, in all its glory, the honey-coloured muslin — her first and only evening dress, the amazing, unexpected, enhancing present from her godmother. ‘Mother! My evening dress isn't in my cupboard!’ Dorothy's back view, squat and priest-like before the altar of the kitchen stove. Stirring a pan, her head wreathed in steam, hairpins jutting from the bun at the nape of her neck. ‘Mother!’ ‘I heard you. No need to shout. That dress went to the cleaners.’ ‘But mother … It didn't need cleaning. I've only worn it once. And I need it for Saturday — for the Clarks’ dance.’ ‘It had perspiration marks.’ ‘Oh mother, it didn't… Never mind, I'll go and get it. It will be ready, won't it? Where's the ticket, I…’ And Dorothy turns, red-faced from her brew, or so it seemed. ‘They had some disaster with it, apparently. No point in going round there. It was spoiled. The stuff they use — these chemicals.’ And turns again to the stove, furiously stirring. ‘No! Oh no… Oh,mother … But then I've nothing for Saturday. Nothing at all.’ ‘Nonsense,’ says Dorothy. ‘I'll take in my old brown silk for you. There's a good hem on it, too, it can be let down. That'll be perfectly all right— Rose was out of her mind buying you that ridiculous creation anyway, far too low cut and tight in the bust.’ And what, one now wonders, happened to the brown silk, of which there is no sign — neither here in the chest nor upstairs among mother's things. It is all too well remembered: the slimy feel of it, hanging limp and unfitting around her as she stands awkward on the threshold of the Clarks' drawing-room, where the carpets are rolled back, the parquet gleams and in the corner the big hired radiogram is asserting that the lady is a tramp. She prays to be noticed; she prays to be ignored. Gone is the rapturous unfamiliar feeling of equality, of authority, induced by the mousseline de soie at her cousins' dance two weeks before. She does not look nice; she knows that she does not look nice. A few yards of material have changed her from one person into another. Is one's grip of things to be always so fickle? ‘I've emptied the hall chest. I thought you might use it for your files.’ ‘I didn't know there was anything in it,’ said Edward. ‘It was bung full.’ ‘Stuff of mother's, I imagine.’ ‘Not entirely. There was a dress I had when I was eighteen.’ Edward looked at Helen warily, alerted by her tone. ‘A dress mother said the cleaners ruined. Not the case, it now seems.’ Edward, shying away from disagreeable exposures, supposed that mother must have made a mistake. ‘Mother didn't make that kind of mistake.’ ‘So long ago,’ murmured Edward, sidestepping. ‘I don't know how you can remember…’ ‘Since when,’ said Helen, ‘does one forget?’ He remembered now, though would not have done so otherwise. He left Helen and went to have a bath and in the cold steamy bathroom there came to him this vision of a distant unreal Helen looking — well, radiant was the unexpected word that came to mind — looking not her usual self at all in some frock that glowed and billowed and rustled as she came in at the front door late, pink-cheeked, a touch dishevelled and greeted by the stone wall of Dorothy's disapproval. Where had he been then? Lurking on the stairs; listening from his bed? Edward lay in the bath as the water cooled around him — as usual it had never been adequately hot — and allowed physical discomfort to complement his state of mind. He thought of Helen, with distress and in helplessness. He did not know quite what was implied by all this business of dresses, but he sensed something ugly — and flinched. His mother trundled around on the edges of his thoughts and he tried to push her away. She came back, unquenchable and impervious. ‘When he was very small Helen had been all that he was not; wise, mature, equipped with skills and resources. He sheltered under her wing; above all, he sheltered from their mother. And then had come the awful perception that Helen too was vulnerable; he had seen her exposed, humiliated, disappointed. He had realised that the refinement of distress is that you are obliged to suffer not just for yourself, which is the easier part, but for others as well. He suffered for Helen, and suffered again now in retrospect in the chill bathwater in the dank Greystones bathroom where condensation sent rusty trails from the pipes  down every wall. He thought of Helen, and felt for Helen, as some wincing extension of himself. If anyone had asked him God forbid — what were his feelings for his sister he would have replied that he was fond of her. When Edward was about twenty he had once intercepted the look exchanged by a young married couple. He could no longer remember who they were, but their faces were with him still, and that look: those two pairs of eyes, from which shone a brilliant collusive intensity — an intensity that excluded the rest of the world. On that occasion he was awed and intrigued; he hoped and expected that one day he too would share such a look with someone. Subsequently, he came across the look on various faces — a mother lifting a baby from a pram, a child running towards its father, a woman sitting beside a hospital bed, lovers by the dozen. Awe gave way to a certain bleakness; he felt the excluding quality of those eyes — they were never looking at him. The only eyes that ever gazed thus into his were those of a succession of dogs. Nor did he ever so gaze himself. At the only time in his life when he would have liked to he was so crushed by doubt and diffidence that he kept his eyes scrupulously trained upon the ground, or the table in front of him, or the wall behind the shoulder of the person concerned. Whole conversations took place during which Edward stared out of windows, or at carpets or pavements or the branches of trees. ‘Do you realise that you have this exasperating habit of never looking at one, Edward?’ Oh yes. Only surreptitiously, when unobserved — soaking up, then, the tilt of the jaw, the structure of the hairline, the wonderful singularity of nose, of mouth, of eyebrow. ‘Edward, are you with me or are you not? I sometimes wonder.’ Only too much so, alas. Only too much so. Those times were reduced now to a swirl of unchronological slides — images of a room, a street, a skyline — some with accompanying sound. A tube train. Circle Line. Paddington, Bayswater, Notting  Hill… An advertisement about Amplex: two people staring in distaste at an unsuspecting third. ‘Well, Edward — what about this Italian trip… Would it be fun?’ And the whole scene becomes incandescent: the cheerful rocking train, the interesting faces of people, promise and potential. The Chinese restaurant. Waiting; alone. Watching the door. Through which, at last, comes the expected face and with it another, known also, and the evening is dashed, the stomach twists, the chop suey smells sour. Greenwich Park. The perfect ginger circles of autumn leaves beneath the trees. A tug hooting from the river. Sparrows at their feet. His own hand reaching out in despair to touch another, which is instantly withdrawn. ‘Sorry, Edward…’ Trudging from one grey day into another, on and on, until at last it doesn't matter any more, or so it seems."
FIC FIC-G0Y-008 -0.02 "12 I suppose, Helen thought, that the interesting thing about my condition is the loss of self-control. Eventually one will see this as interesting rather than demoralising. It will be possible to look back and observe that those in love become utterly self-destructive. Oneself in love. At the moment I can no longer act with common sense and deliberation, because there is only one course open, and that is determined by obsession. I am obsessed by Giles; all I can think of is whether I shall see him again, and when. What the outcome of seeing him might be is beside the point; I have become incapable of calculation. Normally behaviour — or at least my behaviour — is governed by certain processes; weighing one course of action against another, thinking about consequences. In this predicament, one does nothing of the kind. One responds to some basic drive, like an animal. In youth, I found this exhilarating, I remember. She tried, as therapy, to recall previous experiences. She was probably, she realised, shorter on this than most people. Apart from that early sexual encounter, which did not count as love, there had been Peter Datchett and two others. With Peter Datchett, it had been a question of ripening interest rather than obsession. The others, in so far as she could recover her feelings of the time, seemed to have involved love — inflammation of the senses, certainly. At eighteen — the period of the mousseline de soie dress — she had found herself hanging around a certain area of Twickenham, where they were then living, in the hopes of encountering the doctor's son, with whom she had had a strangled conversation at some social gathering. He had subsequently taken her to the cinema, where she had been startled to feel his hand creep into hers. Four weeks later she had seen him in the  cinema queue with another girl, and had perceived that her day was over; in between, she had known disorientation and obsession, diagnosed her trouble, and felt exhilarated. Later, in her twenties, she had become quietly and patiently infatuated with a married colleague. The man had never behaved towards her in other than a friendly and decorous way; nevertheless, she burned. When after a year he moved away to another job, she felt acute distress and thought continuously of him for many months. It was that experience, in recollection, which most closely reflected her present state. Late one afternoon Giles came into the library. Helen had taken over the ‘Returned Books’ counter temporarily from one of the juniors and looked up to find him standing in front of her, smiling. He held up empty hands. ‘I'm not a customer. Nothing to declare. But I did have something in mind — a biography of Mahler.’ ‘We have Donald Mitchell. I'm not sure if it's on the shelf. You'll find it in…’ ‘I'd hoped for personal service,’ said Giles. Helen glanced round. ‘When Janice comes back from her tea I can hand over here.’ ‘Good. I'll fend for myself till then.’ Five minutes later she joined him in the Biography alcove. ‘I'm sorry I was out when you phoned — Edward did remember to tell me this time.’ ‘Did I phone? Yes, so I did — this week has been hectic, though not in any interesting way. Nothing to report on your mother's affairs, I'm afraid. Now — what do you advise? Mahler is out. Shall I embark on two volumes of Henry James?’ They discussed books for a few minutes. Giles made his selection. He glanced at his watch. ‘I must be off. Choir night, so I get myself an early supper. Thank you for your invaluable help — what luck to find you. I was afraid I might have struck one of the days you aren't here.’ There was to be no arrangement made, then. Choir night. Helen thought of the dark woman; in the mind's eye she saw her — laughing and talking with Giles. She felt a gust of despair. For  a moment she was quite faint; the library rocked around her — the browsing readers with shopping baskets set down beside them, the books in their bright rows, the humming strip lights. She took a deep breath, gathered herself, the room settled; Giles was tucking his pile of books under his arm, picking up his briefcase. She said, ‘Then what were you telephoning about?’ ‘About?’ He looked at her in surprise. And something else: something chilly, something that warned. Stop, she told herself, stop. And continued. ‘If there's nothing to report…’ ‘Oh,’ said Giles. ‘Yes… Let me see now, what did I have in mind? Mahler, perhaps. And to say thank you for that lovely picnic. I was telling Edward about the heron we saw.’ He was about to go; he turned to her. Well — goodbye, my dear, he was about to say, so glad I found you. And would be gone, leaving her to stare into blank days ahead. No, she thought, no. ‘I should like to see you,’ she said. ‘Helen… Of course.’ He laid a hand on her arm, placating. ‘Very soon. It's difficult to talk here, isn't it? And I have the blessed choir. We must organise something — very soon.’ ‘And you've given me the impression you wanted to see me, too.’ Appalled, she heard herself forge on. ‘But my dear…’ A woman edged past them into the alcove, murmuring apologies. Giles continued, his voice losing its solicitous intimacy. ‘We must talk again. Soon. Definitely. And thank you again for your help.’ He smiled: a public, neutral smile. The woman looked at them for a moment over the book she had pulled from the shelf. He went. ‘I can never find R to Z,’ said the woman plaintively. ‘Something funny happens after P.’ Helen supplied assistance. She could hardly hear the woman's queries; her stomach twisted; his bland little words ticked in her head — soon, very soon. Well, said her mother, I should think you may have gone and done it now. She was having dreams of unabashed sexuality. It was not Giles, though, who featured in these dreams. She consorted, these  nights, with strangers — men who were temporarily vivid when she awoke but who faded as the day progressed until, after a few hours, they vanished entirely. Since the picnic, the young man by the river had joined her twice; she herself, interestingly, had not been the Helen of today but her own younger self and indeed not even that — some other girl who was both alien and deeply familiar, a doppelgänger , a mirror-Helen. She had bathed naked from a deserted beach with this man, and lain with him afterwards among sand-dunes. In the morning, while the dream remained with her, she felt searingly deprived, as though she had been abandoned, as though she had lost someone known and loved. And the loss was in part the loss of some aspect of herself, as irretrievable as past happiness. She remembered that somewhere Dorothy had kept old photograph albums and, on a whim, began to search for them. They were not where she had expected to find them, in the big tallboy in the sitting room, in which lurked an unvisited confusion of old magazines, moth-eaten balls of knitting-wool, paper patterns, Edward's school reports, Louise's sketch pads, buttons, string. She ran them to ground eventually in the bottom of Dorothy's wardrobe, an area she had not yet steeled herself to clear. Pulling them from under some old blankets, she sat down on the bed and began to leaf through the pages: photographs fell out, battered, uncherished, not stuck-in — this was no lovingly tended relic. Here was a curly-haired Louise, smirking in a sunsuit on a grey, shingly beach; here was Edward in knee-length shorts, hair clipped to his scalp and ears sticking out. And here was Helen, a forgotten Helen with anxious chubby adolescent face, wearing a crumpled cotton dress and tilted sideways — her mother had been a careless photographer. All these prints, indeed, were under- or over-exposed, with their subjects askew; heads were chopped off, feet and hands loomed giant in the foregrounds. Nevertheless, photographs had been taken; there had been a deliberate attempt to record, to retain. Helen, shuffling through them, remembered Louise in the churchyard: even mother must have had the odd twinge… Here was her father, too. Always on the edge of things. He stood diffidently to the side of a group, or featured as a  background — the pair of legs clutched by baby Louise, a blurred figure in a field beyond Helen and Edward who sat on a rug eating sandwiches. That particular snap prompted the memory, the afternoon returning as she stared at it — the sandwiches had been of marmite, Edward had found a hawk-moth caterpillar. But what was their father doing, lurking indistinctly over there under a tree? That Helen could not remember. And nowhere did he appear alone: never, it seemed, had Dorothy turned the viewfinder of the old box Brownie deliberately upon her husband. Equally, she was absent herself; naturally enough — she had been the photographer. At the back of the album was a clutch of glossy professional pictures, and in these Dorothy could be found, glaring out from Louise's wedding group, standing rigid beside Edward on his graduation day. For both occasions she had worn the same hat — an uncompromising chenille turban; Helen had disposed of it a month ago with the rest of her things and, as she looked at the photographs, felt again the curious dry but slimy touch of it. And there also, in an earlier picture, was the brown bear fur coat: Dorothy, flanked by Helen and Edward as children, stood on a pavement against a background of London taxis and buses — they must have been caught by a street photographer on one of those pantomime or ballet outings. Dorothy looked determined rather than festive; she would have been in her forties at the time but already stood as though planted, like an elderly woman. She had never seemed young, Helen realised; not even in the haziest reaches of recollection. But it was not for Dorothy that she searched, nor even for her father. She hunted herself, putting aside all those pictures in which she appeared — not as child but as a grown woman. There were not so many. The sequence ended abruptly in the late fifties; the camera had packed up. Helen could even remember the occasion; the shutter jamming, her mother's fit of temper, the thing flung into the dustbin. And never, of course, replaced; such a purchase would have been an unjustifiable extravagance. The last photograph of herself showed her at about twenty-five, here in the garden at Greystones, sorting apples into baskets. Clearly Dorothy's principal intention had been to record the apple harvest — a prodigious one; Helen's presence was incidental, like one of those figures introduced for purposes of scale or composition. But she had turned her face to the camera and it had caught a look that she could find nowhere else and indeed that seemed to belong to another girl; she barely recognised herself. She saw a person who was young, yes, but — more than that — who wore an expression of arresting vivacity and expectancy. And who looked thus at her mother — what had she seen? Of what had she been thinking? Helen turned the picture over and saw that Dorothy had pencilled on the back ‘18 lbs Laxtons; 27 lbs Coxes.’ One of those trees had blown over in a storm a few years later; the other survived as a diseased and sterile relic. She sat on her mother's bed and studied her own distant and alien face. The eyes, indeed, met hers — alive, expectant, vulnerable. She felt as though confronted by a child: it'll be all right, she wanted to say, I'll see that it's all right. A letter came from Giles: a typed, official letter concerning her mother's affairs. But folded within it was a handwritten note ‘So good to see you at the library, albeit briefly. Though I thought you seemed not quite yourself, and trust all is well now — do let me know if there is anything I can do. Yours affec. Giles.’ What am I supposed to make of this? she wondered. And with the thought came a spurt of irritation. I am supposed to make anything, or nothing, of it; obscurity and ambiguity are built in, whether deliberately or because that is his habit. Just as he has behaved since we met in a manner that avoids interpretation. She telephoned that evening, before she could change her mind. She picked up the receiver without planning what she would say. ‘This is Helen.’ There was no hesitation, no coolness to his voice. ‘How nice and how are you? You've had my letter? As I explained — we should be able to get those shares transferred next month, and then you can go ahead and sell them, or re-invest or whatever you wish. It might be as well to…’ ‘I understand,’ she said. ‘And thank you for your note.’ ‘Ah…’ ‘There is, in a sense, something you can do. Perhaps we could meet.’ Giles said at once, ‘Of course . Let's see… Tomorrow? What about tomorrow — Saturday? I am bespoke in the evening, but the daytime is free, once I've done my domestic chores. Why don't we have a pub lunch and a breath of fresh air somewhere pleasant?’ He had suggested the landscaped grounds of an eighteenth-century house, noted for their expression of the picturesque: ‘I'm not a great one for stately homes, but you can have a good walk there.’ They had lunched in a crowded riverside pub, where Giles had talked smoothly and continuously on a general level. He continued to talk thus now, as they walked down the grand vista, away from the formal gardens and into the woodland rides, where classical figures loomed from the undergrowth and the serpentine rill wound away towards a distant temple. They stopped at the balustraded terrace overlooking the small lake, and leaned over; below, enormous golden fish lay around in the green water. ‘Carp?’ wondered Giles. ‘Or orfe, are they? There's something called an orfe, isn't there?’ Helen said, ‘I think I should find myself another solicitor.’ She had not considered the words; they arrived, simply, and once said, seemed right. He turned to her. She saw him, for the first time ever, startled. There was a sudden nakedness to his face. Then the nakedness was covered: he had seen what lay ahead. He said, with deliberate care, ‘But of course, my dear, if you feel we are not coming up to scratch. You have a perfect right.’ ‘It's nothing to do with professional things. It's because I am in love with you.’ There was a silence. ‘Oh dear, oh dear,’ said Giles. He sounded entirely artificial. He looked down at the fish. ‘My dear Helen…’ ‘Which is my fault,’ said Helen. ‘But it makes life difficult. And I have to say that although what I feel is my fault, and my responsibility, you have, up to a point, encouraged me. Or at least you have left me not knowing what to think.’ Giles sighed. ‘Then I am to blame. Please let me say, Helen, that I have the very greatest affection and respect for you. Please realise that. I value your friendship enormously, and I'd hoped to continue to do so.’ She watched the fish. Carp, or orfe. They lay at angles to each other, drifting very slowly so that the gold-splintered pattern of the lake changed continuously. She heard what he said and she thought, so that is how it is, and how it is going to be. She felt nothing very much, except the sense of moving inexorably from one moment to the next, and accepting what each brought. She followed the slow gyration of one very large, cream-coloured fish and said, ‘But you aren't in love with me, which would make it, I'm afraid, an awkward friendship. Of course, my feelings may change — I'm well aware of that — in which case all this will seem rather silly. I'll probably wish I'd never mentioned the matter, but it seems necessary to me at the moment, so there it is. What isn't very important to you has become important to me — disturbingly important. There is an imbalance, and I feel that I can't allow it to go on. For my own sake, I suppose.’ It was surprising how easily the words came, now that she had allowed them. She did not look at Giles at all as she spoke and the sentences piled one upon another, without restraint, like a flow of thought; there was even a low level of enjoyment in the sense of release. ‘Another woman would cope with this differently, I daresay. You have appeared at a time when things are rather…odd. For me, I mean. Maybe that's partly why I've reacted like this. I'm conscious of not abiding by rules, in saying all this. You'd much prefer that I didn't.’ She caught, out of the corner of her eye, his gesture of disagreement. He started to speak but she interrupted. ‘Don't think, though, that I am dishing out blame. The problem is — has been — that what was one thing to you was quite another to me. Probably I misinterpreted, from time to time. Thought you meant things you didn't mean.’ She paused, and Giles leapt in at once. ‘I am at fault. The  trouble is…my trouble is… Oh dear. I'm susceptible, I suppose. Even now I'm finding your honesty charming. Does this really have to end our friendship? Surely not. As you rightly say, your feelings may change. Oh — will change, certainly.’ Was there an edge of doubt or complacency to his tone? ‘I don't really think,’ said Helen, ‘that either of us would feel very comfortable after this.’ Giles sighed. ‘You're so much nicer than I am, Helen. You make me seem insincere. But I'm not, you know. I'm just…well, I meet someone like you with whom I feel instant affinity, to whom I'm instantly attracted and… I get carried away, I suppose. It isn't insincerity. It's…susceptibility. A weakness, I suppose, but there we are.’ He turned on her a rueful expression — rueful but placating, like a boy caught out in a misdemeanour. She was to be wrong-footed, she saw: made to feel ponderous, portentous. ‘I never saw you as insincere. Merely perplexing, at times. At least perplexing to me, but that is probably to do with my own shortcomings. In relationships, that is. That's what I mean by things being different for you than for me.’ She was watching the fish again. And now she caught him in another gesture, but a surreptitious one this time — the quick shooting of a cuff to glance at his watch. At some other level of consciousness she registered amazement, a flick of anger, and the distant recognition of her own recovery: eventually, she would remember that movement. A pair of collared doves were moaning in the trees overhead; the day was absolutely still — sunless and oppressive. Giles laid his hand on her arm. ‘You know, I have this feeling that too much introspection will get us nowhere. Shall we move? I'm getting rather tired of these fish.’ They walked on into the thickening woodland. Giles still had his hand under her elbow; she stopped to adjust the strap of her sandal as a pretext to shake it off. I can get through all this, she thought, so long as he doesn't touch me. I think I can. They were following the concrete channel of the serpentine rill, which emptied itself into a pool of stygian blackness. Giles paused to peer into it. ‘No fish. Really, this place can be  extraordinarily melancholy on occasion. Perhaps I shouldn't have brought you here.’ ‘I would have said what I have if we'd gone to a fun-fair,’ said Helen. He laughed. ‘There! That's what's so engaging about you but of course you're the one person who can't see that. I hope I am not to be cast absolutely into the outer darkness, Helen — I should find that very wretched.’ I see, she thought, he is to be the one who is rejected; that is how it is to be. They came out into the open. A little temple presided over a sloping hillside with a prospect of open fields and river lined with reeds and willows. A pair of swans cruised, with cygnets, and swallows were zipping to and fro above the water. Giles said, ‘Something's on fire.’ ‘Stubble burning.’ Helen realised now that the sky was overcast not by cloud but by hanging palls of smoke. The edges of the landscape fumed. At the far end of the valley, beyond the river and the water-meadows, was a rim of red; they could hear crackling. ‘It's a disgrace,’ said Giles. ‘It's been allowed to get quite out of hand. There should be new legislation.’ They walked on, past a classical arcade, past an Apollo and a sequence of nymphs. Waterlilies swung at the edge of the river; willows rained down. The air was now quite acrid; Helen saw that the sleeve of her shirt was covered with dark specks of ash. Giles was talking of childhood holidays in Devon; hayfields filled with wild flowers, corn-sheaves, butterflies. A vanished countryside. And horse-drawn waggons and smocked farmworkers, I daresay, thought Helen: everything is embroidered by recollection. Even today, no doubt. Eventually. They reached the car. He drove her back to Greystones, still talking fluently of things that mattered not at all. As he opened the door of the car for her to get out he smiled, a smile that appeared eloquent both of regret and appeal. Then he laid his hand on her shoulder for an instant, got back into the driving-seat, and was gone. She walked up the path towards the front door. You could  smell burning here, too. The sky above the Britches was sepia-coloured, as though a storm were imminent. She registered all this, opened the front door and knew also, immediately, that there was something alien about the house. She called ‘Edward?’, and then remembered that he had gone out with the ornithological group. She walked into the kitchen and Phil was sitting at the table. He got up. His green crest, she saw, was now tinged with brown at the roots. So it did grow out. He looked extremely unhealthy; the anxious eyes of a child peered at her from a white mask. He said ‘The front door was locked, so I got through the window at the back. Edward wasn’ here either.’ Helen removed her coat and filled the kettle. She felt an unusual surging lust for a cup of tea. ‘We weren't expecting you, Phil.’ ‘I thought I'd come and stay here for a bit. You and Edward don’ min', do you? I mean, I thought since it's my house, sort of, it would be all right. But if you don' wan' me I'll go somewhere else. I mean, I don' care one way or the other. Fact is, I'm a bit pissed off at home.’ He watched her, tensely; his eyes were those of a five-year-old. She took two cups and saucers from the dresser and put them on the table; she got the milk from the fridge. ‘That's all right. You can stay if you want to. I'll find some sheets presently and you can make up a bed in the spare room. But I do think you should tell your parents. Ask your parents,’ she amended. ‘That's fine,’ said Phil. ‘I rung mum. She said it sounds like a good idea, till I get myself together.’ ‘She did, did she?’ said Helen in a different tone. The kettle spurted. She made the tea, poured two cups. ‘Thanks,’ said Phil. Helen took a gulp of tea, and felt herself begin to rally. She looked at Phil; he was encased from top to toe in black leather, as always. ‘Don't you want to take your jacket off — you must be awfully hot?’ Phil, vaguely, shrugged off the jacket which fell to the floor with a metallic clatter. Beneath it he wore a T-shirt of quite astonishing filthiness. ‘The thing is, I'm not getting on with Mum and Dad. I mean, we're all pissed off with each other.’ ‘That can happen.’ ‘I ‘spect,’ he continued magnanimously, ‘s'partly my fault too.’ ‘I daresay,’ said Helen. After a moment she added, with sudden hope ‘What about school? Surely the term starts soon.’ ‘I can't remember,’ said Phil evasively. ‘Anyway, that's not important. The thing is to get myself together. I got problems.’ Helen refilled both cups. Phil slurped his with one gulp. He seemed restored; his crest stood perkily again. ‘I got to sort myself out, see.’ ‘Well,’ said Helen. ‘We've all got problems, but you're welcome to stay here for a bit.’ Phil looked at her over his cup with kindly reproach. He ignored the first part of her statement. ‘Thanks, Helen.’ ‘Actually,’ said Louise, ‘it's the perfect solution. I don't know why I didn't think of it myself. I mean, you and Edward aren't involved emotionally like we are, and he's not going to get up your nose in the same way and I'll know where he is and that he's all right. It's the obvious arrangement. At least he rang. Though of course you would have done anyway. Not that he was what you'd call forthcoming. A series of grunts, which is mainly what I get these days. There are points when I wonder if he actually hates me, or if he's not yet got beyond the level of contempt and indifference. I look at him — when I can bear to and frankly if you can persuade him to use a clean T-shirt you'll be doing all of us a favour — I look at him and I remember dear little chubby hands clutching one, and the way their faces used to smell of soap and milk. What happened to all that? Anyway, at least he rang. Maybe it indicates some normal human responses. And I'll know where he is and roughly what he's up to. Though…is there a drug scene in the village yet? All right, I daresay you don't — but there's no need to snap, I have been pretty well at the end of my tether. You don't know what it's like wondering what the hell he's up to now and where he's gone and when he'll be back. And the grunts and the glares and the  slammed doors and that bloody T-shirt. Do try and get him to eat some decent food. And keep me informed. Unless of course he deigns to ring again himself. You might point out that one has feelings. Anyway… So how are things with you?’ ‘How long for?’ said Edward. It was Helen who made up the spare room bed, in the end. Phil, it appeared, had spent his life under a duvet; the technical problem posed by sheets and blankets defeated him. He dumped himself in the battered armchair and watched her, chatting cosily the while. He seemed to have taken on a new lease of life. ‘I like it here. S'a nice house. S'not smart. I don’ like smart houses. Actually, that's what I like about you and Edward. You're not smart either. Not like Mum and Dad's friends. They know some shocking people, really shocking.’ ‘Mmn. Could you pass me that pillow.’ ‘All right if I put up some posters? S'a bit boring the way it is, this room.’ ‘I suppose so. I can't think quite what you're going to find to do here, you know, Phil.’ ‘You don’ need to worry about me,’said Phil reassuringly. ‘I'll probably be spending quite a lot of time writing poetry.’ ‘Oh. I see. What sort of poetry do you write?’ ‘Protest poetry, mos'ly,’ said Phil in a business-like tone. ‘Edward won’ min' if I borrow his typewriter, will he?’ She had given tea to Phil. Had drunk tea herself, telephoned Louise, taken Edward aside and explained, made up the spare room bed. And all through this she did not think of Giles. She did not take those hours out and contemplate them; she simply let them lie somewhere in the head, to surface no doubt at some point of low resistance. The small hours of the morning, conventionally. From time to time that evening she was visited by the sight of the lake with its gold fretwork of fish; she wondered how  many years it would be before she could go to that place with equanimity. And, thinking this, she knew that the thought itself was the first, faint, early signal of recovery. It was as though, at the height of a fever, you experienced a fleeting moment of wellbeing. Eventually, she thought, it will all be over. I shan't care. But before then there is a long way to go. Now, tonight, there is nothing to look forward to, no reason to get up in the morning or move from one day into the next. I have been someone else these last few months; now I have to learn to be myself again."
FIC FIC-H9D-002 -0.31 "THE WORLD OF LEARNING The room on the first floor of Meadowbanks, Viola Machin's house, in which Mr Kronweiser plied his research was very tiny indeed. A gimcrack modern desk table (‘Good enough for him’) had been placed there, and there were a few shelves, stocked with the works of Walter Machin, cheap editions of Lawrence, Walter Greenwood, Orwell, Sillitoe and others, and copies of periodicals which had contributed to the revival of interest in Machin's books. These were the basic tools of Mr Kronweiser's research, and the study was only just big enough to hold them and him. Dwight Kronweiser came to this room every day, spending his mornings going through the manuscript fiction, personal letters and other papers which had been stored in the attic for thirty years before his arrival. He made transcripts of the fiction, and of all the other major documents. These he carried home, partly because the little room lacked storage space, partly to appease the secretive, magpie instinct which was part of his nature: he loved to keep, hide, obfuscate, cover his tracks; he had fantasies in the watches of the night of other scholars stealing a march on him and publishing the definitive study of Walter Machin first (though how that would be possible, in view of his privileged position, he would have been hard put to it to say). He saw mainly the cloak and dagger aspects of scholarship, and acted accordingly. Home, for Mr Kronweiser, was a large bedroom in a  working-class house to the north of the town. In spite of his expressed desire to soak up atmosphere, he did not feel at home there. His landlady didn't understand him. So he spent long days and evenings at Meadowbanks, working (when he had done a stint of transcription) on the manuscript which was destined to be the Walter Machin volume in the Payne's Great Authors series of monographs. He sat at his desk, the edge pressed hard against his belly, seeming not to have an ounce of surplus bone in his body, meditating, cogitating, moulding his concrete blocks of critical prose: The major problem Machin confronts in The Factory Whistle is that of irrelation, which in its turn is his means of defining the absolute. The complementary, interpenetrating phenomena in proletarian life that the implied narrator confronts, and by confronting epiphanizes, are a means primarily of defining his own ambivalent relation both to the zeitgeist and to his own eternal validity. Mr Kronweiser stared at the ceiling in creative agony for a space, and then, neatly scoring through the word ‘validity’, he substituted ‘authenticity’. Having changed this stage in the argument to his liking, Dwight Kronweiser began contemplating his next deathless paragraph, and gazed fixedly ahead of him as polysyllabic concepts moved through his mind like heavy artillery on parade. In the middle of this elephantine travail, there came a knock on the door. Mr Kronweiser's reaction was odd: he sprang to a crouch over his manuscript, then put a piece of clean paper over it. Then he blinked his eyes nervously, and said: ‘Yes?’ It was Hilda Machin, peeping round the door with a cocksparrow expression, like the coming of spring. ‘Well, hello, Mrs — er — Machin, this is an honour,’ said Dwight Kronweiser, uncurling himself from his protective  position, then getting up with an attempt at expansiveness. ‘I appreciate your looking me up in my cubby-hole, I really do. Now, do sit down a moment — we can just fit another chair in here.’ And he bustled out on to the landing to fetch a straight-backed chair that stood there for no particular reason. As he did so, he kept darting his eyes nervously back to his little room and the manuscript on the desk; but when he got back in, puffing a little, he was smiling and giving little mutters of pleasure: ‘Well, this sure is nice of you, real friendly…’ Hilda Machin settled herself down on the chair, smiling happily and looking guilelessly at Mr Kronweiser who, if the truth were known, amused her very much. She looked disparagingly round his little cubby-hole as he squeezed his belly back into its pouch in the middle of the desk. ‘You are cramped in here, aren't you?’ she said. ‘She could have given you a bit more room.’ ‘Believe me, I'm deeply grateful to be given any sort of study at all, deeply grateful. Just the chance to transcribe the manuscripts was the most fantastic luck, the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'd have been happy to transcribe them just anyplace.’ ‘Oh, we wouldn't want to let them out of our sight,’ said Hilda. Mr Kronweiser was unsure about that ‘we’: was it a plural, or was it an ironic reference to Viola Machin? He laughed nervously. ‘Anyway, she could have given you the study downstairs,’ continued Hilda. ‘It's not used, and that way you could have kept everything together. You've no room here to keep anything at all.’ ‘Oh, I keep everything at home — I file them there, on my own system,’ said Mr Kronweiser eagerly. ‘I shouldn't in any case keep the originals and the transcripts in one place, no sir. You never know what might eventuate.’ ‘Really?’ said Hilda, wide-eyed. ‘What sort of eventuations had you in mind? Burglary? Fire?’ ‘Believe you me, anything can happen,’ said Mr  Kronweiser, with gloomy relish. ‘Friend of mine at Duke — had his PhD stolen — all the manuscripts, notes, card indexes, the whole caboodle! It turned up a year later, all rewritten but basically identical, as a PhD at San Diego. No kidding! And there wasn't a damned thing he could do about it. Another guy had his in his car. Parked it to buy a pack of cigarettes — the car was stolen by a couple of kids going joy-riding. They used the PhD to light a bonfire to barbecue some steaks they'd nicked. Judge said he couldn't put an estimate on the value of the typescript, and ignored it in the sentence. Boy! That guy was sore as a cowboy's…’ Mr Kronweiser faded out abruptly and subsided into coughs. He was sweating heavily with emotion. ‘Ee, well, you do lead exciting lives,’ said Hilda Machin. ‘I'd never have guessed.’ ‘Others just buy and sell them,’ continued Kronweiser lugubriously. ‘Regular black market. Three thous the going rate, or was a few years back. No go nowadays. The bottom's dropped right out of the market.’ ‘Oh? Why's that?’ ‘Hell, with eighty per cent of PhDs unemployed, what's the point?’ ‘So that's why you keep your transcripts at home, is it?’ said Hilda, still looking at Kronweiser with an expression of absorbed interest. ‘I suppose it is safer.’ ‘Hell yes. And I mail a carbon to Jackson's. That way we're triply safe. Anyway, I'm through with the fiction, so that side of it's sewn up.’ ‘Really? Is it all transcribed?’ ‘Yep. Finished the last short story today — barring unforeseen discoveries, naturally.’ ‘Which one is that?’ asked Hilda, putting out her hand towards the manuscript on the desk. Mr Kronweiser sprang into his earlier stance of crouching flabby tiger, then with a deprecatory smile he relaxed stiffly and began rummaging in the top drawer. ‘That's my manuscript  there,’ he said hesitatingly; ‘naturally I feel its manifest imperfections.’ He took out a typescript, to which was attached a handwritten manuscript. With visible reluctance he handed it to Hilda Machin. ‘Oh, one of the early ones,’ she said brightly, handling the work of her late husband with no notable reverence, and casually flicking through it. ‘Handwritten. Yes, I remember it. He wrote it — let's see — one wet Sunday. It must have been about nineteen thirty-seven or eight. It's a poor piece, or so he thought. He didn't include it in Colton Town.’ ‘Very true. But there were one or two deeply interesting passages in that story, invaluable for the thesis I shall present in my study of his work. And it will fill out the new volume of shorter pieces too.’ Hilda, deep in her reading, nevertheless perked up at this and shot a sharp glance in Mr Kronweiser's direction. ‘Oh, so there will be two new volumes, will there?’ ‘That's right. The second novel, of course, and then the shorter pieces — stories and some newspaper articles, and so on . We should easily make it into two hundred pages or so.’ ‘Well, I'm glad about that. What are you going to call them? I suppose it will be you as will give them their titles?’ ‘In the case of the novel that won't be necessary. He left behind a list of alternatives. Perhaps you'd like to have a look at them?’ On Hilda Machin's nodding, Mr Kronweiser calmly took back the copy of the short story and the original manuscript, clipped them together, and put them back carefully in their right place in the drawer. Then he went to another drawer and extracted a piece of paper, squinting at it carefully before he handed it over. ‘This is it,’ he said. ‘Just as he left it.’ The typescript (with odd mis-spellings and typing errors reproduced from the original) ran to nine or ten  titles. Hilda Machin read it with every appearance of interest. ‘Spinning Jenny’, she said with contempt. ‘Pretty obvious that. The Loon of Age — now that really would put people off: what was Walter thinking of? Satanic Mills bit overdone: he made a nice enough living out of them…. Ee, they're all a bit tired, aren't they?’ ‘You have no preferences, then?’ ‘Not I. You might as well call it Trouble up at t'Mill and have done with it as far as I'm concerned. You know, I think the thing was that he was out of date, and by the time he wrote the second book he knew it. He began too late. If he'd started in the early ‘thirties, when we were courting and when the Depression was really biting, then he'd have done all right. But all Walter thought about at that time was slap and tickle in the grass, and you can quote me on that, as knows. But it was years before he got started, and ‘thirty-nine before he got published. By then it was too late. People were tired of that sort of thing. Then there was t'war and all. Poor old Walter. He missed the band-wagon.’ The list dropped from her hand, and Mr Kronweiser seized on it to restore it to its place. ‘It's heart-warming,’ volunteered Mr Kronweiser, ‘that justice will be done to him at last.’ ‘I don't suppose it will warm his heart,’ said Hilda. ‘So I'll note down that you have no special wishes about the title, then, Mrs Machin.’ ‘Not really. I haven't read the book, or not much of it, that I remember. I suppose Tripe and Onions was the best of them. One of the ones with ‘tripe’ in it, anyway.’ Dwight Kronweiser looked at her hard, blinking his pale, short-sighted eyes. Hilda Machin pulled herself up and looked at her wristwatch in mock consternation. ‘Well, this isn't getting the cow milked. What I came for was, I brought that letter you were talking about.’ ‘The one from London?’ ‘That's the one. I found it in my old snap album. Daft  place to put it, but there… He talks about seeing his publisher, and getting a better contract for the next book. It was June, ‘thirty-nine, as you can see. I knew I'd had a letter from him then, because it was the last time we were apart before he was called up.’ ‘Hmm, hmm,’ said Mr Kronweiser, reading the letter through with little snuffles of academic contentment. ‘Neat! Very good. I'm deeply grateful to you, Mrs Machin, deeply grateful. I'll see you get it back in no time at all.’ ‘Oh, don't worry,’ said Hilda, getting up to go. ‘I'm not sentimental about him, you know — far from it.’ ‘Now you do yourself an injustice there, I know. As I say, I'll get it back to you just as soon as I've managed to make a copy of it.’ ‘And you'll file it with the other stuff, will you?’ asked Hilda Machin at the door. ‘Infinite riches in a little room?’ As she closed the door after her, Mr Kronweiser looked at it for a minute or two in puzzlement. Wasn't that some sort of quotation? He couldn't quite place it. Not his period, anyway. Or was it a proverb? Either way, he couldn't make that dame out. What's more, he didn't like her — which meant, in Kronweiser idiom, that he didn't trust her — which meant, in its turn, that she was not wholly devoted to the interests of Dwight Kronweiser, MA, Ph.D. What was she up to? What made her tick? How sharp was she? He didn't like the way her accent changed, he didn't like the way she'd sit there looking cosy as a mother chook and then shoot a sharp glance at him, like she understood him through and through. Mr Kronweiser didn't know where he stood with her, and he hated that feeling. He looked back to the letter, and went through it again — still thinking and frowning. That night, as Hilda Machin was boiling milk in the kitchen for her good night cup of coffee, an unusual thing  happened. Viola Machin came to the kitchen. Came quite deliberately, though as usual Hilda had made plenty of noise coming down the stairs to ensure that her presence was known. On Viola's approach down the hall, Hilda turned up the gas and made preparation for a hasty departure, but this, it seemed, was not the idea. ‘No, no, don't hurry, Hilda,’ said Viola, sailing in, all arrogant bosom and cold cream, but smiling condescendingly. She went to the bread bin and seemed to be preparing to make herself a piece of toast. Hilda did not turn down the gas. ‘We have been a little silly sometimes in the past, don't you think, Hilda?’ went on Viola. ‘I'm sure that once in a while we can be in the same kitchen without explosions occurring, don't you agree? We are civilized people, after all.’ ‘Aye, ‘appen,’ said Hilda. Nothing annoyed Viola Machin more, as a general rule, than Hilda putting on the broad Lancashire. It seemed to her like an assertion of closeness to the dead Walter that she could not match. But tonight her face seemed frozen into its gracious expression, like royalty in a traffic jam, and if she wished to herself that Hilda would make the odd concession so that civil conversation with her could be easier, nothing of this appeared in her manner. ‘Mr Kronweiser seems to be getting on very nicely with the transcriptions,’ said Viola, slotting the bread into the toaster. ‘Oh aye?’ said Hilda. ‘You went to see him this morning…?’ ‘That's right.’ Viola Machin repressed a sigh. ‘Did you have anything interesting to show him?’ ‘Well,’ said Hilda, raising her voice slightly, ‘I didn't go for the pleasure of his company. I didn't go because I was suddenly seized by an overwhelming passion for him, we didn't make love on the tiger-skin rug in that little box of a  room you gave him, his pear-shaped body pressed against my ageing but still voluptuous frame.’ Viola Machin left a few moments' pause. ‘You know, I've always thought it was your sense of humour that attracted Walter to you, Hilda.’ ‘Because otherwise it's totally inexplicable, eh?’ ‘Now, Hilda, let's not start that silly bickering, please. You can't say I came here tonight wanting a row — that you can't say.’ ‘No, you came here wanting to know what I'd been saying to Mr Kronweiser today.’ Viola Machin, seated in a dignified pose on the corner of the kitchen table, her white and pale blue brunch coat billowing around her, found her pose of aggrieved innocence difficult to keep up. ‘All right, all right . I admit it,’ she said. ‘And the answer is: I took him a letter.’ ‘Oh yes — er — one of Walter's?’ ‘One of Walter's,’ said Hilda, looking concentratedly at Viola. ‘When he was in London. Seeing his publishers. June nineteen thirty-nine. OK?’ ‘Was there anything in it? Anything…personal?’ ‘He sent his love. Is that all right? Not too hot to handle, for an old-fashioned family publisher like Jackson's? Oh, and there was love and kisses for Rose too.’ ‘I see. So there was nothing more…controversial. Well, I'm glad. I'm sure he'll find it very useful. I'm looking forward to reading his book.’ ‘So'm I. Don't get many good laughs these days.’ ‘Now Hilda! I'm sure he'll do a very good job…’ ‘The idea of a chap like that, writing a book on Walter: it's enough to make the cat laugh.’ ‘Well, he was interested — and he was the first. Of course, if I'd waited just a few months, I could have had anyone I liked. But there: I couldn't have known the interest there'd be.’ ‘There's one comfort,’ said Hilda, sipping her coffee. ‘He treats his manuscript like a mummy lion her cubs. With a bit of luck he won't be able to bear to part with it to a publisher. Save us all a lot of red faces.’ ‘I don't think, Hilda, that you're approaching this revival of interest in Walter's work in the right frame of mind.’ ‘Oh me — I'm tickled pink. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have kept quiet about you and him, would I?’ Viola Machin, torn between a desire to protest that she had nothing to hide, and a feeling that she had, said at last, reluctantly: ‘Well, yes, that's true: and I'm grateful to you for that, Hilda.’ ‘So you should be. But there's one thing, Viola, that I don't think you really realize.’ ‘What's that?’ ‘That Kronweiser. You think he's an idiot, because he gets things wrong-the background, the politics, Walter, us. And he does, all the time. But: he's not stupid, Viola. He's not stupid. And I think we both ought to realize that. Otherwise —’ Hilda Machin looked at her husband's second wife, raised an eyebrow, and then flopped in her furry slippers down the hall. Viola Machin bent heavily over the table buttering her toast — very, very thoughtful."
FIC FIC-J10-006 -0.17 "CHAPTER 6 ‘No,’ said Zeinab. ‘Look, let's not be too hasty —’ ‘I do not understand. First you are on this case, then you are off. One moment you give all your time to it, you don't come home till late at night, you don't even come home in the afternoon like ordinary men, the next you are giving no time to it at all. Is it the same man, I ask myself?’ ‘Of course it's the same man. It's just that —’ ‘Don't you care at all what you do? Or is it that your feelings suddenly alter? They switch and change all the time, phu! like this. You are,’ said Zeinab, ‘emotionally erratic.’ ‘It's nothing to do with emotion —’ ‘Oh?’ said Zeinab, bridling. ‘You don't care about Leila? You don't care about a poor girl, alone and brutally murdered? You have no feeling? Is that it?’ ‘No, that's not it. Of course I care. But —’ ‘She is only a woman, is that it?’ said Zeinab, firing up. ‘An Egyptian woman, yes? What is a mere Egyptian woman to the mighty British? They brush her aside, yes, like a fly.’ ‘Calm down, calm down! I am very concerned —’ ‘Concern! Pah! Is that all? I am concerned too. I am concerned that you have a heart of stone. I am concerned that with you one minute it is this, the next it is that. I am concerned that the man who is here today is not the same as the man who was here yesterday. I —’ ‘OK, OK.’ This was going to be as difficult as he had imagined. ‘It's not me that changes,’ he said mildly. ‘It's just that — well, circumstances change.’ ‘And you change with them, yes? Just like that. Something happens and immediately you change.’ ‘No. It's not like that.’ ‘It's not? Well, it seems to me just like that. We talk, we agree, I go away and start doing something, and then suddenly it's all different. It all changes. You blow hot, you blow cold. You go to bed saying one thing, you wake up saying another.’ ‘It's not like that.’ ‘Oh, isn't it? I am glad. Because I thought perhaps it was the same with me. Now you love me, now you don't.’ ‘You know I love you.’ ‘But that,’ said Zeinab, ‘is precisely what I don't know. Now that we have all this change. You loved me yesterday, or so I believed. Yes, I believed you. But tomorrow? Will you love me then?’ The large dark eyes stared at him tragically. Owen, who had suspected that Zeinab was enjoying the drama, melted totally. ‘Of course I will!’ ‘You say it,’ said Zeinab sombrely, ‘as if you meant it. But then, you spoke about Leila in that way too.’ ‘That's different.’ ‘Oh? Why is it different?’ ‘That — well, that's work.’ ‘I do not make that distinction,’ said Zeinab. ‘At work you've got to go along with things more. You're subject to pressures.’ ‘I see.’ She sat there silently for a few moments. Owen hoped that she was calming down. ‘That's it, is it?’ she said suddenly. ‘What?’ ‘Pressure.’ ‘Arguments, rather.’ ‘And you have been persuaded by these arguments?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, I haven't,’ said Zeinab. ‘You haven't heard them,’ Owen pointed out. ‘You won't tell me them. You can't,’ said Zeinab, ‘tell me them. And do you know why? Because they are British arguments. They are not my arguments, they are not even your arguments. They are British arguments.’ She suddenly dissolved into floods of tears. ‘I hate you!’ she said. ‘I hate you!’ ‘Oh, look —’ ‘No. Don't touch me. It is not the man I love who touches me, it is the British.’ ‘You mustn't see it like that!’ ‘I see it like that because it is like that.’ ‘It is not like that.’ ‘No? Tell me then: are you going to do what they say?’ ‘Well —’ ‘You see,’ said Zeinab. Mahmoud had a case that morning in the Mixed Tribunals and Owen wanted to send a letter to England so they agreed to meet at noon at the Post Office. Mahmoud wasn't there when he arrived, so he went inside to buy his stamps and then came out to use the wet roller hanging against the wall. The heat tended to dry up  the gum on stamps and getting them to stick on was the very devil. Facing the front of the Post Office was a long row of seal-makers and scribes squatting in the dust with their customers. The ordinary Egyptian could not write and if he wished to send a letter he would have to get a scribe to write it for him. And since he could not sign it he would use a seal. Owen wondered suddenly whether Leila had been able to write. Almost certainly not, for few women could. How, then, did Narouz communicate with her? If by note, then she would have had to get a scribe to read it to her. But perhaps Narouz sent a messenger. In either case the man would know the message: and in either case they ought to be able to find him. But he was forgetting. Mahmoud came out of the Mixed Tribunals and crossed the street towards him. He was carrying a huge bundle of papers and didn't want to walk far, so they went into the Arab cafe beside the Post Office. Mahmoud dumped the papers on a chair and sat down with relief. He had, he told Owen, been on his feet all morning. ‘Did you get anywhere?’ ‘No,’ said Mahmoud. ‘The usual.’ The Egyptian system of courts was one of the most complicated in the world. Foreigners in Egypt received considerable legal privileges. In some cases they could be tried only by their own national courts and cases had to be remitted to Smyrna or Ankara or wherever it was. In other cases, where an Egyptian national was involved as well as a foreigner, the case had to be sent to the Mixed Courts, where the law was different from that in the ordinary Egyptian courts. The possibilities for evasion were endless. Owen commiserated. Mahmoud shrugged his shoulders. ‘You get used to it,’ he said. He was, understandably, not very cheerful this morning. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘they told me yesterday.’ ‘What did they tell you? To drop it?’ ‘No, no. They wouldn't do that. If a case is closed, you've got to say why. Sometimes,’ said Mahmoud, ‘bureaucracy has its uses.’ ‘What did they tell you, then?’ ‘Basically, to leave it alone for a while. A long, long while. To concentrate on something else. That's why,’ said Mahmoud, tapping the bundle of papers, ‘they've given me this. I had to get it all up last night. I've got another one for tomorrow. And the day after. I don't think,’ he said, ‘they trust me to do nothing.’ He laughed, but it was an injured, bitter laugh. If you were a Parquet lawyer you got used to cases getting nowhere; but that didn't mean you liked it. ‘It's Narouz, isn't it?’ he said. ‘He's fixed it.’ Owen nodded. ‘Well,’ said Mahmoud, ‘it was always on the cards. He's a member of the Royal Family. They wouldn't want to go too close to the Khedive. What I can't understand, though, is why the British should want to get involved.’ ‘They don't want to get involved. All they want to do is make sure it doesn't blow up into anything.’ ‘For the sake of the Khedive?’ ‘Certainly not for the sake of Narouz.’ Mahmoud, fortunately, did not probe. ‘I wouldn't have thought they'd have bothered,’ he said. It was the custom in Egypt, on the Friday after a body had been interred, for the women of the family to visit the tomb, where they would break a palm branch over the grave and distribute cakes and bread to the poor. When Ali Marwash's daughter died the custom was followed to the letter since the girl was Ali Marwash's only child and he cared for her more then he probably would have done had there been sons in the family. The mourners went to the tomb and a fiki, a professional holy reader, especially hired for the occasion, chanted the appropriate verses from the Koran. The palm branch was broken and placed on the grave and the cakes and bread distributed. The party was about to depart when the mother of the dead girl noticed that the earth over the entrance to the tomb had been disturbed, and when she looked more closely she saw that one of the roofing stones had been moved. Grave-robbing in Egypt was a traditional pursuit and she immediately feared the worst. Ali Marwash was not a rich man, but he had loved his daughter and had wrapped her in a Kashmir shawl before interring her. It was normal to tear the shawl first so that its value would not tempt a profane person to violate the tomb; but the shawl had been a beautiful one and he had not been able to bring himself to do that. His wife now feared that they had been punished for his presumption. Her screams attracted a large crowd and the fiki, taking control, sent someone to fetch her husband. A sheikh was summoned and with his authority and before a vast concourse of onlookers the tomb was reopened. The mother's fears were realized, for the tomb had indeed been violated. Her daughter's body had been removed altogether. And in its place, stacked high in the subterranean vault, was a large pile of guns and ammunition. The police were called at once and the District Chief of Police, whose recent experiences had reinforced a strong natural tendency towards caution, sent immediately for the Mamur Zapt. By the time Owen arrived the crowd was sixty deep and he had to get his constables to clear a way through. The tomb consisted of an oblong brick vault with an arched roof high enough to allow a person buried in it to sit up with care when visited by the two examining angels, Munkar and Nekeer. On top of this was a solid brick monument with an upright stone. The entrance was through a  small separate cell to the north-east, and it was this which had been tampered with. Owen stepped down into the cell, bent and looked through the doorway into the burial vault. At first he could not see anything, but then someone pushed a lighted torch in front of him and he caught the gleam of the bluish-grey metal inside. It was a large cache of arms. He pulled one out. It was a rifle in pristine condition, still greasy from the packing case and with the heavy, cold distinctive smell he knew so well. The man holding the torch was, he saw now, one of the local constables he had used on the arms search. ‘Is this it, effendi?’ said the man excitedly. Owen slipped his hand in again and felt around on the floor. His hand closed around an object. He pulled it out and looked at it. It was a clip of ammunition, exactly similar to those left behind in the kuttub in the fountain-house. ‘Oh, good,’ said Garvin, ‘I was afraid you'd forgotten about things like that, with your recent preoccupations.’ He was, nevertheless, in a genial mood this morning. A bearer slipped in behind Owen and stood up a gun in the corner behind Garvin's desk. That accounted for it. It was a sporting gun. ‘Bag anything this morning?’ ‘Two hare and a hoopoe.’ ‘Hoopoe?’ ‘It happened to be there so I potted it.’ It was possible to get good, though restricted, shooting within an hour's ride from Cairo and sometimes Garvin went out in the early morning before coming to the office. For duck you needed really to go north, to the big lakes around Alexandria and, of course, for big game you had to go south. But hare and even the odd gazelle were available locally. Like many of the British, Garvin brought his past with  him. He was the son of a ‘squarson’, a country parson who had the standing and habits of a squire. Garvin had been brought up to hunting and shooting, skills which in the opinion of the Consul-General exactly equipped a young man for a career in the Ministry of the Interior. Those and one other: facility at learning Arabic. Cromer had expected all his staff to speak Arabic fluently and Garvin, after twenty years in Egypt, spoke the language like a native. He also knew the country like a native. ‘Oh, good,’ said Owen. ‘Foolish of them,’ said Garvin. ‘They must have known the women would be back.’ ‘I don't think they meant to leave them there,’ said Owen. ‘They had to move them in a hurry when my people started going through the district and it was just intended as a temporary hiding-place. My guess is that they meant to come back, only with so much police activity they didn't like to risk it.’ ‘So all that farting around actually achieved something?’ ‘The operation was successful, yes. The trouble is,’ said Owen, ‘that it was only partly successful. We got the arms but not the men.’ ‘Well, at least it means that if we're shot, it'll be by another lot of guns. That's something.’ ‘There'll be other shipments. We've got to get the men. So I'm keeping some people down in Al-Gadira.’ ‘They'll be miles away by now,’ said Garvin. ‘I don't know that they will. My hunch is that they're local. Why did they move the arms in the first place? Because they saw the search coming their way. That suggests they were in the area. What did they do? They moved them out of the way but not out of the district, just to somewhere handy where they could easily pick them up. That suggests they were local, too.’ Garvin nodded his head in acknowledgement. ‘Who have you got down there?’ ‘Georgiades.’ ‘He's all right,’ said Garvin. ‘Yes. There's another thing, too. While he's down there he can keep his eyes open generally. There seems to be a lot happening in Al-Gadira just now.’ He told Garvin about Leila. ‘That girl?’ said Garvin. ‘I thought you were dropping that?’ ‘I'm distancing myself. But I couldn't help noticing that was Al-Gadira too.’ ‘Coincidence,’ said Garvin dismissively. ‘Maybe. But she lived there and she died there.’ ‘Her body was washed up there. That's not the same thing.’ ‘It's what happened to her body.’ ‘Half way to Alexandria by now, I would say.’ ‘Well,’ said Owen, ‘it might not be.’ ‘Does it matter?’ asked Garvin. ‘Yes,’ said Owen. He found it difficult to pick the right words. Everything that came to mind seemed inappropriate. He wanted to say ‘untidy’ but that was ridiculously inappropriate. Then he wanted to say that you couldn't have bodies floating around but ‘floating’, in the circumstances, was hardly the word. ‘It might pop up at an awkward moment,’ he said, which was hardly any better.’ ‘We'll have to risk that,’ said Garvin briskly. Owen was deliberating whether this was the moment. Garvin seemed fairly amenable this morning. He might never have a better chance. ‘I wonder if we're handling this in the right way,’ he said cautiously. He didn't need to work through Garvin. Although Garvin was shown as his formal superior in terms of the office organization chart, that was to some extent a convenient fiction and the Mamur Zapt had his own lines of communication to the powers that were. Garvin, however, played bridge with the Consul-General  and was a member of his social circle. The habit of the British overseas was to replicate the governing patterns of the Establishment in London, with its loose formal structure and very tight informal one, articulated through a wide variety of social occasions, and Egypt was no exception. Owen was, he was aware, a hired man and not a member of the charmed social circle and if he wanted to get things done he had to do it indirectly by tweaking the inner social system. ‘What do you mean?’ said Garvin, looking at him sharply. ‘Letting Narouz block it. It's bound to get out and then it will look as if we're helping the Khedive to cover up. Is that a good idea?’ ‘He's the Government, isn't he?’ ‘Yes, but this kind of thing gives the Government a bad name. Do we want to be all that closely identified with the Government over a thing like this?’ ‘A thing like what?’ ‘Corruption. Possible murder.’ ‘What are you saying?’ ‘I'm saying we should let Mahmoud go on investigating this case. Seriously, I mean.’ Garvin looked at him searchingly, then looked away. ‘There are one or two things on at the moment,’ he said. ‘I know. The Agreement.’ ‘Well, then.’ ‘I don't see that the two have to go together.’ ‘They go together,’ said Garvin, ‘because the only legal basis we have for being in Egypt is that we're here by the Khedive's invitation. It's a personal thing, there's no formal treaty or anything like that. It's just his invitation. And he's prepared to renew it, provided we're prepared to look after him and see he stays in power.’ ‘Would a thing like this stop him from staying in power?’ ‘It might.’ ‘We don't have to do everything he wants,’ said Owen, exasperated. ‘Certainly not. But we do have to do everything he wants for the next month or so.’ ‘I was hoping,’ said Owen, ‘that you might be able to have a word —’ ‘I'm afraid not,’ said Garvin. ‘This is unreasonable,’ said Owen. ‘On the contrary,’ said Zeinab. ‘You don't love me; so why should we make love?’ ‘I do love you.’ ‘You don't listen to me,’ said Zeinab, ‘let alone love me.’ ‘I am doing what I can. I've been trying to persuade them —’ ‘Persuade them?’ said Zeinab incredulously. ‘Do you have to persuade people to do what is obviously right?’ ‘They don't see it like that. They —’ ‘Why do you always have to take their point of view?’ ‘I am not taking their point of view. I am working within it. ‘I do not follow these sophistries,’ said Zeinab. ‘If I do it too directly they won't listen to me.’ ‘They don't listen to you. You don't listen to me. It is time,’ said Zeinab, ‘that the whole lot of you started listening.’ ‘Listen —’ ‘1,’ said Zeinab, ‘always listen.’ ‘No, you don't. Try and hear what I am saying. I am doing something about it, I am trying to get them to change their mind. I am spending about all my time on the bloody thing —’ ‘Leila,’ said Zeinab. ‘Is that what you mean?’ ‘The case. And it's not even my case. I am not really on it. It's not really anything to do with me.’ ‘An injustice occurs,’ said Zeinab, ‘and it's not really anything to do with you?’ ‘I'm just trying to do a job. I am not trying to put the whole world right. That's something God can do.’ ‘The old Mamur Zapt,’ said Zeinab, ‘would have listened.’ ‘The old Mamur Zapt was a crook.’ ‘And had a weakness for women. There are,’ said Zeinab, ‘many similarities between you. Nevertheless —’ ‘Look, in the old days the Mamur Zapt was responsible for bloody everything in the city. My role is more circumscribed.’ ‘Call yourself Mamur Zapt and you can't do anything when the woman you claim you love pleads to you for justice?’ ‘Look, I'm just concerned with political things —’ ‘Ah!’ said Zeinab. ‘There we have it!’ ‘Yes. And that's not the same thing as ordinary criminal offences. Why don't you go to the Parquet?’ ‘The Parquet,’ said Zeinab, ‘is not political, no? I thought you told me they were a bunch of political, fix-it lawyers? I thought you told me that everything is in the end political? Ah, I see! It is another of these now-it-is, now-it-isn't things. Like your love!’ ‘No,’ said Owen. ‘Not like my love at all.’ ‘Ah, but I think it is! And so,’ said Zeinab, ‘since you do not love me, properly, not truly, not the way I love you, it would not be right for us to make love.’ ‘All right, then,’ said Owen, getting up. ‘If you feel like that.’ ‘I do feel like that. And my feelings are not changeable like yours. I shall feel the same tomorrow.’ ‘Bloody hell!’ ‘And every day, in fact. Until you have made your mind up. The right way, of course.’ ‘Well, that is a problem!’ said Paul. ‘Should it have priority over the future of the British Empire, though? Ordinarily I  would say yes without hesitation. On this occasion, however —’ They were sitting outside on the verandah. Stretching into the distance were the various sports fields of the Club. Far away a hockey match was in progress. The standard of hockey was good. Most officials in Egypt and all the army had served in India. Because of the heat, matches were played in the late afternoon. They had to start promptly at four, however, since the twilight came early in Egypt and by six it was getting too dark to see. There were tennis courts as well. Because you lost so much body water in the heat, small boys brought tumblers of iced water at the end of every set. Even so, by the end of a match you were seriously depleted and most players repaired to the bar to rebuild their resources. ‘We must look for a compromise,’ said Paul. ‘I don't think Zeinab goes in for compromises much,’ said Owen gloomily. ‘It's all or nothing with her. At the moment it's nothing.’ ‘You mustn't give up,’ said Paul firmly. ‘We've got the best brains in Egypt on this. Yours and mine.’ ‘Where politics is concerned,’ said Owen, ‘that is probably true. In your case, at any rate. In things like this, though —’ ‘All problems are in the end political. Wasn't that what you said she said?’ ‘She said I said it.’ ‘And it was very perceptive of you. So let's treat this as a political problem and look for a political solution.’ ‘No, no, no, no. It won't work, I tell you. The only thing that would help would be if we could finish off this Leila business.’ ‘There you are! I told you the problem was a political one.’ ‘Yes, and you also told me, yesterday, that you couldn't do a thing about it.’ ‘That was yesterday and I was solving a different problem then.’ Paul, looking over the fields, considered the matter. There was an indignant shout from the hockey players. A hawk had swooped low over the field of play, picked up the ball in its claws and flown off with it. The ball, however, was too big for it and dropped from its clutch. The referee retrieved it and ordered a bully-off. ‘We must do something about those birds,’ said Paul. ‘They're becoming a problem.’ ‘Is there a political solution for that, too?’ asked Owen. ‘Firepower,’ said Paul, undisconcerted. ‘War is the extension of politics by other means.’ ‘I don't think that will help with Zeinab.’ ‘Compromise,’ said Paul. ‘That's what we've got to go for.’ ‘I tell you Zeinab isn't interested in compromise.’ ‘She adopts a strong negotiating position.’ ‘No, no, it's not like that, Paul. She means what she says.’ ‘Heavens! Unorthodox, too! That does require some thought.’ A whistle blew and the match ended. The hockey players trooped off and began to make their way back towards the clubhouse. ‘The only way forward I can see,’ said Paul, ‘is to distribute the problem through time.’ 'What!’ ‘Yes, that's it. It's simpler than I had thought. In political terms, that is. It's just a straightforward bargaining situation distributed over time.’ ‘What the hell are you talking about, Paul?’ ‘You see, Zeinab's not going to move until the Leila business gets settled. The Leila business is not going to get settled until the Agreement gets signed. (I mean, afterwards who cares a damn what Narouz thinks or does?) So all you've got to do is wait for the Agreement to get signed. Then you can get going on the case. And then, when you've  got that sorted out, things will get sorted out with Zeinab, too.’ ‘How long is all that going to take?’ ‘Oh, if there's no hiccup in the negotiations, the Agreement will be signed within a couple of months or so.’ ‘You mean wait a couple of months? And then sort the case out? And only then —?’ ‘We all have to make sacrifices, Gareth.’ By about ten in the morning the sun was already dazzlingly bright and all living objects were seeking the shade. One of the orderlies came round closing the shutters. The room was plunged into darkness and stayed like that for the rest of the day. At first it was cool and rather pleasant but as the day wore on, the temperature in the room rose. You opened the door into the corridor but not the window into the sun and that way you got — but perhaps this was fancy — a draught of air. I here were fans suspended from the ceilings in each of the rooms but in Owen's view all they did was to move hot air from one place to another and he very rarely switched his on. Besides, they blew the papers all over the place. This morning was papers. He had a pile on his desk which he was working systematically through; reports from agents, neatly docketed and summarized by Nikos, offensive memoranda from the Finance Department, irrelevant offerings from Personnel and aggrieved submissions from the Khedive, the Kadi, the Mufti and all the others who considered that the Mamur Zapt was exceeding his powers. He pushed them all aside. On the end of the desk was a heap of newspapers. The ones he had were in Arabic, French and English. The ones in Italian, Greek, Armenian, Turkish and Amharic would go to other people in the office. Cairo was a polyglot community and had a lively press. Too lively on occasion. One of the Mamur Zapt's duties was to read the press before publication and excise any  passage he considered inflammatory. Censorship? Call it ensuring that people's feelings were not offended. He picked up one of the newspapers and began reading. It was the influential Al-Liwa, nationalist in sympathies and radical in tone. Also windy rhetorical in tone. It was heavy going. His attention wandered. What was he going to do? He had tried all his usual lines, Paul, Garvin, others, the ones he always used when he wanted to get official policy reversed or amended, and he had got nowhere. The Administration, this time, was showing unusual unanimity. Obviously, the Agreement mattered. Well, he didn't mind that; it mattered to him, too. He wanted to stay in Egypt, didn't he? And, unfortunately, that meant going along with the Khedive. They were there by his invitation and only by his invitation. The other powers didn't like it — they wanted Britain to get out of Egypt — but so long as the fiction could be maintained that the British were there at the express request of the Egyptian sovereign, there was not much they could do about it. Owen was all for the Agreement. He was also, on the whole, for the Khedive on the grounds that at least he was the devil they knew. True, there were some things he didn't like about the Khedive's regime, the patronage, the corruption, the inefficiency. He could understand the desire of people like Mahmoud for reform and change. Well, they could certainly have change. The British Government in London, the Administration itself in Egypt, was committed to Progress. Within limits, of course. But it had to be gradual, orderly change, sensible reform, rather on the British model. He was all in favour of that. And there was no real discrepancy, either, between that — in general— and the Agreement. It was only when they got down to the particular that problems arose. And Zeinab, unfortunately, tended to think in terms of the particular. It must be something to do, he decided, with her lack of a formal education. She was very difficult to reason with. He couldn't see much hope that way. But nor could he see much hope any other way. He had tried all other things he knew. Everywhere, the way was blocked. What was he going to do? And then, as his eye flicked mechanically over the page, it caught something tucked away at the bottom of one of the columns."
NWS NWS-A8U-007 -0.12 "Jack Schofield on a company feeling more than the pinch of a weak US economy IBM in a downsizing squeeze. IBM, once Wall Street's darling, is becoming its whipping boy. Its shares slumped from around $170 before the October 1987 crash and instead of recovering with the Index have just touched a seven-year low at $96. This week IBM unveiled plans to shed another 10,000 employees — about 4.5 per cent of its US workforce — saving $1billion a year and it will buy back another $4billion-worth of its own shares. Unfortunately for IBM, its problems are not simply that it has too many staff. Its problems are not even simple. They include threats to its hardware, its software and its networking system, as well as the weakness of the US economy, which is affecting many other suppliers. Although the US economy is not in recession, it has visibly slowed. Profits have fallen for three consecutive quarters and capital spending has fallen in response. Spending on information technology has also declined, demonstrating that the computer industry is no longer recession-proof. Large suppliers such as IBM, DEC and Unisys have undoubtedly suffered. But even in a bad market some firms do better than others. Hewlett-Packard, for example, managed to grow its annual sales 21 per cent to $12billion, and Apple managed a 30 per cent increase to $5billion. And Compaq, competing directly against IBM in desktop PCs, increased sales by 36 per cent and profits by 51 per cent, in its latest quarter. This suggests IBM's problems may be more fundamental. In fact, today's three major computer industry trends — towards ‘downsizing,’ portable operating systems and open networks — are all working against IBM. ‘Downsizing’ simply means that firms are tending to buy smaller computers to do jobs which used to require big ones, and big computers are where IBM makes most of its money. Downsizing has been made possible by the growing power of the microprocessor and the new ‘economies of small’. Given that microcomputer power costs a tenth of the price of minicomputer power, while minicomputer power costs a tenth of the price of mainframe power, a small shift in this direction can make a dramatic difference to revenues. Portable operating systems, such as Unix, are also a threat to IBM and other companies which once prospered on proprietary ones, such as Wang and Data General. Traditionally, computer manufacturers have used proprietary software to ‘lock in’ users, who would then find it impossible or prohibitively expensive, to move their applications to other manufacturers' machines — or even, in IBM's case, different machines from the same manufacturer. This strategy is being made obsolete by Unix, an ‘open’ operating system that runs on hundreds of different computers from hundreds of different manufacturers, from micros and minis through mainframes to supercomputers. Moving applications becomes relatively simple, and turns hardware into a commodity. Manufacturers can no longer charge according to some idea of ‘value’ but must compete on price and performance. This can have a dramatic effect on margins. Open networking provides the means for computers from different vendors to be connected together using OSI (open systems interconnection) standards. OSI enables all the different manufacturers to work to a common set of standards. Again this works against IBM, which is irrevocably committed to its own proprietary networking system, SNA. These changes are not just a matter of following technological devlopments, but reflect the way businesses are changing. Major firms like General Motors and Heinz no longer see themselves as machines needing only periodic maintenance to run forever. They are no longer isolated and no longer see computers as providing mainly internal services such as payroll and stock control. Instead, large corporations are becoming more like living organisms, continually changing and adapting. They must interact with the outside world, and networks of computers are the way to do it. Examples include electronic data interchange (EDI)— ordering stocks and materials and paying bills electronically, instead of using paper — factory automation and JIT (just-in-time) production systems. IBM wants to compete in all these markets and is apparently enthusiastic about AIX (its version of Unix) and OSI. But open systems are backed by governments and controlled by committees, which means IBM cannot dominate or control them. Also by competing it risks cannibalising its own best profit sources: IBM selling an AS/400 mini is a triumph if the buyer would otherwise have chosen a DEC VAX, but a financial disaster for IBM if it replaces an IBM mainframe. Although one IBM manager recently got widespread publicity for pointing out that PCs were overtaking mainframes as IBM's largest source of revenues, this is misleading. IBM's revenues from mainframe processors in calendar 1988 may have been only about $12billion, but sales of peripherals ($11billion), software ($8billion) and maintenance ($7billion) should be added to this. Perhaps two-thirds of IBM's income and an estimated 75 per cent of profits are still tied up in this threatened area. There's no way round that. As one IBMer said: ‘You can't build a $60billion corporation out of selling $400 networking cards.’ PAGE"
NWS NWS-A98-004 -0.22 "In the US, workers can now lose their jobs through drug tests. Will the same procedure be introduced here? Richie Denenberg reports Putting jobs on the line. BUILDING work on a new county jail in Florida was falling woefully behind schedule, despite the critical need for additional space to house the many arrested as suspected drug offenders. Pressed to account for the delay, an embarrassed local official explained that the project was lagging because too few construction workers could pass the drug test required of all job seekers. The Florida county's ironic predicament illustrates the extent to which drug testing is relied upon by some US employers to screen the workforce. The growing propensity to sample bodily fluids for contraband chemicals has engendered a bitter legal struggle over an employee's right of privacy, a conflict which could spread to Europe along with fear of ‘crack.’ For many workers, the ability to survive a drug test, most commonly a urinalysis for illicit chemicals such as cannabis and cocaine, is becoming a prerequisite to getting and holding a job. On orders from the White House, perhaps as many as a million federal government emloyees are now subject to testing. Wielding its regulatory stick, Washington is compelling the aviation, rail and trucking industries to test thousands of pilots, train crews and lorry drivers. A survey by the US Department of Labor revealed that about a fifth of private-sector workers, mainly employees of large corporations, are already subject to testing. Job applicants are spurned if they register ‘positive’ on a test, often without learning the reason for their rejection. Successful applicants may be subjected to surprise random testing once they are hired -names of those who must provide a urine specimen are picked in a computerised lottery. Others are tested when an industrial accident occurs, on the theory that it creates a ‘reasonable suspicion’ of drug impairment, even though faulty equipment or poor weather conditions may more plausibly account for the mishap. Still others are tested if they apply for promotion to positions which are deemed ‘sensitive.’ Refusing to be tested or coming up positive usually results in immediate sacking. Many unfair dismissal hearings centre on the arcane testimony of forensic chemists, toxicologists and psychopharmacologists (specialists in mood-altering substances). The testing boom has been resisted vigorously by civil liberties groups and trade unions, who view this aspect of the ‘war on drugs’ as a frontal assault on a worker's dignity and entitlement to due process. The obligation to urinate on demand offends many employees, particularly when an offical monitor — given the Orwellian title of ‘Collection Site Person’ in government regulations — stands by to guard against deceptive practices. Urine advertised as free of detectable drugs is on offer by mail-order to anxious test takers, who could try to substitute it for their own. Last spring, the US Supreme Court dealt the unions a blow by ruling, in a suit brought by treasury employees and rail workers, that for critical occupations (such as a customs agent) testing does not curtail constitutional rights. Applying a balancing test, the court held that the danger posed by drug abuse outweighed the individual's expectation of privacy. Despite that setback, opponents strive to contain the spread of testing through further litigation. An argument often made in their briefs, against random testing in particular, is that it reverses the normal presumption of innocence: an employee is deemed guilty unless he can prove himself innocent by producing ‘clean’ urine. Unlike the familiar blood alcohol tests in motoring cases, urinalysis does not demonstrate that the employee is impaired by drugs. It merely detects residues of drugs ingested as much as weeks in the past, when the worker may well have been off-duty or on holiday. An official of the American Civil Liberties Union has protested: ‘Firing people who come to work sober because of their condition on Saturday night is of debatable value.’ The civil libertarians argue that testing permits the employer to delve deeply into an employee's personal life; a specimen can be analysed, without the subject's knowledge, to reveal confidential medical conditions, such as epilepsy or pregnancy. Drug testing also may disproportionally victimise members of racial minority groups whose subcultures sanction casual marijuana smoking, reversing much of the progress that has been made in eliminating employment discrimination. AKEY ISSUE in the litigation is the accuracy of the analytical technology. Testing has created a gold rush for the ‘diagnostics industry’, the largely unregulated private laboratories in which boxes of specimen jars, resembling crates of milk bottles, are processed in assembly-line fashion. Errors sometimes occur, in part because an innocuous substance may trigger a positive. Poppy seeds sprinkled on bread as a flavouring have a disconcerting tendency to react chemically in the same way as the extract of the opium poppy, so that a worker could be mistaken for a heroin user because of what he ate for breakfast. The government's own Center for Disease Control discovered serious reporting errors when quality verification samples were posted to a number of laboratories as an experiment. Although the government has since promulgated guidelines to standardise analytical methods, doubts remain about whether laboratories can be relied upon not to make technical and clerical mistakes which could result in someone's discharge. When mistakes are made, they can prompt complex law suits. An electricity generating company in California sued a laboratory which failed to properly document its analysis; the company was trying to recover from the laboratory the costs of settling a suit for unfair dismissal brought by an employee who lost her job because of the test. Appearing as witnesses in court, some physicians have suggested that it is foolhardy to jeopardise a person's livelihood because of a laboratory report when the worker appears to be performing his job normally. No doctor would order surgery or other treatment on the basis of a single test result, they point out, without corroborating clinical evidence. Job-related performance testing, such as use of flight simulators to check the condition of pilots, has been suggested as a preferable substitute for the drug hunt. There is a theory that even if drug testing is flawed, it at least deters drug use. Yet addiction specialists scoff at the notion that someone who already faces death through overdose or through contracting Aids from hypodermic needles is likely to change his behavour because of a drug test. And, although the Supreme Court upheld testing of customs agents, a few members of the bench doubted that a drug-imbibing agent would be deterred by a test if he was not already fearful, as one put it, that he ‘may be shot dead in unequal combat with unimpaired smugglers.’ TESTING for a short list of illicit drugs has been labelled as myopic, since the working population as a whole tends to abuse a vast pharmacopoeia of legal but impairing substances, many of them heavily promoted by distilleries and pharmaceutical firms. A consumer group recently forced the withdrawal of a medical advertisement which invited doctors to prescribe tranquilizers for air traffic controllers suffering from job stress as they pore over their radar scopes. The addiction specialists urge that the emphasis be shifted to eliminating underlying conditions, such as job stress and tedium, against which workers often seek to medicate themselves. Rather than focusing on a few substances which are painted in lurid colours, the specialists say, the goal should be a workplace free of compulsive chemical use of all kinds. Since testing is typically used not to facilitate treatment of addicted workers but to sack them — a process sardonically referred to as ‘dismissal therapy’— the upshot could be a ‘recriminalisation’ of addiction. That would undo decades of effort to have chemical dependency recognised as a treatable disorder rather than as a moral lapse deserving of punishment. Even though drug testing has attracted the most controversy, it is merely part of a broad movement in America toward a Darwinian worker-selection policy, which has been dubbed ‘employment of the fittest.’ Employees are routinely subjected to psychological screening and polygraph tests to evaluate their honesty. Character is probed by handwriting analysts. Genetic screening, to determine if the worker's chromosomes render him vulnerable to occupational illness, looms on the horizon. Multiple layers of screening, much of it of dubious scientific validity, may become a routine feature of working life unless restraints are imposed by law, as some states have begun to do. While it approved some types of drug testing, the Supreme Court did leave the anti-testing forces a glimmer of hope for ultimate legal containment. It held that in principle a drug test is a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights. Since the amendment bans ‘unreasonable searches and seizures,’ the possibility remains that a test may be found unreasonable if the job is so non-critical that public needs fail to outweigh individual privacy interests. Drug testing opponents may also take comfort from the surprising dissent by arch-conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. He disparaged the customs service testing programme as mere display, a gesture of solidarity with the President's anti-drug campaign. Sacrificing civil liberties, Justice Scalia sneered, ‘cannot be the means of making a point.’ R. V. Denenberg, a former editor at the New York Times, is the author of Understanding American Politics (Fontana Press).

NWS NWS-AHC-082 -0.17 "Village Voice: The times they are a-changin' By Byron Rogers I GET mugged twice a year. Each time the effect is the same; confusion followed by a peering at familiar things, then an inventory to work out what went this time. Last Sunday I sat in a cold room with my daughter, the two of us reviling the malign fate which had robbed us of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, our weekly TV fix. I shall never get used to the changing of the clocks. Like middle age, this takes me unawares, for even when I have noticed that single paragraph on the front page of newspapers, I still can't work out what is happening. I lie awake, trying to remember whether the clocks go forward or back, and what this means in terms of daylight or the day before. All I know, like the protestors when the Julian became the Gregorian calendar, is that I must have missed something. Either the afternoons are as endless as those in old folks' homes, which prompt the matrons to pin up Reality Orientation charts (’ When is your birthday? What are the names of your children?’), or night comes so abruptly it is as though someone has pulled down a blind. Whatever happens, I always seem to end up watching The South Bank Show, something I never do normally; the changing of the clocks is forever associated with the Arts and adenoids. I know there are other irreconcilables out there somewhere. My father told me of an old lady who to the end of her days referred to ‘Amser Duw ac amser Lloyd George,’ God's time and Lloyd George's time, for when the change was introduced during the Great War, there was chaos. The towns accepted the new time, but not the country areas. Farmers argued that as their day already began at sunrise, they would gain nothing and would also lose an hour for their workers insisted on finishing at the same time as town dwellers. They refused to alter their clocks. So in the same village, there would be two different sorts of time. Post offices, railway stations and schools had the new, and the rest the old; in the cottages there was friction as children and their fathers turned up for meals at different times. The women, as usual, bore the brunt of it, for everyone stayed up late, children refused to go to bed at night and men would not get up in the morning. It must have been the most bewildering social change since the Enclosures, and yet I can find no reference to it in the village School Log. Of course they got used to it, just as they got used to the closing of the railway, the death of the last squire, the demolition of the hall, the theft of the common land. The story of a village is, contrary to popular belief, one of continual change. Which is why I find myself brooding over an extraordinary view taken from the air. Such photographs are very popular, and Parish Clerk Weekley has one which shows him sitting on his own roof. Usually they get taken from 100ft up, but the one I have is a little different. It was taken 300 miles up, from a satellite. A town like Towcester is a little larger than my thumbnail, the M1 is a hairline fracture, and the only piece of geometry anywhere is the remorseless straight line, seen from space, of the old Roman Watling Street. The scale is 1–75,000, the photograph is 20 ins by 16 inches, and its detail amazing. I can see fields and reservoirs and a motorway service station, and, given the proper magnification, I could probably make out Parish Clerk Weekley still on his roof waiting for his next photocall. Until I was lent this, I had not realised it was possible for members of the public to get their hands on such things. You buy them from the Nigel Press Associates of Edenbridge in Kent; a print this size costs £60. This presumably restricts their popularity, especially as no farmer is going to want one when his yard is the size of a blackhead. Yet apparently members of the public are beginning to buy these pictures, which were previously bought only by geologists and oil companies. I think they do so for peace of mind. For this is the earth as no bird has ever seen it, and no man from any plane. In this small picture, you look down on a couple of hundred thousand people and their bodies are as invisible as microbes. You are as distant from their worries and their rows as any angel. Look, you can just make out their bypasses and their parks, their racecourses and their research establishments. At this height the street plans of their towns look like writhing maggots, and a puff of cloud conceals an entire farm. All human activity seems so petty. You can forgive them anything from this perspective; you can almost forgive them for changing the clocks."
NWS NWS-AJF-005 -0.31 "The Arts: Suitable subjects to sing about? Charles Manson, terrorists and Steve Biko feature in new operas. Geoffrey Wheatcroft wonders if murder strikes quite the right note By GEOFFREY WHEATCROFT IN DR JOHNSON's all too familiar phrase, opera is an exotic and irrational entertainment. Is it becoming more irrational and exotic than it can handle? Several recent or forthcoming operas sound as if they were designed for — or perhaps by — what in Soho are known as people of strange and unusual tastes. These works raise a serious question as to whether their subjects are suitable cases for treatment — that is, by librettists and composers. The Death of Klinghoffer, with music (if that's the word) by John Adams, had its European premiere in Brussels last year. It is based on a real-life episode of seven years ago: the murder of an elderly Jewish-American tourist on a Mediterranean cruise ship by Palestinian terrorists. Next month sees the world premiere in Birmingham of Biko, by Priti Paintal and Richard Fawkes. And now comes John Moran's opera, The Manson Family. This work was commissioned by the Lincoln Center in New York for its Serious Fun! festival and performed recently with the composer himself playing the mass murderer, whose victims included the actress Sharon Tate. Now opera has rarely been a naturalistic medium, and never an understated one. For more than its first hundred years, in the 17th and 18th centuries, its stories were all set in classical antiquity. Some were based on historical fact — L'Incoronazione di Poppea, Giulio Cesare — but most were mythological. And the most outre modern librettist makes no advance in terms of weirdness or bloodthirstiness on these tales: have a look at the story of Orfeo or Idomeneo, human sacrifice and all. The great advance in Mozart's time was operas set in the here and now. Some of these were again off-beat or disturbing: the stories of Cos fan tutte and Fidelio are both shocking in their way, though both are supposedly based on real life. In the early 19th century, the historical opera was reborn in Italy under the impact of the Romantic movement, Schiller's plays and Scott's poems and novels. Despite the way these are sometimes now staged, these ottocento operas were meant to be taken seriously. And they dealt with gruesome subjects. One of the very first of them was Rossini's Elisabetta Regina d'Inghilterra, which revolves around a real enough subject: the execution of what might now be called political prisoners. Verdi's Don Carlos — just opened at the ENO in a fine new production — contains an auto-da-fe scene. And Wagner's operas are in a class of their own: blood, thunder, and a sex scene in which a chap gets off with his sister. And yet we are shocked — we are certainly meant to be — by ‘daring’ contemporary operas. The ENO's stagings of Henze's The Bassarids (still more classical mythology with Bacchic orgies and killings) and Greek by Mark Anthony Turnage (with a foul-mouthed, violent libretto after Steven Berkoff) would fall into this category. ENO is distressed that ‘opera has not generally been the property of the youngest type of creative talent’. And so it has now set its ‘education and outreach’ department ‘to encourage young people from across Britain to use their music and song to tell their stories’. The New Visions, New Voices initiative is restricted to ‘anyone under 30’. But among the oldies who have given the project their support are Malcolm McLaren and Elvis Costello, which suggests that the ENO is looking for something a little off the beaten operatic track, not to say strange and unusual. These strange and unusual subjects may be relevant — but will they be ‘suitable’? As I wrote on this page recently, opera is barely a living art form any longer. The living ‘opera’ of today is arguably the musical. Until not long ago that form, too, had its conventions, and on the whole steered clear of ‘unsuitable’ or even grown-up subjects. There were exceptions, again, like Carousel, which is being revived at the National Theatre later this year, and which has a plot bizarre by Verdi's standards. Then came Sondheim. His shows are serious and grown-up, by his lights, and they certainly have storylines so odd as to make The Ring look like a sit-com. Sondheim's latest New York musical, due here in the autumn, is The Assassins. One of its characters from real life is Squeaky Fromme, she who tried to assassinate President Gerald Ford, who sings a duet with John Warnock Hinckley, the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan. And Squeaky, it may be remembered, was a member of the Manson ‘family’… It might say something about the Americans that they remain so obsessed with this repellent, perverted killer and his pathetic entourage. But it may say something also about the condition of the musical theatre that this subject has caught the attention of two composers. In the end, no subject is too serious for opera to treat, or necessarily too unpleasant, or too poignant. What matters is how it is handled. Perhaps the most unbearably poignant opera of the last half-century is The Emperor of Atlantis, which was written in Theresianstadt concentration camp, while composer and librettist waited to be sent to Auschwitz. The poignancy of that piece is the circumstance of its composition, not its subject matter. An opera set in the camps would be a very different thing. There are, after all, considerations of taste or, if that's too namby-pamby, of simple decency. Of course, the subject can be dramatic and terrible. Steve Biko, a brave and remarkable man who met a tragic death in the course of a patriotic struggle: this is the very stuff of opera. Any number of romantic operas likewise deal with patriotic heroes, from Rossini's William Tell, just revived at the Royal Opera, to Smetana's Dalibor (which is due for a revival). But it all depends on the treatment. This is what is wrong with Klinghoffer. The murdered tourist left a widow whose permission was not asked before the work was written. Adams was the composer of the ‘minimalist’ score (which means that its musical content is minimal), and his librettist was Alice Goodman, but its begetter was the ubiquitous director Peter Sellars, whose work is clever, gifted, silly and camp. There was indeed something rebarbative — as there may prove to be about The Manson Family when and if we see it on stage here — about the use of a serious story for a work which struck many as frivolous and even posturing. Opera can take almost, if not quite, any subject and make something worthwhile of it. What matters is the making."
NWS NWS-AL0-005 -0.17 "The Arts: Beating the colour barrier One rarely sees a black swan in classical ballet. Why? Nadine Meisner visits a Royal Ballet project that is encouraging a different sort of child to put on pointed shoes By NADINE MEISNER TWENTY more or less innocent little faces looked at the pianist and the two teachers and chanted: ‘Thank you Mary, thank you Brenda, thank you Michael.’ Wonderfully neat in their red and black practice clothes, they had gone through the rigours of a simplified ballet barre (with varying degrees of stoicism), a mime sequence (much enthusiasm) and foot-stretching exercises (giggles and pretend moans). Now they were in the end-of-class ritual of thanks, part of ballet's insistence on grace not only of body but also of spirit. Hundreds of ballet classes exist up and down the country, but this one, in Shepherd's Bush, west London, is special: many of the children are black. It is part of a Royal Ballet project called A Chance to Dance, designed to stimulate an interest in ballet, principally but not exclusively among black children, in deprived areas. Over two years the children get free weekly training and dancewear. The scheme was launched last autumn by the company's education officer, Darryl Jaffray, for absolute beginners aged between seven and nine. With the help of two London boroughs, Hammersmith and Fulham and Lambeth, 2,000 children from 16 schools auditioned for approximately 25 places in each borough. But why the scheme? ‘I had been aware,’ Jaffray says, ‘that there were more people with potential for ballet than ever considered entering a ballet class.’ Ballet is essentially a middle-class interest, the domain of white little girls whose parents can afford the fees. A Chance to Dance aims to encourage children of all ethnic groups and social backgrounds. Jaffray started by targeting boroughs with a high black population (although the children were subsequently selected purely on merit). The classes certainly do not mirror what you see on the British ballet stage, especially at the Royal Ballet. In the total absence of black dancers, Covent Garden lags behind other ballet companies in the West. It admits that remarkably few black students have passed through its school. Yet the modern-dance stage presents a different picture. Look at a troupe like London Contemporary Dance Theatre: its numbers are tiny by ballet standards, but they have always included black dancers. None too soon, the Royal Ballet has decided to take notice. A Chance to Dance is a step towards producing students trained to the company's standards and style. Children usually have a strong ballet grounding long before they apply to enter the Royal Ballet School from the age of 11. So the group at Shepherd's Bush has a way to go before some of them might be deemed fit to audition there or at other vocational schools. But they have made startling progress since they started last November. Tummies have flattened, shoulders have straightened. ‘To point your right foot to the side, transfer your weight to the left,’ their teacher Brenda Garratt-Glassman tells them. ‘And don't look at your feet, it distorts your posture.’ Their other teacher, Michael Moore, walks round adjusting bodies, whispering reminders. Both teachers are black, former members of Dance Theatre of Harlem, the American black ballet company. They are also English. They are living evidence of the past lack of opportunity for black classical dancers in this country. The barrier has held back both sides. Not only have ballet companies tended to overlook black dancers, but black dancers, observing the prevailing whiteness, have discarded ballet ambitions. The Royal Opera House elicits the greatest suspicion. ‘It does scare people off,’ admits the Royal Ballet's director, Anthony Dowell. ‘Even a lot of white people sometimes feel it is a no-go area. But I hope that we will widen the net with this project so that people won't be scared to come forward.’ But there has been a gradual shift in attitudes within this bastion of British ballet. The dancer Evan Williams joined the Royal Ballet's sister company, the Birmingham Royal Ballet, two years ago, the third in a succession of black recruits to that troupe. Having started dancing on the advice of a PE teacher, he was accepted at 16 into the Royal Ballet Upper School, the only black student there. He had auditioned on his own stubborn initiative, although people had warned him that because of his colour he was wasting his time. So why did he succeed? ‘I think the timing has a lot to do with it. Probably doors were closed in the past. People said black dancers don't have the right body, the right feet. And black dancers had gone in for contemporary or modern dance because they had felt ballet to be a white art form to be watched by white people.’ It goes even deeper than that. Ballet simply does not figure in black or working-class lives; such children tend to go into dance through rock music, reggae, discos — and that means modern dance. For that reason Jaffray considered it important to provide concrete images of ballet performances. ‘It struck us that these children hadn't really had a chance to see what ballet was.’ Parents have been invited to an open day at the Royal Opera House which includes a back-stage tour, as well as dance and make-up sessions. In July, the children will be taken to watch a performance of La Fille mal gardee, judiciously chosen for its humour. ‘We want their first performance to be a real knock-out,’ Jaffray says. She is equally keen that they should have black role-models. So it is no accident that the teachers are black; or that she enlisted the active help of Dance Theatre of Harlem. Two of their members, alongside Jaffray and the Covent Garden ballerina Fiona Chadwick, presented lecture-demonstrations to children and families before the auditions last October. And over recent months, Dance Theatre of Harlem principals have been guesting at Covent Garden; one of these, Virginia Johnson, took part in a Shepherd's Bush class. Prejudices take time to crumble. (None is more rock-like than the attitude to men in ballet; several of the boys in the Shepherd's Bush class have left because of teasing.) But when Covent Garden does put black dancers on its payroll, what then? Will they feature as the attendants and train-bearers of the classics or in ‘special’ roles, such as the Moor in Petrushka? Or shall we see black faces among a row of white swans? Dowell is adamant it will be the second option: ‘As young dancers they would start and be used in the corps like everybody else.’ The old uniformity is no more and we will be all the richer for it."
NWS NWS-CBE-123 -0.29 "Butchered safari girls' battled for life Bob Graham, in Nine Mile Reef, South Africa THE last desperate moments in the lives of murdered British tourists Julie Godwin and Elizabeth Over were revealed here last night. Detailed police forensic work uncovered how the two young women — best friends on a holiday together — fought frantically to save themselves from slaughter. Their attackers hacked them to pieces with hundreds of blows from a 3ft panga sugar cane knife and a foot-long bush knife. Detectives are convinced 30-year-old Elizabeth battled bravely for her life and tried to escape by fleeing in her boyfriend's four-wheel-drive truck. She was butchered at the wheel of the vehicle by her attacker who hung through the passenger window, repeatedly slicing her with the panga. Her vain escape bid lasted less than 60ft and a few nightmare seconds, before she crashed the white Isuzu van into a ditch in a haze of blood and pain. Even as she died her foot stayed on the accelerator, leaving the wheels spinning in the white sand to carve out a 2ft deep hole. Her companion Julie, also 30, at the start of a holiday from her home in Northampton, tried to run. But she died the same merciless death at the remote nature reserve on the Indian Ocean, 220 miles north of Durban — repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces. Julie fell dead beneath a tree, its lower branches hacked off in the frenzied attack. South African detectives yesterday combed the entire deserted coastline area for clues in the hunt for the killers. Accompanied by TODAY, Detective Sergeant Louis Van der Merwe and Detective Sergeant Riaan Render gathered up gruesome pointers to the two young women's life-and-death struggle. In the fine white sand, the pools of dark blood stains stood out in stark contrast to the natural beauty of the coast. Close to the tree was a shattered tumbler, which police believe Elizabeth used to try to defend herself. A vital thumb print, which they discovered was not Elizabeth's, has been taken from it. In an intensive hunt thousands of Zulus on the nature reserve are to be fingerprinted. ‘Make no mistake, we will find the killers,’ said Detective Sergeant Render. ‘No matter what it takes and how long we have to investigate it we will find out who did it.’ A post mortem yesterday at the Natal State Mortuary in Durban revealed that both women died from multiple wounds from the panga and bush knives. The Chief State pathologist, Professor Jan Botha, could not determine just how many stab wounds they had suffered — he said he lost count. The examination also revealed that both women were dead before being dragged across the beach and dumped into the ocean. Professor Botha also said neither woman had been raped, although he added that further tests are to be conducted on the bodies. Elizabeth, who is originally from St Albans, Herts, discovered the remote area, world-renowned for snorkelling, diving and fishing, with her South African fiance Cuan Cronje, several months ago. After she moved to Durban in February to be with her boyfriend, she vowed she would show the beautiful region to Julie, her best friend from college days. Despite the striking natural beauty of the national parkland's hundreds of miles of beaches, rich in wildlife from crocodiles to hippos, it is an area many white South Africans will no longer visit. They fear that increasing raids from bordering Mozambique just a few miles away, together with the lack of any local security, has turned the area into a no-go zone. Although many white South Africans carry guns for security, the only protection Elizabeth and Julie carried on their five-day trip was a can of CS Gas. Detectives believe that Elizabeth managed to grab the canister, but it was wrenched from her grasp. Her bloodstained finger marks still cover its side. The motive for the slaughter is now believed to be robbery. Police know that on Saturday — two days before the murders — Julie cashed £340 in travellers cheques and carried the 1,500 South African rand in her wallet. Elizabeth's distraught fiance Cuan, who visited the murder scene on Wednesday, told police the money was missing, together with two tyre pumps. The attackers ignored a valuable camera and both women's credit cards. The full horror of the attack was revealed yesterday by the bloody scene inside the white van. Inside the rear compartment, the blood covered everything. A foam mattress was still saturated and a bottle of Johnson's Baby Sun Block was unreadable because of the blood. A Marie Claire magazine horoscope supplement lay in a puddle of blood, which had trickled down into small pools in the sand. Everywhere the white sides of the van and its tailgate were splattered. Detective Sergeant Render said: ‘It is sickening that human beings have done this to two innocent young women. ‘This is more than just a robbery, it is so frenzied and angry, the work of animals, that it is beyond the comprehension of the human mind.’ The officers believe Elizabeth and Julie had been sunbathing naked on the remote beach, confident they would not be seen. Although there are rumours among local Zulus that the two women were seen earlier that day with two black men, police have not been able to confirm the reports. The only witness who saw the women on the beach is another tourist, a South African businessman named Ockert Cameron. He told police that shortly before 6pm on Monday he spotted them sunbathing naked, but did not go near. When he returned 30 minutes later he saw their truck in a ditch, and both women gone."
NWS NWS-CFC-175 -0.29 "Hell on earth for war rape victims Captive forced by attackers to lick her own blood EVIDENCE is emerging that thousands of women have been systematically and brutally raped in the conflict in former Yugoslavia. CHARLOTTE ADCOCK spoke to a woman who has interviewed some of the victims. (Readers may find parts of this account upsetting) R ape in warfare has often been overlooked. Widely considered a routine, if regrettable, fact of war, it has rarely been prosecuted. Reports on the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia, however, suggest not only that rape and the sexual abuse of women have been carried out on a massive scale, but that it has been systematic and organised. Evidence is now emerging that women have been detained in order to be raped and even impregnated, and that political and military leaders knew, but condoned it.One woman who can testify to the existence of rape camps and the suffering of women, is Francoise Hampson, senior lecturer at Essex University and an expert in the law of armed conflict. She has just returned from interviewing rape victims in Bosnia during a nine-day mission led by the International League of Human Rights.While European Community officials estimate 20,000 women have been raped, Francoise Hampson says quantification is impossible. ‘The only value in the figures is the indication of the scale and an adjective would be better. The word I would pick is ‘widespread’.’ Human rights organisations remain wary of publishing figures because they have been widely used as propaganda. Amnesty International has, however, released details of individual accounts to ‘illustrate at least part of what has occurred’. The accounts include those of Moslems from Kljuc. One mother described how her daughter was locked up and she was raped by three drunk, uniformed men whom she knew. Another woman in her mid-sixties said she had been one of eight raped by ‘Serbian irregulars’. ‘Three of them raped her, one first forced his hand into her at knifepoint and then made her lick her own blood. Two of the women had their throats slit after the rapes,’ the report states.Victims have been assaulted in different situations, said Ms Hampson. Women have been randomly raped by individuals, gang-raped by uniformed men, and raped in detention centres either by the guards or people let in by the guards. There has also been a high incidence of murder following rape.Allegations have to be handled with care, but there is clear evidence that rape camps have been set up. ‘I interviewed someone from a rape camp in Doboj. It was unequivocally a place where women were held in order to be raped,’ she said.Observers have also identified a specific category of women raped in order to be made pregnant. Rape has happened on all sides and across the sexes, but according to Ms Hampson ‘the overwhelming majority of the rape victims are non-Serbs’. Several factors have made the abuse particularly cruel and degrading. ‘The fact that it's so systematic, going effectively unpunished and often performed by people known to the victims makes it more horrific. It's been made even more humiliating by the circumstances in which it's been done like public rape. ‘In no case where we interviewed had the woman only been raped by one man. Plenty of them had only been raped over one period of 24 hours but never less than by six or seven men. Two women passed out when raped by number three so they don't know.’ The effect on women, in a Moslem culture which perhaps considers rape more dishonourable than murder, has been profound. Victims have been openly accused by their husbands of being ‘Chetnik whores’. Some have been abandoned by their families and others forced to leave. ‘There isn't even guaranteed support from other women because it's seen as so shameful. Some haven't told their mothers. They believe they know and look at them differently, and it's avoided as a topic of conversation.’ Resources are scarce, medical treatment limited and abortions not always available. Many victims are also having to come to terms with the trauma while looking after children and the elderly in overcrowded refugee camps.Whether rape has been singled out by military commanders as a weapon of war remains open to question, but victims' testimony suggests the abuse is part of a wider pattern of warfare and ‘ethnic cleansing’. Ms Hampson believes the abuse is more than an incidental or sexual act. It is clearly being used as an instrument to achieve a military purpose. ‘People aren't raping for rape's sake. In some instances where villages are being ‘cleansed’, rape is being used to terrorize and humiliate communities.’ There is evidence that rape, regarded as good for morale, increased after a military setback and that peer group pressure is strong. ‘Clearly the authorities know the rape camps are there and what they're being used for. A lot of people who haven't previously raped must be going around raping.’ She admits in the final analysis she finds it difficult to make sense of the ‘gratuitous savagery’. ‘I'm left with extremely uncomfortable questions about what makes men tick and I don't see any reason to believe that men in the former Yugoslavia are different from men elsewhere. ‘That doesn't mean I think all men are rapists but…it means a significant proportion of the men around us in that situation of social breakdown would rape and I can't even begin to digest that notion.’ What she is clear about is that rape is a war crime and ought to be prosecuted. Rape clearly contravenes international law and she cites the 1907 Hague Conventions, the '49 Geneva Conventions and the '77 Protocols to make her point. It is not new laws that are required but enforcement of existing ones, she says.The International League is now calling for effective individual accountability for serious violations of the law and the creation of a war crimes tribunal. ‘Reconciliation requires a coming to terms with the past not its burial or denial,’ it states."
NWS NWS-CH3-224 -0.1 "My sacking hurt me, my family and my friends like hell PHIL THOMPSON ON THE CRISIS AT LIVERPOOL NEIL SILVER PHIL Thompson last night described the torment of his sacking by Liverpool. In a frank debate on the Anfield crisis on Sky TV Thompson, former Liverpool skipper and coach, told how his shock sacking had shattered his family. ‘It hurt me, it hurt my family and friends like hell,’ said Thompson. ‘And I've not been given a good reason for it.’ Thompson was backed by former hard-man Liverpool colleague Tommy Smith, who said Thompson should have been given a medal for what he did at Anfield, not the sack. Here is the amazing transcript of the debate, on The Footballers' Football Show, which also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrenson, and which was hosted by presenter Richard Keys. Debate We pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisions. BRIAN HALL: ‘At that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cup, he's got the opportunity of reaching Wembley, he's had a difficult time in the League, it's been a traumatic season okay, then he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39. ‘There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solid, rational decisions. I don't think so under those sort of circumstances.’ TOMMY SMITH: ‘So you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five seconds?’ HALL: ‘No, what I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologised, he's made apologies. I think we ought to make some understanding of the sort of pressures that the man was under at the time when all this happened, and it happened very quickly.’ PHIL THOMPSON: ‘So that mean's I get my job back does it?’ RICHARD KEYS: ‘We should explain that too. Phil, you were on the coaching staff and left in the summer. ‘I understand you've got a legal problem which means we can't go too deeply into that, but from the outside is it hurting you a little bit?’ THOMPSON: ‘It hurts like hell. Reasons for my dismissal were nothing like I think I deserved. I think it lies a little bit deeper.’ SMITH: ‘I think the lad deserved a medal, because they won the Cup with half a reserve side out last year — and he was taking care of the reserves.’ THOMPSON: ‘All I've just said is that it was not a good enough explanation of what I got and I don't think anybody has been told, not only to the media out there, myself who is the most important one. ‘But it hurt me, my family and my friends like hell. And I've not had a good enough reason why — that's all I'm hurting Brian, I don't think that is taking anything too far.’ KEYS: ‘Mark, somewhat distanced from it now, what's you're impression of what's happening at Anfield.’ MARK LAWRENSON: ‘I think the thing you have to say Richard, they've only played eight games. This has happened before and no matter what people say I think in my second year we were about 16th or 17th.’ KEYS: ‘But it is not just a question of what is going on on the park, it's what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previously, ever. LAWRENSON: ‘No but I honestly believe that there are certain members of the Press that are delighted to have a go at Liverpool because of the success that they've had. ‘They are a victim of their own success. It has been absolutely phenomenal, it really has, and now all of a sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the stories. ‘How many games are there left? 34? You know, I don't think he (Souness) has been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been there. ‘So I think it is a bit early to pre-empt things.’ Souness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian club. SMITH: ‘Souness seems to be changing an awful lot. If he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then great, but so far it hasn't been that successful. ‘I know that Liverpool won the FA Cup — thanks to Phil and his reserves, because most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuries. ‘There's a big question mark about how Liverpool train. They go on pasta diets now. If food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 years. ‘An awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly club.’ THOMPSON: ‘The thing with Bill Shankly was that we were always a family and everyone knew each other from the cleaning lady to the girls in the ticket office. It was something special.’ PHIL Thompson is still bitter at the way he was treated at Anfield. SMITH: ‘Thompson deserved medal’ LAWRENSON: ‘Too early to judge’ SOUNESS: Upset some Anfield fans"
NWS NWS-K4Y-054 -0.1 "CHRISTOPHER Gable says he did not set out to deliberately shock. Yet he was well aware that tampering with the traditional approach to Swan Lake would ruffle a few feathers. What he wasn't expecting was a Sunday newspaper preview article claiming Northern Ballet Theatre's new staging of Swan Lake was steamy, erotic stuff with a hint of oral sex. More dirty duck than sensual swan was the impression given. The result of this advance publicity not wildly accurate as it turns out spelt potential disaster for NBT which prides itself on making its work more accessible to youngsters. Worried parents fretted that their children would be exposed to X-rated happenings. A Darlington councillor who, of course, hadn't seen the production called for it to be banned. The threat of cancelled bookings hung in the air. Backstage at Leeds Grand Theatre, a few days after Swan Lake's royal premiere elicited a five-minute standing ovation from the audience, Gable talks long and intelligently about the controversial production. You'd expect the unhelpful advance publicity to make him wary of the Press. Not at all. He has operated an ‘open door’ policy since taking over as NBT's artistic director and will continue to do so. If people are going to have their opinions formed by what they read in the tabloids, he feels sorry for them. A relatively simple question like ‘Are you a happy man?’(one assumes he must be in the wake of the successful opening) is followed by a 15 minute answer. Gable replies that to be honest he's surprised, although not by the attitude of ‘the old guard conservative group of three or four London reviewers’. Their reaction was predictable: ‘One expects them to groan, though I don't know quite why we should be seeing a piece as it was performed 50 years ago. That's what they think ballet should be and that's why I think, by and large, ballet is a dying art form.’ What has surprised and pleased him is the public's response. He wasn't sure how they'd take to this rethink of Swan Lake. From the letters he's received and through talking to audiences, he knows the production is a popular one. Just don't use the word ‘crowd-pleaser’. Gable regards this as an insult to the audience handed out by critics who consider themselves on a higher level. That NBT audiences and critics are out of touch would seem to be borne out by the response to NBT's recent touring hit Romeo & Juliet. Worst production of the year, wrote one London critic. Best of the year, voted readers of Dance and Dancers. ‘I was not sure what the general public's reaction would be to Swan Lake. Everyone knows the name and thinks they know the story. I presumed they would be bringing very formed expectations to the theatre. ‘What I've found is a far younger element in the audience. On the evidence this production is speaking far more vividly to this generation than the traditional version.’ Gable hopes his Swan Lake will be viewed not as a version but a theatre event in its own right. ‘Although I don't try to shock I do try to make the moment as vividly alive for the audience as I can and that's a sort of crusade,’ he admits. He's moved the story to Russia, sent the Prince on army manoeuvres where he joins a boys' boozy night out, has the swans massacred by a power-mad crippled usurper and the corpses piled obscenely in a heap. Worst of all, the swans don't wear tutus but rather fetching white corseted little skirts. NBT audiences are ‘not content to look at rows and rows of identical girls doing the same thing,’ he maintains. Gable justifies his changes with talk of Tiananmen Square killings, the murder of the Russian royal family, Auschwitz, Hollywood parties and even Prince Andrew. This may sound extreme in print but Gable considers it ‘legitimate stuff of the theatre.’ He says: ‘I simply tried to do what I observed in my career in the straight theatre with some of the finest directors, particularly Peter Brook. ‘I tried to make the story as individual and as real as I can, and if possible to approach without any preconceptions, which is hard with Swan Lake because I have been associated with the ballet for 14 years. ‘You can't just make a performance of everything you have seen. You have to clear away the debris. I did with this, looking at various segments of the story.’ He's proud that Romeo & Juliet introduced children to both Shakespeare and Prokofiev ‘in a way that makes them think it's not culture and a bit boring and I wish I could go and watch Neighbours.’ Christopher the Crusader is in his stride, the man who reckons this generation of youngsters is deprived. They may have more toys, games and TVs per room than any other generation but lack the stimulation of reading, listening to music and the radio of Gable's youth. ‘It seems to me that what our children have got is a little square box with predominantly soaps and games shows, with fingertip control to get them from one to another as they get bored. There is no stimulus for the imagination and like any other muscle it can atrophy from lack of use.’ Gable is honest enough to acknowledge that there's some truth in the saying that no publicity is bad publicity: ‘The cynical and worldly part of me tells me it's been wonderful because the production must be the most talked about in 20 years of dance. ‘Once the production opened and the showed the allegations were totally groundless we are left with a production that parents know is suitable for children and no one can take that publicity away.’ — Swan Lake plays at Darlington Civic Theatre from March 31-April 4 and Newcastle Theatre Royal in June."
NWS NWS-K5C-093 -0.28 "A criminal tendency to apportion blame Increasing violence has led society to root out scapegoats, but new research in Scotland suggests that those fingered don't fit in the frame, says Mike Wilson MORAL panic is one of the more enduring items on the domestic cultural menu and in a month of fatal stabbings, horrific child murder and economic gloom, society seems once again all too willing to frighten itself to death. And to root out scapegoats. This week's focus is on juvenile delinquents. But not far behind in the firing line are welfare-dependent single-parent families, now so used to being vilified it seems time to offer a blindfold and last cigarette. It is they, say critics, who most accurately reflect the health of the welfare state in the late 20th century: an underclass of the dependent, the criminal and the morally degenerate. But according to research released yesterday, the facts don't quite fit the script. Children of welfare-dependent single-parent families have neither a monopoly on juvenile crime nor a disdain for conventional values. It seems the only thing which divides the underclass from the rest of society is cash. The findings, which will appear later this year as a chapter of a book, are those of Edinburgh University's Richard Kinsey. What they amount to is an appeal for calm. His apparent heresy is not that of the smooth talking cleric, but the statistician specialising in the field of criminology. Crime, Deprivation and the Scottish Urban Environment is a simple exercise in gathering facts, ‘a mapping the contours of crime in Scotland’, says Kinsey. But in a debate often skewed by anecdote and rhetoric, its steady empirical analysis makes it one of the most significant critiques of the underclass to emerge. Kinsey defines the underclass by turning to a bibliography spanning Social Darwinism to Monday's Daily Mail, via Sir Keith Joseph and the US political scientist Charles Murray, published recently in the Sunday Times. ‘Broadly speaking,’ says Kinsey, ‘these writers share the following claims: Firstly, for a section of the population — in practice the unemployed poor — the availability of state benefits provides a basic financial guarantee allowing choices to be made and actions pursued, which previously were unavailable due to the constraints of the labour market. ‘Secondly, the welfare state has unwittingly provided ‘incentives’ for non-participation in work, education and ‘family life’, evidence of which is visible in the rejection of the work ethic, the relaxation of moral standards and the emergence of the ‘dependency culture’. ‘And finally, evidence of the growing underclass is to be found in the increase in single-parent families, the increase in crime, and the lack of attachment to ‘conventional’ values. These ‘symptoms’, it is said, are most prevalent among young people living in poor areas.’ TO test this, Kinsey has analysed the results of one of the biggest surveys of its kind in Europe, consisting of carefully-monitored questions put to 3,500 young people from all walks of life in Edinburgh and the Lothians. If the underclass theorists have got it right, argues Kinsey, then nowhere will it be more apparent than among the children of welfare-dependent single-mother families. It will be they who commit the most crime, it will be they who will stick two fingers up to conventional mores. But the underclass theorists seem to have got it wrong. Young people from welfare-dependent single-parent families just aren't artful dodgers ready to graduate into serious crime and a moral vacuum. Sure, nearly 60 per cent of them admitted committing some sort of crime or incivility in the nine months prior to being questioned. But at 60 per cent offending, such children were being no more criminal — and sometimes considerably less criminal — than their more affluent peers. Such as latch-key kids from middle-class backgrounds. In contrast, in single-parent families where the adult was working, the offending rate shot to 74 per cent. In two-parent families, where no adults were in work, the corresponding figure was 46 per cent, which rose to 55 per cent when one of the adults was in work and 59 per cent when both adults were in work. On the basis of these figures, the issue of juvenile crime seems less to do with welfare dependency, and more to do with after-school child care. Where the findings are even more startling involves the social attitudes of young people. Far from rejecting conventional values — for example towards family relationships, school work and the environment — underclass children expressed higher levels of concern than those from other backgrounds. ‘Of all the groups of young people questioned,’ says the findings, ‘the children of welfare-dependent single mothers consistently recorded the highest levels of anxiety about their prospects for: their future (66 per cent); their school work (75 per cent); other members of their family (88 per cent); personal relationships with others (90 per cent); and even on green issues and the environment (74 per cent).’ SAYS Kinsey: ‘What we have seen in newspaper editorials and in political speeches over a period of time, is a latching on to the problem of crime and a series of assertions about the so-called welfare-dependent underclass. In my view, those arguments are based on very little research, hyperbole and appeal to the most crude stereotypes. And they have become a Trojan Horse to undermine some very basic and strongly-held principles of welfare and the welfare state.’ He is backed by Adrian Sinfield, professor of social policy at Edinburgh University, whose concern is that attacks on the welfare state are being carried out in a climate of increasing economic inequality and worsening poverty. ‘Poverty is increasing and it's being called dependency. Over the last decade, benefits for the unemployed have been cut in some 50 different ways so that the living standards of those out of work have fallen even further behind those of other citizens.’ Since 1950 the number of those unemployed for more than a year has increased from 34,000 to more than a million at the start of this year. According to information just released, only a quarter of the unemployed are supported by a National Insurance benefit, while two thirds are forced to rely on means-tested schemes. If there is to be a debate about welfare benefits, argues Sinfield, it must include the benefits accorded to the well-off, such as mortgage relief. ‘For example, the £10 billion of revenue lost in supporting occupational and personal pensions for the generally better-off must be set alongside the £6 billion spent on means-tested benefits for the poorest old people.’ Richard Kinsey's final warning is that while it would be inappropriate to translate research conducted in Scotland to England, ‘vice versa you cannot generalise from the experience south of the Border to Scotland where we have a very different style of policing, a very different system of juvenile justice and a very different welfare structure.’"
