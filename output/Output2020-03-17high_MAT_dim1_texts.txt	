HOC HOC-MZ 7.25 " I am outraged that they would even consider trying to ban him, what sort of society are we living in people should have the freedom to listen to what they want just like having the freedom of speech if you don't like it don't listen but don't try and impress your views on everyone else this is the 21st century after all. Long live Eminem.      Elizabeth, UK I agree that Eminem's lyrics are shocking but that is exactly what they are supposed to be. Everything he talks about happens every day. Banning him would be banning telling the truth, shocking as it may be, and what kind of example is that setting to children? My argument is the problem is not with Eminem but with the society that gives him his material.      Are people not allowed to entertain fiction within music. If I wrote a song about violence it does not necessarily mean I am violent or that I really advocate it. Is this sort of fiction only allowed to authors of literature. If our children took more notice of literature would we ban them from reading certain books.      I'm 16, I love modern music and freedom of expression, but having listened to Eminem, I must say I was deeply disturbed, not by the language but the content. He seems to be becoming an idol for those younger than me, a fact which I am not comfortable with. Should Eminem be banned? No. But stronger controls on the music that young children are allowed to buy need to be introduced.      Eminem is a talentless offensive idiot but to ban him would just play into his own hands by giving him the publicity he craves. (Anyone remember Frankie Goes to Hollywood?) Much as I loathe his music and bigoted opinions you can't ban something just because you don't agree with it.      Thanks to this bigot, after being a citizen for 26 years in the US, his fans racially taunted my daughter. Thank you Eminem, but there will be backlash somewhere, I for one will stand up against hooligans like you.      I don't think his music should be banned. If parents train their children with strong morals and values, then they don't have to worry what they listen to in music or stuff at school. Kids are very smart, they know what's right from wrong. Long live freedom of speech.      Instead of banning Eminem, who has talent and originality to his works, can we please ban manufactured dross like Steps, S-Club 7 and that (ugh) new band coming out in ""Popstars""?      Whether or not he should be banned is a question I am uneasy with. However I would say that the popularity of this debate has given the opportunity for many of us to question our own beliefs on to what extent individuals should get away with expressing bigotry on groups in society.      It's the media again, stirring things up! Fortunately, not all people believe what the papers want us to believe. I believe in freedom of expression. If he had a difficult childhood it's good he can express it through song. Considering that most pop songs are really meaningless without any depth, this type is more interesting although not exactly run of the mill.      Yes - Eminem should be banned as he promotes and celebrates 'thug culture'. However, banning him will just guarentee his popularity, so we should not grant him the centre of attention that he so obviously wants. I suggest a media blackout.      Its a straight censorship question. We (nearly) all understand the sense in categorising films as 18,15, PG etc. and all understand the thinking behind the TV 9 p.m. watershed. There is no case for banning Eminem, parental control and censorship to protect the young and impressionable is required.      All this has certainly got my mother up in arms, that's all I can say!      The concert at Manchester was excellent, the albums are fantastic, he is just so cute, wears the most wonderful clothes and has got to be the most talented person to come out of the USA ever. Why does anyone want to ban him? The men who do are jealous, the women who do need to lighten up. On a more serious note, freedom of speech is a terribly important thing, and never ever to be taken lightly, whatever you believe.      I went to the show last night in London and it was amazing, you can't ban Eminem, so many people like him, it wouldn't be fair, you'd be depriving a large majority of people, just because some people over-analyse his lyrics!      Please don't ban him. I'll be forced to go out and buy the CD... and I don't like rap. I guess I could put it on the shelf next to the Sex Pistols and Spycatcher.      Since when did the state have the option to decide what music we listen to. On that basis, we should ban a whole series of controversial books, films, videos. Maybe we could have big bonfires to burn all the banned material, and find someone to blame, and persecute them! I think that the 'moral majority' should see this for what it really is - cheap, tacky publicity and sales promotion. And by calling for it to be banned, they are actually giving the record company some of the best publicity of all! Come on, people, let's not play in to their hands!      I have a 13 year old daughter who loves Eminem. Though a lot of his lyrics are his own personal thoughts and lifetime experiences, I took the step to ban her from playing the CD in the garden last summer as we have elderly neighbours and when my nieces (8 and 5) are around. You can't stop them listening to the radio and watching TV. I am surprised that Stan wasn't banned by the BBC completely. I don't think it is a real problem, after all we had the Sex Pistols in the 1970s didn't we?      Eminem is the best. Don't ban him from the UK.     I have always believed that music represents the era we are living in. We do not live in a nice Barbie world, we live among all those things Eminem sings about so why hide from reality? Why refuse that part of the truth Eminem sings about? Sad, hard to cope with, unjust, but still true.      After watching Eminem live in Manchester I was blown away by the sheer presence of the world's biggest music figure. Eminem is truly a lyrical genius.      Hitler used censorship to control Germany in WWII, and the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees freedom of speech. Alongside that is freedom not to listen. I am gay, and have also been beaten up for it, but music doesn't make people homophobic. I say let Eminem rock - I enjoy his music.      Most definitely not, shall we have a poll to ban free speech as well? The music is dull but the lyrics tell a different story of a man who has been ignored by the very people who need to open their eyes      I remember about 30 years ago a similar fuss about Alice Cooper's 'controversial' stage show - he used a guillotine on stage and faked executions. The shock, the horror! But did all of us who went to these concerts come out and murder people? I think not. Have some regard for the intelligence of the audience. My 15 year old daughter is a fan, but has the sense to realise that 'Slim Shady' is simply a persona, an alter-ego. For God's sake, everyone get a grip - do you really want to ban music you don't like??      I am at Sheffield Uni and believe the ban to be undemocratic, pointless and misguided. Yes he talked about 'killing faggots', then in another song said 'there's no reason a man and another man can't elope'. These songs are old fashioned morality plays that provoke discussion. Censorship is a morally bankrupt process that prevents discussion. Long live freedom of speech.      If Eminem had not released his singles. Then we would never have heard of Dido. So just ignore him and listen to Dido. Much better      Never heard of him before seeing this item.      Eminem is only expressing his thoughts and feelings through music. Maybe that's the only way for him to do so in order for the people to listen to his problems.      It is a sad so see yet another high profile bigot emerge and enjoy such seemingly blind widespread support from the many and justification for his apparent bigotry from the few. In April it will be the anniversary of the London nail bomber outrages that resulted in scores of injuries and in the deaths of two gay men and a pregnant straight woman who embraced diversity. I knew one of the two gay men who were murdered. The apparent misogynistic and homophobic ranting of Eminem in his lyrics gives succour to those who are filled with irrational hate and fear and who are the cause of countless gay bashing and male on female violence each and everyday. There is a fine line between freedom of speech and the freedom to spout hatred towards certain groups. It seems sad that we even have to worry about banning such a person in the first place.      Because he's white there are many offensive words such as the racist N---word that Eminem probably would never dare use in his lyrics! But it has been used by many other black hip-hop artists like Public Enemy, NWA and the Fugees. Some of these artists have used very racist anti-white comments in their music, and I remember one rap star commenting ""my music is dedicated to blacks only, and is not intended for whites"". Can you imagine the uproar if Eminem said that about blacks? I am not racist myself and I don't support any kind of offensive comments but if Eminem was black we would not be having this discussion!      Gosh, Guy Ritchie's films aren't terribly wholesome either. Could you please ban him too?      Am I the only gay Eminem fan? There must be more of us out there. His music is brilliant, Kim is an amazing track, it is really disturbing to listen to. The fact that a song enrages such emotions is definitely a good thing. Music (art) has so much more potential than the bubblegum pop that rules the charts today. Let him be, think of it as a performance and if you don't like him, don't listen to him. I will gladly turn off the radio if the all-so-familiar tones of Westlife start to play.      Martin Price made a good point but came to the wrong conclusion. Respect to his 12 year old son for finding the lyrics sick and vulgar and for choosing not to listen to them. But this only goes to show that the buying public are not zombies and can make up their own minds about right and wrong. Likewise I do not agree with the content of the lyrics but I like and listen to the music for its shock value.      In the 60's they tried to ban the Beatles for references to drugs. In the 70's they tried to ban The Sex Pistols for references to the Queen. Then, as now, people have a choice to either listen or to not listen. Eminem's controversial stance may have upset certain fractions of society, but the guy is speaking his mind. We live in a democracy and I believe if he has something to say, let him say it.      Ignore him and he'll go away.      No don't ban him. But his music is dull and his lyrics shallow and infantile. Rap is a subcultural cul-de-sac. I have seen him compared to real poets (Keats, Shelley etc) which makes me alternately cringe and howl with laughter.      Why does Martin Price allow his 12 year-old child to buy CDs with an explicit lyrics warning on the cover?      Moral outrage at Eminem's lyrics is misplaced. In truth they are an outpouring of despair and anger at the lack of love or meaning in Eminem's life. Eminem is a product of today's society - a society we all bear the responsibility for. If we wish to sweep Eminem's words under the carpet it is more out of a desire to hide the moral failure in our own hearts.      Definitely not banned, don't be silly, let the protesters protest as they are legally allowed to and let him write his lyrics as he's legally allowed to      What is the point in banning him when people will just listen to him on the Internet or by buying pirate albums, further damaging the music industry.      Why ban him? If you don't like his views or music you're not forced to listen. I personally don't advocate his views but at least they're invoking a debate.      Yes he should be banned. If this is music, then we have all been conned. Even my 12 year old son (who bought one of his CDs) agrees that the lyrics are sick, vulgar and total rubbish and that he is obviously just out for 'cheap publicity' by trying to shock everybody. Well unfortunately in this day and age it doesn't work. My son now uses his CD as a coffee mug mat which he says is the best place for it !!!      Wake up Britain! Have you never listened to the lyrics of songs by Tom Jones, Elvis Presley etc, all 'respectable' musicians? Try 'Delilah' for a start - it's about stabbing someone. Eminem is just more explicit and the current climate is more disposed towards self-expression. Violence has always been in music and always will be. You can always turn the radio off.      For the record, I think his music is no better or worse than the rest of the 'Gangsta Rap' genre, although I thought 'My Name Is..' was funny. He is no more a threat than Ozzie Osbourne was when the Parents Music Resource Centre in the US went after him. This is all about censorship, and people wanting a squeaky clean world with everyone having the same opinions. The world isn't like that. Get used to it.      I saw Eminem on Friday in London and was blown away by the whole show. He has so much talent and basically made a lot of people very happy that night. There was no violence or trouble at the gig and to be honest, if Britain became a country that was able to take that away from me then I wouldn't want to live here. Thank you Eminem, the memories will last longer than the controversy.      Sure, let's ban him. And while we're at it, well I don't like Cliff Richard, so ban him too. And boy bands, they really get on my nerves, so can we ban them as well? How about anyone who's ever had a lyric I disagree with - can we ban them too?      Well, let us all think for ourselves. I think he's great.      I think the sort of people that are offended by Eminem are all too easily offended. The likes of Tatchell have whopping chips on their shoulders and are continually looking for media attention. Much of Eminem's output is quite responsible, as well as displaying real creative genius. He is entertaining to those that like to hear it, and that ultimately is the business he is in. Anybody who has their prejudices reinforced by his lyrics will find approval for their views wherever they look.      Is anyone seriously suggesting that this horrendous stuff is music? It sounds so awful that I have to turn my radio off as soon as I hear it. I'd rather listen to my washing machine!      Believe me, there is a lot worse than Eminem in the world of rap. Let the man get on with his music and get a life!The rest of us have the right to listen and see what we want and that is thanks to that thing called FREEDOM.      To ban someone so minuscule and meaningless as Eminem is silly but to condone his spiteful contempt, just because we can't ""mirror his bigotry"", is simply irresponsible. We should highlight his primitive shortcomings in civilised public discourse instead, there is enough written of him. We cannot in any way give credibility to misogyny and homophobia.      In spite of what he says, the man has not committed a crime (unlike Mike Tyson, whom you did let in). Any nation that calls itself free cannot block anyone from entry simply because the words they say or sing.      Eminem must be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever people have to say about him, good or bad, it's all publicity which is exactly what he wants. He's not the first artist to be controversial and the more he offends people, the more records he sells. He shouldn't be banned because he's not exactly a threat to society, just a rapper who everyone will get bored with eventually.      I believe that the university was right to ban him from performing, as there are opinions highlighted in his music that conflict with those set out by the institution. This certainly does not amount to censorship. Preventing him from appearing in the public forum is a different matter. That said it is difficult to see how his songs do not have a negative influence given the age groups of the children that I have heard listening to and repeating the lyrics in his music.      I think he is a superb artist and poet. The first rap artist to make me sit up and listen to what is being said. ""Stan"" and ""Kim"" on the latest album are quite exceptional pieces of art. Why shouldn't he rap about his own life? He is not telling you to do it. He is a musician/rapper/whatever you want to call him who paints pictures with his music. We all watch horror films, slasher movies, psychological thrillers, real life dramas....this is the soundtrack.      I think that too many people take Eminem too seriously. Many forget that not everything that is recorded on a CD is the truth. Do we really believe that S Club 7 can ""Reach For The Stars"", or that Britney Spears is actually ""Crazy""?      I think at some point or another you see a rising of a star profile ...which Eminem embraces proudly. Its the uniqueness of his music and lyrics that make people listen to it and relate to their own life ... another great speaker was the late Tupac; provocative lyrics about the society and injustices but true to certain extend. I think the rage in his music is the kind of inner instinct that probably everybody has it but afraid of letting it out.      If I stood in the middle of a city protesting how much I hate Gays/Blacks/Disabled/police, would I really be allowed to continue by a crowd who says ""oh, we live in a country of free expression, lets listen"" or would I be arrested for public order offences or would I just be beaten up? What do you think?      I think that banning Eminem is a terrible idea, his latest album was a best-seller in the UK last year. Also, banning Eminem will only encourage more people (especially teenagers) to listen to him as a way of rebelling. Finally, just because people listen to his music it does not mean they share the same views as him.      I thought we live in a free country with freedom of speech. Ban a musician? Then we are no better than Hitler.      While I personally find Eminem's music nihilist and atonal, I think banning his music is a knee-jerk reaction that belies the root cause of youth violence and rage. It is all too simple for the Government to ban music, art or writing that highlights the views of antisocial individuals. Such conduct allows them to maintain the image of taking action, without having to actually acknowledge and forge solutions to societal problems. The more things change, the more they stay the same.      Surely the mere fact we are discussing this means that Eminem has done a good job. For him all publicity is good publicity, if he believes what he says then good, but chances are he says it too sell records and he seems to have it down to a fine art.      The government's recent comments ring true here. We should ban a man (Eminem) who has committed no crime, yet we didn't ban a man (Tyson) who has. Banning someone because you disagree with his opinions is the first step towards totalitarianism, where perhaps people are barred from religious expression because they are Jewish? Let's stop the rot before it starts.      I don't like Eminem but that does ""not"" mean that he should be banned. If Eminem doesn't like homosexuality, as far as I am concerned there is nothing wrong with him voicing his opinion. We should be free to make our own choices about what we ourselves consider acceptable.      Censorship at this level is a bad thing because it could lead on to other stuff being banned too. This is the 21st Century, grow up! If it offends you, don't listen to it but, don't try to stop everyone else listening, and allowing them to form their own opinions.      He should be praised, not banned. My mother said to me a few days ago that he says ""disgusting things"". It's no more than would see or hear in an 18-certificate movie. His lyrics can be seen as offensive, but I prefer to think of them as challenging. He's just trying to express his opinion, and he has every right to do so. And anyway, if people don't want to listen to him, don't listen to him!      My 13 year old son listens to Eminem in much the same way that I listened to David Bowie. The last thing that will stop teenagers listening to this unsavoury character is people like me or the Government banning him. You may as well have him deified.      Stonewall claim Eminem doesn't rail against black people because ""he's scared of them"". Hasn't it occurred to them that he might be homophobic but not racist or is that notion too dangerous for them to contemplate? Let him play and let people be given the credit for coming to their own conclusions.      Certainly not until we ban Steps and all the rest of the boy/girl band ""fall in love"" lyrics that are doing far more damage to society than Eminem. I personally am sick of the politically correct brigade objecting to freedom of speech when it doesn't suit their cocooned little world....      Whatever happened to freedom of expression. Just because a person listens to something it does not mean they have to agree with it. If individuals mirror this bigoted behaviour then those individuals should be punished. Has Sheffield SU banned all literature holding racist or homophobic views from it's libraries?      To be honest, I would rather see a ban on the soulless and talent-free drivel from teeny boy-bands that pollute the airwaves. Here is a man who raps with an astounding lyrical dexterity and talent that is remarkably refreshing today. As for accusations of homophobia and sexism. I think Eminem is an equal-opportunities hater, his rage is directed at all groups - himself included. He is just very, very angry. Fortunately he creates awesome music from his rage. As for M Fox claiming he ""ruined"" Dido's tune: listen to the song, actually listen to the lyrics and you will see that they, combined with the story of the chorus, have a haunting tragedy that Dido is probably pretty proud of.      Should we ban Eminem? No because he has talent! He may have questionable morals but he does have ability. No one ever talks about banning the likes of the Spice Girls and Westlife and all these other ridiculous excuses for pop groups. So why ban someone whose famous because he is talented rather than because a faceless record company executive said ""make it so!""      And here I was, thinking that censorship was a thing of the past and that we now live in a tolerant and multi-cultural society. Oh well, guess I was wrong. I'm ashamed to admit that I did my degree in Sheffield as I was always proud of how the university claimed to accept all cultures and beliefs. I didn't realise that this was on the proviso that they didn't offend the ears of the chattering classes.      Personally I think that his attitude stinks and that he is probably a xenophobe. His music is awful - look what he did to Dido's song to turn it into Stan.     Make your own decisions, take your own risks, be responsible for the outcome of your own decisions. No-one is forced to do anything they don't want. If you don't like his music then switch it off but you have no right to force others to do the same.      Having actually been beaten up, just for being gay, I say yes ban him.      I do not think you can ban someone on the principle that you should never block freedom of expression. What saddens me is that people are willing to fall for Eminem's undoubtable skill for marketing himself and his image.      On behalf of the entire United States, I apologise to the UK for creating the market for Eminem. Unintelligence has become somewhat of a fad in the US these days and, of course, if you want to be stupid, you have to be smart. This is exactly why Eminem will never make fun of or write lyrics depicting African Americans in a negative light. If he does, his career is over. Listen with an open mind, but always remember what your own personal values have brought you.      While Eminem's lyrics might not be to everyone's taste, I do find this hysteria a bit disturbing. He's a pop artist - nothing more. If Sheffield SU can't see that for what it is then that's their business but I do believe that the rest of us can make up our own minds. If you don't like him, don't buy a ticket to his shows or buy his records.      I'm sure the same thing was said of the Beastie Boys when they first swore in an interview on national TV. The band were criticised as aggressive, their lyrics declared misogynist and their behaviour condemned as abhorrent and something to be discouraged for fear that our young may replicate the image. Eminem's music is simply representative of modern day images transmitted to our screens on a daily basis. Sad, but unfortunately true. To ban the US rapper from the UK would be highly hypocritical given the present state of the medium of television and cinema.      I think that Eminem is a fount of misplaced rage. He is so self-conscious about his own life that he sings about it to comfort himself. I believe that some of his work is very good but other bits are just mass produced over-commercialised songs with no meaning or thought about the effect that they may have on the audience which he operates in. I am sitting on the fence on this one but he would not be where he is if he wasn't talented would he?      Surely we learned something from the ""Frankie Goes to Hollywood"" fiasco some years ago, when attempts by DJ Mike Read to ban the song ""Relax"" caused sales to jump and the song to go to . Ignore Eminem and he will go away. Make a fuss and he's here to stay. (Gosh that rhymes !!!)      No! Eminem should not be banned. I believe that people have the right to express themselves through their music. It is up to the listening public to choose whether any viewpoint is a valid one in each person's belief system. If we begin to censor music then it will become less expressive as a result of musicians being scared of censorship. It is my view that music is a way of communicating your emotions without them being taken literally. It is when music IS taken literally that we see arguments and problems related to its message.      Of course it should be banned, along with all the other songs with naughty words. We should only listen to government approved music. Nanny knows best.      The only thing that should be banned is banning things.      What use will banning Eminem do? People already listen to his music, and have every right to do so. Banning it will make it seem 'glamorous' and therefore attract the more suggestible of the population. Also, we failed to ban convicted rapist Mike Tyson from fighting in the UK even though the law said we should - so why should we ban someone who hasn't even committed a crime? One law for all and freedom of choice and expression - that's what we need.      A little more publicity won't hurt now will it?      The best thing about the ban is that it has certainly got people talking about the issue. I think his lyrics are disgusting and highlighting them will show him up for the nasty little man he is. Remember Shabba Ranks - another homophobic bigoted rapper? No? Pop stars come and go and the quicker Eminem goes the better! I commend Sheffield for raising the issue. I have my own personal ban on my car radio.      No Eminem shouldn't be banned - the content of his songs are not for the faint-hearted I admit, but he's a performer - it's a role. Should we ban all press for Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" due to the extreme nature of the character? Let's give up on the ""nanny state"" and live in the twenty-first century for goodness sake! Many radio stations already bleep out or dip the sound on portions of the songs already as they break (or at least stretch) broadcasting rules and codes of conduct. My advice - if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Personally I find it some of the most interesting music I have come across in a long time.      Yes - but only because his ""music"" is horrible!      M and M's? They're only like Smarties and they haven't been banned!      I think that if we were all brain dead drones then maybe he should be banned. Since we are not and CAN THINK FOR OURSELVES, I believe that we can choose for ourselves too.      No, he shouldn't be banned "
HOC HOC-AJ 7.47 " My mother deserves a small fortune being spent on her this Christmas, but she'd be happiest if I spent a little more time with her and did the washing up! To see her happy is all I want and that needn't cost anything.      How much do I plan to spend? Simple: as much as I can afford. Anyone who spends more than they can afford is an idiot. The problem is, these days there is an expectation to splash out at Christmas just like with everything else. As a nation we are becoming more and more materialistic and more and more in debt as a result.      Both my partner's and my families do not make Christmas a big deal. Both of our parents already said to leave them to themselves for this year. Normally when we see something we think someone will like in the family and can afford it, we'll just buy it. Why should we have to go without for a few months after to get someone a gift 'on time' or wait until the right time of the year to buy or give it to them? You could show your appreciation and love to family and friends any time of the year, and not necessarily by any material means.      Throwing expensive presents at people is the lazy way of showing you care, and doesn't teach children the value of things. The smallest, cheapest present can be the nicest one, if chosen carefully and with time and love. We have unfortunately let Christmas become an orgy of eating and spending which many people neither enjoy nor can afford, fuelled by the media into hysterical consumerist frenzy. We used to give gifts to each other, small tokens of affection. Does anyone remember what Christmas is really about?      This is the first year that I don't have much money to spend on gifts and so I'm making all my presents: picture frames, beach bags and handmade cards. It's amazing what you can make and how appreciative people are when you give them a handmade present. I think that people should put more thought into presents and think less about commercialism at Christmas. I think it's a blessing this year that I am not buying into the 'spendmass' season.      I bought nearly all my presents in November, for family only, and that's it. Even if I wasn't due to buy a property in the New Year, I'd be tightening my belt as I want to enjoy myself all year round, not just for a fortnight in December. The rest from work and seeing family will be great. The time of year doesn't justify starvation for two months as you pay off the plastic- but fair enough, I don't have children to keep quiet.      To all of you misers out there - life's not a rehearsal and you might as well enjoy yourself. Imagine how life would be without Christmas - it brings plenty of reasons to go to the pub and eat and drink too much. At least it's a holiday and a bit of fun - come on misers - cheer up.      Presents are completely unimportant. I'd rather spend the money on the experience. Good food, good wine and lots of treats. To me a good Christmas is measured by how enjoyable the whole day was, not by what I got as gifts.      I was under the impression that Christmas was about the birth of Christ and the celebration of that event in the Christian religion, not how much money are you going to spend. Many people seem to fall into the trap of over spending, over eating and over drinking over this holiday period, in the strange believe that this is what Christmas is all about. I am not what anyone could call a Christian but I respect others beliefs and find the commercialism of this aspect of religion repugnant.      I'm having a wonderful time running (with others of course) parties for disabled and old people. I've had one so far and it was really friendly and a fantastic atmosphere. There's all the old money to collect for charity before the euro comes in as well. I'm not short of friends or food, and it doesn't cost me a penny. I suggest that if you really enter into the spirit of Christmas like Scrooge did, you'll get so much out of it.      I'm spending absolutely NOTHING on Christmas this year, next year, ever again. 21st December is the real holiday, messed up by the church. I don't participate in the consumerist garbage, and on the 21st I go across the street to support a wonderful Sikh eatery, as opposed to buying some item that promotes more slave labour in whatever country.      What a bunch of scrooges on this page! I'll be enjoying Christmas, it's a good excuse for a few days off work on the beer!      Every year my partner and I buy high street vouchers over the 12-month period to spend on Christmas presents. For Christmas 2000 we had bought #800 of vouchers but we only spent #600 so we had #200 to spend in the sales. For this Christmas we bought #1,000 worth of vouchers, have bought presents for exactly the same people and yet we have no vouchers to spend in the sales!. Go figure.      For someone who doesn't celebrate Xmas it's amazing how much gets spent on chocolates for work colleagues, neighbours, friends abroad and so on. This year I've already spent over #80 and that's just on boxes of Roses, nothing fancy.      As usual I'm spending as little as possible on Commercemas. If I spend more it will be due to inflation.      I'm certainly making this an expensive Christmas but since I'm in my first real job and for the first time earning a decent amount of money, I reckon that that's reasonable. Christmas is a time to think about the people you care about and to show them that you care. Thoughtful presents, cards with heart-felt notes, they can be part of this. The cost isn't important - I'm doing the spending because it's an excuse for a spending spree. But because I've been ill over the last few years and neglected people who've continued to give me care and attention and so on, I'm spending a lot on writing and sending cards to those people to try to let them know that I appreciate them.      Christmas is a celebration of greed. It should be called Greedmas. It's about taking, not giving, and the only Christmas spirit you see, especially in London, is what everyone stuffs down their gullets in the pub. It'll be a Tibetan Christmas for me this year.      Christmas is our family's time of debate and reconciliation, usually in that order. Generally, we admit whether the year has been economically good or bad. If good for all, there is no price limit on presents, if particularly bad for anyone, we set a price limit. But the main thing is that we all get together as a family, with or without gifts.      The best gift you can give someone at Christmas is company. There are too many people spending the festive time alone, gifts or money do not really matter to these people, all they really want is their family there for them.      I will be happier receiving no gifts and having my partner and family around me, than being alone. The best gift, in my opinion, is love.      To Will Faulkner: I'm afraid I don't share your enthusiasm for company over the festive season. I spend my entire life around people and would just love to spend a few days on my own away from family and friends avoiding small talk and arguments about who gets the last sausage roll. However, I will be getting presents for family costing well in excess of #1000 . After all it's not the receiving of presents that matters, it's how much they're worth.      My family loves to both give and receive gifts but all the presents we give are given anonymously so the recipient can only guess at the identity of the giver. We believe this is the best way because when we give a gift we do not want to also give a debt. Nor do we want to try to impress our loved ones with our generosity. We also insist that any gifts to us are also given anonymously. We have many friends who are not so well off and we would hate them to feel obliged to return gifts to us that they can't afford. This method has worked well for us for many years and none of us feel any pressure at this wonderful time of year!      My wife and I budget about #5,000 for Christmas. This year we're staying at home and having most of our family to stay and many friends too so there won't be much left for presents but a week long party with family friends will be fantastic! I can't wait!      Christmas is a load of ****. I feel sorry for those with children who are caught up in the consumer feeding frenzy, egged on by greedy commercial vultures. All people should boycott Christmas, tell the marketeers that they are sick of being exploited and manipulated and demonstrate that they are capable of having a good time without being pressurised into buying unnecessary trinkets for people who live in a society where they mostly have everything they need anyway!      Thank God for unprecedented prosperity over the last few years. There is more real money in circulation now than ever before. It is good to see people spend over Christmas and enjoy the fruits of their labour as well as look forward to the new year with optimism.      I am not religious but then neither is Christmas. It has become a national, multi-cultural festival whose main objectives are firstly to make everyone feel good (through giving to others and decorating everything), and secondly to boost the economy by spending piles of cash. Neither objective is more important. Personally, I'll be spending around #200 I expect, although I haven't started yet (panic!).      What is Christmas about? I don't really care. What I do care about is that this special day reminds people to give special blessings to their families and friends.     Around about August this year, my boyfriend and I were coming to the end of a years global back-packing. Despite being incredibly poor, we looked ahead and decided to do our Christmas shopping in Bali because we could buy loads of gorgeous things for a FRACTION of the cost - thus saving money. We had to clear our backpacks out to make room for all the pressies and then lug them around for weeks in searing heat as we travelled home. We got back to find that our families had saved last years Christmas pressies and as we were showered in gifts we felt like we had to give something back and ended giving away our Bali Christmas pressies as extra 'getting back' gifts. Then we had to go out shopping AGAIN for Christmas to replace our other presents. So despite our efforts we didn't save a thing. Maybe the government should publish some gift-giving/receiving code of practice to avoid this kind of debacle for others!      I'm overjoyed to welcome in Christmas this year. After the horrors and hardships of 2001 I'm simply looking forward to sharing love and laughter with my significant other, my pets and the family (not necessarily in that order). Wishing everyone a peaceful, restful and joyous time. Oh and some snow would be nice. Cos it's free!      I love Christmas and this year is going to be even more special being with my family as I haven't been home for months. Even if you are not religious it's a time when everyone is happy and there is so much to do. It's too expensive though, I have spent #100 on presents and who knows on going out, which is hard on your overdraft when I am a student.      I'll be darting around the shops, probably spending about #400 on presents and food. On Christmas Eve, I'll go to the pub at lunchtime, drink several pints with my friends, and then stuff myself with turkey at my mum's. Then I'll go to my friends' house and drink some more. On Christmas day I'll eat chocolate, followed by a huge lunch, more chocolate, plenty of wine, more chocolate, then go to bed and wish every day could be this good!      I will probably spend about #50. Personally, I try to avoid the annual brainwashing debacle in which everyone is told to spend vast quantities of money to confirm that they care for people. The more effort you put into Christmas, the less of a life you have during the remainder of the year. In short, people go over-the-top on Christmas because they have nothing else better to do. Deal with it.      I enjoy Christmas lights, I enjoy brass bands playing carols in the town, I enjoy putting up the tree and trying to think of what to give my family, in short, I enjoy Christmas. So for me it is time to lighten up, put that roast in the oven and celebrate. It's not every day people feel obligated to be nice to each other.      I cancel Christmas every year. Trouble is no one else listens. Baaa humbug.      Though am a Muslim, I will be spending some money on Christmas for my Christian friends and co-workers. Wishing everybody a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. May the world be a better place for people of all faiths and none. Amen      I may be reverting back to what worked when I was a kid, but this year I made 80% of Christmas gifts for friends and family. I've been making necklaces and painting teapots, hoping that the real gift is the thought and time that goes into them. What's more, I managed to sell a bunch of the necklaces to workmates for their loved ones, allowing me to buy the other 20% of my gifts. You know, I may have made money this year!      I've just committed to paying for a 3 year higher education for the youngest daughter in an poor Indonesian family I support regularly. This will cost me ca #1000, so I don't think my husband will be getting any Christmas present this year - or next! We don't need presents at Christmas, we buy when on holiday instead.      Humbug! Spend, spend, spend on rubbish for spoilt kids. Teach them instead to be giving 365 days of the year, they'll then appreciate receiving whenever it happens to them. We perpetuate this dismal orgy of material greed. Think!      People who do not spend should be charged under anti-terrorist laws. How unpatriotic not to spend!      I have told my family that I have spent all the money on a month in Portugal JUST for me. See you in January.      When else do we stop to take time to purchase gifts for the people we love and appreciate? When else do we reflect on the blessings that life still offers and are inspired to help those in need? Instead of looking at Christmas as just another chore and expense on our already over-burdened and over-extended lives, I suggest that we view Christmas as a special time for appreciating the good things in our lives - family, friends and each other. If that inspires you to go out and buy gifts, go out and buy them from your heart (but only with the healthy endorsement of your wallet).      It's cost me a small fortune as after much nagging by the other half I've bought her a brand new VW Golf on the understanding that it's her Xmas present for the next five years!      Yes, I'll be spending a lot this Christmas - spending a lot of time with my family. People should remember that it's your presence, not your presents that count more.      If only we could all look beyond ourselves (me included) Christmas would be a happier occasion. If this is my most expensive Christmas, I hope it is expensive in terms of the amount of TIME I spend on family and friends. I don't need to line retailers' pockets to show my family I care. They'll be happy if I spend a few days in their company.      I was going to say I'd be spending nothing on Xmas, but it's not strictly true. I'll be taking three weeks off work. I'll be going to parties, eating, drinking - I've even bought a Xmas card for my mum. All the same, the total will be less than 200 quid.      My Christmas begins on 1st December and finishes on 6th January. In between I cram in as much as possible. I don't worry too much about the commercialisation because I keep present buying to token gifts but I'm up for pretty much everything else. My happiest moment is watching a local inner city church fill up with presents for the underprivileged children in the area until the altar is submerged beneath a couple of tons of teds and every seat is full of toys. It doesn't get much more Christmassy than that!      Yes, both Christmas and Eid have become big consumer exercises. A lot of awareness and spirit has been lost.      I got clobbered by Bin Laden, financially speaking and the three children will get about half of what they have received in the past. We feel that cutting back is a good lesson for them. However it is unfortunate for the many workers and emerging economies throughout the world who will suffer greatly as a result of the recession in the USA, Japan and Europe. Glad to hear the Brits are ""splashing out""!      The true festival is actually 21st December. (The Winter Solstice). As a Wiccan this is my main concern but it will not stop me enjoying Christmas in the company of my partner and a couple of other close friends. I have not been in a position to spend a lot of money this year due to my having been unemployed for most of it. However I have now started my own business and although cash is extremely tight, I am not. I will do my best to make certain my partner and my friends have their best-ever Christmas.      What is wrong with receiving lots of presents at Christmas time? I love this time of year with presents under the tree. I just hate the shopping bit and messy gift wrapping, so I did all of that online!      I am a total non-believer in any religion whatsoever but I still find it so wrong that a ""so-called"" religious event is celebrated in such a commercial manner. If the high street retailers had their way I am sure that we would have at least two Christmas' a year. I suggest that next year, no retailer be allowed to advertise any Christmas related items unitl 24 December!      Aarrgghh !! It's good to celebrate Christmas, but it's really about giving thanks for the light of Christ entering the world, and not how much we can spend at Harrods. And Jenny, Paganism isn't ""nicer"" than Christianity. After all, what block of wood or other repulsive pagan idol ever died for you as Jesus did?      Christmas (or Mythmas as we call it in our house) has nothing to do with religion as far as we are concerned. It is a great opportunity to get together with family and friends and enjoy spending time together... giving and receiving gifts, eating and drinking all the things you don't usually have during the rest of the year. Those of you who are harping on about the ""real"" meaning of Christmas would do well to remember that Jesus wasn't born on 25 December, it has not always been a Christian holiday, and aside from the nativity scenes, all of the Christmas trimmings are from a much earlier (and kinder) religion - paganism.      I would not have a problem with Christmas if it was not mentioned before 1 December. It's just too much when you see shops putting up their decorations at the end of September or thereabouts. Christmas should be special - and indeed it was. I remember from when I was younger. But nowadays it's all too commercial and lasts too long, and those darn songs played all over the place make me cringe. Zzzzzz, boring... Limit it to December, and keep it to a family-based affair.      Giving money away is something I enjoy all year round, not just at Christmas. I would like to think that nobody would judge me for not putting a penny into that charity box on the street corner during Christmas week!      I can't be certain how much I've spent on presents this Christmas, but I know it isn't an exorbitant amount. More important than the amount of money each present costs is the feeling behind it towards the person to whom you are giving the gift. To put a smile on a family member's face on Christmas morning is more important than how much you spend on their present.      Christmas has become the anti-holiday. Spend, spend, spend, rush, rush, rush, pressure, pressure, pressure - all the while missing time with family and friends. I like the American holiday Thanksgiving much more.      I love giving gifts. So far I've spent about $450.00 and I'll probably spend some more. Unlike other years I had some time to shop this year. Certaintly I do not think Christmas is for spending money... it celebrates the birth of Christ. It's just a time of year to buy some gifts and see the faces of people that open them. By the way I have 13 nephews.      I have worked for years to get family and friends to understand that I want nothing whatsoever to do with this Christmas rubbish. I nearly succeeded last year, but my dear brother bought me two bags of nuts and I received three Christmas cards. Damn! With luck, I shall probably hear Slade's Merry Christmas and Wizzard's I Wish it could be.... about twice, because I love the songs, but I'm sick of hearing them in every shop, pub and radio programme.      Keep Christmas to two days, as it used to be, and I might just grudgingly join in. Otherwise, you can all do with it just what you do to the poor old turkey. If you want to contact me on Christmas Day, I shall be enjoying a day at work to avoid all the nonsense, while the rest of the country is getting fat, drunk and bored. Long live the non-Christmas. You think I'm joking? Not a chance.      Much as I hate to get caught up in the commercialism of it all I tend to overspend on my children because my own childhood is remembered as a time when I was denied so much - especially love. I do know, though, that we wouldn't have Christmas without Jesus and I am teaching my children about giving as well as receiving and they have given anonymously to a charity for underprivileged children.      What, you mean money isn't our God?      Twice as much as it should because while buying gifts I keep seeing good stuff and buy it for myself.      Christmas, or whichever holiday you celebrate, isn't about trying to compartmentalise what you've done, how much you've spent, or justifying why you're doing things. It's a time to spread a little joy around, in any way that suits you. Whether that be a quiet time at home, or a family gathering, or a pub crawl, find something that you enjoy, with people (or not) that you enjoy, and celebrate being alive.      People forget what Christmas is about. We need to remember that christmas is for celebrating the birth of Santa Claus. We should spend lots of cash and buy games consoles.      Gareth E - if retail jobs are so easy to get at this time of year why are you unemployed? From experience I know some people treat shop workers appallingly but there's plenty of kinder folk who make you feel appreciated. Yes, I've just started working at a department store, thank goodness some employers don't consider me over the hill even though I'm in my 60s! Merry Christmas!      As one of the mass of unemployed, I have to say that I'll be spending nothing on Christmas. I simply can't afford to. When all you get is barely enough to live week to week, Christmas kind of becomes irrelevant apart from it making finding jobs in the retail sector both intolerable and very easy to find.      So far it's cost me same as every year - #0! Many of the earlier replies saying what Christmas costs them are nothing but hypocites. Most of us don't go to church or even believe in Christ so why are they getting into debts to celebrate what they don't believe? Why won't people be more charitable and give these monies to charities rather than waste money on presents, wrappers and cards?      As a British Hindu, my family celebrate Christmas. Mainly because it gives us a good chance for the family to get together and what better excuse to buy a loved one presents. Pradip      Most of us forget what Christmas is really about. We celebrate this day because Jesus Christ was born in this world. It is sad to see that everything turns into commercialism where money is everything.      I find that during the Christmas holidays people of many countries overspend and run their credit cards right threw the roof. Then they spend the next three months paying off their debt with interest. That means you are spending more for the individual gifts that you are buying. This year I intend to buy one important gift and that is for my son. I am opening a savings account for his education which I think would be the most important gift of all.      My husband and I will be celebrating Christmas abroad again this year. The UK is such a dismal place to celebrate the best gift God gave us. It's nice to see family for Christmas day but sitting around for a week watching re-runs, getting fat isn't our idea of fun. We prefer to go to countries where they really know how to party - this year it's Mexico. As for presents, we pass them round before we go and try to keep to a reasonable budget. We certainly don't agree with the commercialisation of Christmas, but then true Christians don't.      This is by far my most expensive Christmas ever! As it's the first since I left university, I can afford to go a little overboard, and finally make up for all those IOU's. I'm spending approx. #500 on family and friends, and don't begrudge a penny of it. I just hope they don't expect it every year! As trite as it sounds though, I have to say the thing I am looking forward to the most is going home and spending a week with my family, giving is most fun when you are around those you love.      As Steve, York commented, I too will be spending what I can afford. Christmas for me is both a religious festival and also just a time to have fun. Also I do not expect my friends to spend money on me that they can't afford.      So far Christmas has cost me my sanity.      Reading the comments on this page makes me feel sad that all people seem to think Christmas is about is what presents cost, and whether they have a hangover. As a Christian I find it differcult this time of year, because this is a religious festival that has been lowered to pure commercialism.      My girlfriend seems to expect me to spend more on her than my entire family and friends put together. I don't like it, but that's Christmas. So I'm asking Santa for a new low maintenance girlfriend this year.      The more time, love, care and attention my girlfriend spends on selecting a present for me the worse it is. I'd settle for just staying indoors with her and ignoring the family.      Christmas is about fun and enjoyment. I love giving and receiving presents, spending the day with family and friends, stuffing my face with ridiculous amounts of turkey and Christmas pudding, the Movie Blockbuster in the afternoon and the pub in the evening. Christmas is here - enjoy it. I've spent heaps on the missus and I'm happy to do so!      I am hosting a family do for my husband's side of the family. We are for the first time not going to exchange any presents but make sure that we all spend time together which we feel is far more important. It's not that we cannot afford presents but are all in the fortunate position of being able to buy anything that we want. It is all too easy with our busy lives to overlook something that is far more important - family.      I don't know how much I'll be spending on presents but the beer tokens will have to be gathered soon I feel. I've got a great idea, let's all get sloshed! Hurrah!      Being blessed with 11 nieces and nephews, Christmas and birthdays can be a nightmare. I have solved the problem by giving each child two IOUs which they can exchange individually or jointly for a more expensive item at any point in the year for what they really want. This encourages them to combine IOUs and get a large gift for the whole family. So far it has worked and I have a peaceful holiday season and buy a present for only one individual - my partner!      To Mike, UK: Are you looking for a way to excuse your behaviour of spending hundreds of pounds for the Commerce-fest?      From reading some of these comments it is amazing how tight people are and what bizarre stories and excuses they come up with to justify that.      Solve the Christmas problem by only buying presents for people who buy you one first. After the age of twenty you invariable get money for Christmas, so if you spend a proportion of this on gifts in the boxing day sales, you're not only up a few quid, but considered a valued and loved family member.       My relatives and I have reached an agreement - what we really want for Christmas is money. This solves problems of taking things back, getting the ubiquitous socks or aftershave from grandparents, or not knowing what to buy someone. As swapping cheques for similar amounts is rather silly, we leave the money safely in our bank accounts gathering interest, and only swap a few token gifts. "
HOC HOC-AO 7.31 " What I find most disappointing about the comments here is that the majority of negative response comes from people in the UK. I find it sad that as a nation we have not moved beyond the debate about art being an oil painting or a marble sculpture. This country is too overly concerned about the effort of the hands rather than the effort of the mind. Which is probably why Mr Creed doesn't live here.      If there is a power cut, does it cease being art?      Art is essentially a subjective matter. It's amazing how many people equate their opinion with fact. I happen to think that the works of Turner, Constable and their ilk are not ""good art"" but I cannot claim that view to be fact! I also happen to think that the winner of this year's prize is not ""good art"" though I have enjoyed the work of other recent winners. Whatever we think, the Turner Prize has once again achieved its aim, which is to encourage debate and raise the profile of modern art.      Next year I shall be putting forward my entry entitled - 'Extracting the Urine'.      I wasn't going to bother venturing an opinion on this until I saw a suggestion that we should take this ""art"" seriously. The Turner Prize has as much relevance to art as the contents of my dustbin. It is simply a device for selling the artefacts of the untalented poor to the gullible rich. Nobody with the slightest taste would touch this junk with a bargepole.      We have had a small spider living in our bathroom for the past month, ""weaving"" his way around the ceiling. Perhaps I should submit an exhibit for next year's Turner Prize entitled ""Spider Living in Bathroom""?      The Turner prize isn't intended to appeal to the mass population. We are not the target audience. People always ridicule what they don't understand. By laughing at it you're attempting to diminish its merit, therefore making you think that understanding it isn't necessary. It seems to me that the Turner Prize is very successful. It always gets people thinking about the subjects.      I can understand the modern art idea that art is defined by intention rather than skill. However Creed has gone further with his statement that he has no idea what his work means. So now the viewing public must also project what meaning they can think of onto the object. Art without skill is one thing, but art without ideas is pushing it.      I don't think it's fair to have a go at Martin Creed for trying it on. Instead, we should all enter a piece of art next time, and see what happens.      This can be summed up in just five words: What a load of rubbish!      While I like Creed's dodgy wiring, I get a sense of what it must be like to be in the room when the motion sensors in my office incorrectly decide I have gone out and switch off the lights to save energy. The Turner prize continues to ignore the winning speech given a couple of years ago by Brian Eno in which he attacked the art establishment for its inability to rival the explanatory power and teaching ability of so much contemporary science writing. Much of the science which is written about cannot be understood except by experts. Scientists, unlike artists it seems, are the only ones who bother to explain why they do what they do.      Throwing good money after awful art!!      Why assume that an artwork has to be a carefully hand-crafted object or painting? Art moved beyond that tired old notion over a hundred years ago. Neither is art necessarily the product of unique genius. Art is what happens when you, the spectator, perceive the work. Your reactions here are the art.      To Mark, UK. Why don't we get the prize money then?      I think this has become a total joke and I can't believe it commands respect from anybody. Instead of this annual farce, surely it would be better to donate #20k to an Arts College, thus investing in people who have artistic talent.      Bit difficult to hang an empty room with lights going on and off, above the mantle piece.      I wish I had known about the Turner prize during my student days. My university bedroom must have been worth a small fortune! When the national average salary is about #20k, and the Turner prize awards this sum for something that takes a few minutes to ""install"" (or less, if you've got some dodgy wiring), it certainly beats working for a living.      If an installation that turns a light on and off causes us to reflect - even for a few moments - upon the technology behind it, and the vast social achievements that electric light has enabled, then it would seem to have served its purpose. And if a Van Gogh is worth $84 million, then Mr Creed's piece is probably worth #20,000 on the same scale.      Reminds me of a fable I once heard as a kid: ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". To recap: he wasn't wearing anything, but his subjects and the emperor himself were too afraid to say this for fear of being branded stupid, so they kept on saying how beautiful the clothes were. Modern 'Artists' use the same methods. If we don't understand their 'art', we must be stupid. The tailors in the fable did this for money, hence the similarity.      As Edison invented the light-bulb and was therefore the first to switch it on and off - does this make him the first artist of this genre?      Why are so many people so upset about who the Turner prize goes to, when most of them probably don't even go to art galleries?      Perhaps we could submit this web page next year and split the #20k between all of us.     Martin Creed is an oversensationalist artist. His works do not move the viewer emotionally nor contribute anything to the art word. I feel Richard Billingham or Isaac Julian should have won due to their stylisation of society through film or photography. I particularly liked Julian's experimentation with the working of film through camera angles, colour and overall mood and atmosphere.     It could be titled: ""Expressing An Opinion"" and we could describe it thus: A marvellous work of art, reflective of today's modern internet world, where people of all races, creeds and colour come together to share opinions and ideas.      From what I picked up in passing he didn't even wire the lights up himself - surely if that's true he shouldn't even be allowed to enter. Maybe I could put some sunflowers on a chair and ask someone else to paint them for me. Who would take the glory for that?      A light flashing on and off? Half a dead sheep? An unmade bed covered in rubbish? I should have won at least 3 turner prizes last year alone. My bacon sandwich was truly an inspiring sight this morning, please send the prize money to...      Even I, as a former art student, was sceptical about Martin Creed's installation, but the Times art critic explained it in a way that must, I feel, be considered. He said you really have to be there and experience it to appreciate it and that the experience was oddly disquieting. For any installation to have an effect on someone like that totally legitimises it in my eyes and I won't pass personal judgement until I'm able to experience it for myself.      The Turner prize just shows that we can still laugh at ourselves and we are quite happy to continue throwing good money after bad. Good luck to the bloke, I wish I could get #20K for being rubbish at something! I hope he gives the money to charity (I bet he won't).      Creed is not representative of modern art, and not all modern art is brutal, ironic nihilism. The problem is that the general public sees it through the Turner Prize prism. This time they even hauled in Madonna so that more people would be taken in. If you don't understand modern art, then use the following rule of thumb: if it's endorsed by the likes of Madonna, it ain't art.      Flashing lights in an empty gallery? A gallery devoid of art... maybe that's what he was getting at.      Let's face it, it's a big joke right? It's rubbish like this that gives art a bad name. Why don't we celebrate real artists with real talent? The Turner Prize is the home of the talentless. It's nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt.      Congratulations to Mr. Creed for getting away with doing nothing and cashing in on it.      The trouble is, by even responding on this subject I feel that I'm contributing to a debate on art...which a light bulb going on and off clearly isn't!      I like it. You can stand under it and see the light bulb appear above your head when you finally realise what it's all about.      I am amused by the way we fall for the same old trick year after year! The Turner prize is nothing but an exercise in generating publicity through stirring up 'controversy'. The formula is painfully obvious - select the silliest work, get some glamorously vacuous celebrity to hand over the money ('spontaneous' swearing predictably adds to the 'controversy') and wait for tomorrow's tabloid rants against modern art. As for the short-listed works - it has all been seen and done so many times before that it isn't even refreshing, let alone controversial or challenging.      Perhaps for the philistines like me, who consider this to be absolutely ridiculous, the adjudicating committee could explain what precisely makes this absurdity art, let alone prize-winning art?      I've got an idea for a submission to next year's competition. It's called 'Void', the subtext of which is 'Empty space for empty heads'. If you haven't guessed by now the nature of this stupendous piece of artwork, just imagine a completely empty room with nothing in it at all. The space becomes the exhibit itself. Obviously. However, unlike the Emperor's New Clothes, this concept really does have a deep meaning. No, really it does. Why, don't you believe me? I suppose seeing is believing, then.      It is hilarious how people still take the Turner Prize seriously. The joke is painfully obvious and stale. So stale, that they had to get Madonna to swear to liven it up a bit. Why, even Collings' expression was a dead giveaway - half the time he looked as if he was going to burst out laughing any minute.      I'm inspired - next year I'm going to enter 'Garage Door', 'Broken Biro' and 'Who's Just Broken Wind?' Then I'll use the #20,000 to buy some proper art.      Art will eat itself.      Turner would turn in his grave if he saw his name being attached to what is now perceived as art.      By people talking about this they actually give it credence. The shock value and the amount of debate it generates is what fuels contemporary art of questionable merit. If we all shut up about it the contemporary arts scene would hopefully go away and produce something of merit. Though in a media-ruled society, where over-reaction is now the norm, I hardly think it likely that people will stop stoking the fires of publicity.      With apologies to the memory of Kipling if this is not verbatim but it comes from memory and was written by him about 100 years ago:      When the flush of the newborn sun fell first on Eden's green and gold, our father Adam sat under a tree and scratched with a stick in the mould. And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart. Until the devil whispered behind the leaves 'It's pretty, but is it art?'      I stopped purchasing art ages ago but not because my walls and empty spaces are now all covered. Once, artists died and their work became priceless. Now, art is dead and artists are pointless.      Next year I am going to submit an entry for the Turner. It will consist of nothing and be entirely intangible but titled 'The Nation Striking a Pose Depicting the Attitude of Indifference'.      It may be art to some people but to me it's definitely rubbish! I just hope there's a sea-change in art school fashion sooner rather than later, with a return to more traditional media, and that this sort of 'installation' stuff gets consigned to the rubbish bin of history where it belongs.      If you reach the stage where anything can be art what has art become? If the exhibit had a title which provoked some deeper thought it would not be so bad. It really is the case of the emperors new clothes.      The Empty Room is a great metaphor for a post -Christian age culture and art - totally vacuous, devoid of meaning, hope and understanding.      I studied at Art College during the mid eighties, an experience which left me completely disillusioned with the art establishment. The tutors weren't interested in talent but in the personalities of their students. Those who were pushed forward and encouraged were those who had the loudest and most extrovert personalities, those who were the more confident self-publicists in other words. It didn't matter how amateurish and childish their painting and drawing techniques were; that, after all, wasn't considered to be the point of art. These days I find art galleries depressing places. The Art establishment is completely caught up in its own elitist and misguided sense of superiority over the general public. The best artists practising today are probably the technicians who create the spectacular effects on computer games and the animators of Manga films.      One would think that the term 'art' implied some form of craft, skill or expertise in the chosen form? Personally, I intend to take this morning's rubbish, put it in a box, label it 'Urban Detrius' and send it to the Tate. Who knows? I might be #20,000 richer by this time next year!      Call it stupid, call it pointless, or even call it clever. But just please don't call it art. We do not need to change the definition of art, it's served perfectly well for thousands of years. But we do need to think of a new name for this sort of nonsense, so that a new generation of people isn't put off real art forever.      Every time some Gallery pays good money for such tosh as piles of bricks, pickled dead sheep, unmade beds, empty rooms etc they should have the amount paid deducted from their next year's funding - or they should have no funding except entrance fees - then see how long they would keep these buying these exhibits if they had to attract real paying customers !      It's nice to know that in these troubled times, there are still those with a sense of humour! I take it that none of this is serious, is it?      Flashing lights: Fantastic! And in an empty gallery: Oh joy! Minimalist Martin doesn't need to explain the sense of his astonishing work to me! The great thing is that modern art has apparently advanced so far that anyone can be an artist! Even better, the Government can now cut all subsidies to artists and hand out discount vouchers for DIY stores. The money saved could be invested in the NHS, or the transport system, or foreign aid or....      I am pushed to think that ANY of the Turner prize winners are worth the cash! I'm all for contemporary art but I think all of these winners are really taking the biscuit! And don't give me any of that hogwash about self-expression and art for art's sake.      Everyone is missing the point. It's an excellent move on the gallery's part - now they have a large, nicely decorated, clean, well lit (some of the time) room that they will be able to put some nice pictures in when all the fuss dies down. And for just #20,000. A bargain I reckon...      Absolute utter rubbish, how can this be art? I am disgusted. There are people with no homes starving, who have done more to deserve #20,000.      I suppose I must be very old-fashioned, boring and conventional to think that a work of art should be something the artist has created, like a painting, sculpture or photographic work. The likes of Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Rodin etc will be remembered for many years to come. Can the same be said of works of art which consist of animals in formaldehyde, a rumpled bed, an empty beach hut and an empty room with faulty lighting?      I presume that the Turner Prize's job is to do as much as possible to alienate the general public from art? A job it does exceedingly well.      Art is not just painting, sculpting etc but also ideas.      A ridiculous empty space, what a farce. I work hard throughout the work day, and these 'artists' (?) with Willow the Wisp minds can't even describe what they've 'created'! No talent at all, apart from deception in trying, very badly, to impersonate an artist! Nearly all of the population will think of this 'art' as insulting!!      You get the same 'art' at any NCP car park.      I know that art depends much on individual taste etc. But I have to say I'm worried that there are people out there who consider a faulty bit of wiring to be anything other than a problem which requires fixing. When Martin Creed says that it is not up to him to explain what it means, it is because he doesn't have a clue himself. He's just laughing at the con trick he's just pulled.      The Turner Prize organisers have said it is not designed to show the best artists, but art that is most interesting at the time. I am therefore tempted to assume that the other exhibits were in total darkness.      Surely the whole point of great art is that it can only be created by people who possess a rare and unique talent. I could spend 10 years trying to paint a replica of the Last Supper and not achieve it, just as I will never be able to play football like David Beckham or play guitar like Hendrix. However, I have a whole load of things on my bedroom floor which could probably win a Turner prize. Someone receiving #20,000 for a lightbulb going on and off is a payout so obscene it makes the most unfair excesses of footballers and actors pay look reasonable. Have these people not got anything better to do?      If you don't like a piece of work, don't buy it! Simple. If you haven't got anything nice to say, then don't say it. Not everybody shares the same thoughts and opinions.      Is it art ? Of course it is. Is it good art ? No, it certainly is not. In modern art the statement is considered to be everything and skill is no longer part of the equation. Good modern art has a balance of both, yet we rarely see this when it's time for the prizes to be given out. Is this because there's no such thing as bad publicity? Blu-tac and unmade beds might not be good art but year after year they makes good headlines.      Art is anything that someone says is art. It doesn't matter that so few people see the value in some art but at the same time, why is the prize not going to a piece of art which communicates the most to the most people? Real genius is a communicative entity - if people don't get it - what's the point?      Sorry but this kind of thing just makes art into a joke. I remember the time when some esteemed critics were falling over themselves reading meaning and wonder from a mess of paint on a sheet of paper. You should have seen the looks on their faces when they were told it was painted by an elephant, completely at random. Sorry, but there is no skill or talent involved in this kind of modern art, and for people to be awarded amounts which are more than most people's yearly salary for what is essentially just a joke. The classic arts are true masterpieces, involving plenty of vision, skill and talent. A can of baked beans, or a light switch going on/off; any child can come up with.      At least with Damien Hirst's animals in formaldehyde you could appreciate the effort that went into it, even if you didn't appreciate the result. But, to win twenty grand because your wiring's dodgy and then not even bother to make up an explanation! I always thought with a lot of contemporary art the real genius was making up the spiel to explain your ""piece"", now it seems you don't even need to do that, I'm clearly in the wrong job!!      When is someone going to fix that light? After all, they could win next year's prize!      I went to the Tate Modern last year and had to laugh at all the pretentious people taking it seriously. How can this bit of garbage be worth #20,000? I have some lights in my garage that I could do the same with. And my version would be cheaper. Any offers?      As always people have misunderstood the purpose of the Turner Prize circus. The Prize isn't supposed to be about art - it exists for the sole purpose of generating a huge amount of cheap publicity for the Tate, and for its commercial sponsors - and to give the media a chance to fill space by reprinting the same tired clich?s that they used last year. The fact that this year's award was dished out by a pop star should have been enough to set the alarm bells ringing for most people. It's a gimmick - but then again so is most of what passes for British culture these days.      I installed a new three-way spotlight in my kitchen yesterday. Does that make me an artist? I could argue that as an installation it illustrates the futility of man's struggle against the consumerist society (I was replacing another light which fell apart) and on another level illustrating the success of technology over our primeval fear of the dark. On TV last night, I note that Mr Creed couldn't actually explain what his work was about. That's because it isn't about anything. It's a light. It comes on. It goes off.      Please don't forget that these 'installation' artists don't actually create the objects they call art. Specialists create them on request. All the artists do is come up with the idea. Obviously Martin Creed thought long and hard before coming up with lights turning off and on.      I wish I could do that. Now that's what you should say if you look at art. Not, ""I could do that"". The Turner Prize has become a type of weird side show where so called artists try to think of the most mundane thing and call it art. Empty rooms, unmade beds. I don't think it will be to long before somebody submits nothing as their art.      How do I enter for the Turner Prize? It sounds like money for old rope. Now, there's an idea for my entry - a pile of old rope!       My entry for next year will be ""The light's on but nobody's home"". Maybe I should be one of the judges instead. "
HOC HOC-CL 9.47 " I don't want to sound alarmist, but if Mr.Hodges sacking goes unchallanged, then it could open the doors to more and more employers imposing draconian restrictions on their staff. It is not just an outrage, it is a criminal attack on a mans basic human right to freedom of lifestyle whithin the privacy of his own home. If anyone was in doubt about how much our employment rights have been eroded in recent times, then this case should convince them.      I believe it is perfectly in order not to hire smokers. Companies don't like to hire those addicted to pot smoking. Both are addictive and affect job performance. Although tobacco smokers don't get ""high"", they take frequent smoke breaks and cause a health hazard to other employees. Smokers that do without cigarettes during their time at work may become easily irritable because of the dependence on nicotine. (Yes, nicotine is a drug!) A worker can be hired once he/she has kicked their addiction on nicotine.      No one has the right to dictate how you should behave at home. The Soviet Union was criticised for interfering with individuals and taking away their individual rights, this just goes to show that capitalism is no better.      I can't believe what I just read! An employer has no rights on what you do in your personal life, as long as it isn't illegal. Smoking is not illegal, and certainly not in your own home. UK management is rife with this kind of authoritarian bullying. I hope he sues this company and that others lay off from prying in to what is not their concern. I live and work in the US, and I have to agree with an earlier post, that this keeps me from ever wanting to return and work in the UK. I am a non-smoker, but believe in one's personal rights to do whatever you want to do.      I suppose that if a contract had been signed which stipulated that he would be immediately dismissed if he was found to be a smoker, then his employers had every right to sack him. Still, it would be a silly clause to include in a contract of employment. I don't smoke, but I wouldn't want to work for any company that restricted their workers' private lives in such a ridiculous way.      Personal life, professional life, only one of these is for hire.      If my employer elected to fire me because he disapproved of any aspect of my domestic conduct, I would first politely explain to that person my views on their crass stupidity. Second, I would invite that person to my home and ask them to fire me on my own carpet. In the wake of what would immediately follow, I doubt if that employer would ever again repeat such a breathtakingly arrogant error of judgement.      This is discrimination of the worst kind. I used to be a shop steward in the UK whilst working for a local government authority. I thought I had seen it all then, with regard to employers' attitudes, but this takes the cake! How dare any employer tell you what you can and cannot do during the time he is NOT paying you. I hope that a civil liberties group will support Mark Hodges all the way to the European courts if necessary, to give this company a salutary lesson with regard to individual freedom and workers' rights. What someone does in their own home is their ownbusiness.     This story is outrageous. I can't believe anyone could be sacked for smoking at home in their own free time. Mind you, he's better off without them. Who'd want to work for a company like that! I just don't see how this can possibly be legal.      From a legal point of view, Mr Thompson, it depends on what the gentleman declared on his job application. If he smokes and he declared on his job application that he did not, then he is in breach of his contract, and has been untruthful to his employers. It is as simple as that. They may now feel that he has not been truthful about other matters on that application, and so the trust that they put in him to be straight with them has already gone. He may well have been employed in a job (food manufacturing, or healthcare for example) where the smell of nicotine, that, let's face it, lingers on clothes and breath would be a bad advertisement for that company when he is out selling their products, or in meetings with other executives. He has been caught out, and has to accept the consequences of being untruthful. If this is not the case, then he would have good grounds to sue the employer.      Speaking from bitter experience I know that British employers and managers are notorious bullies whose attitudes are rooted in Victorian times. I would seriously advise people to work for American (or other foreign) companies. They demonstrate a business culture based on equality and respect for their employees. Or try contracting. Or emigrate to a less hierarchical, class-obsessed country. I can promise you it works - I have done all three. Oh, and I'm a non-smoker.      We don't know the company and if there were particular reasons to be so strict - I suppose that a company involved in dealing with lung-cancer research or related damage claims could have a point. I smoke about 3 small cigars per year - does that make me smoker? Should I be fired? I think it would be good though, if smoking would be restricted to an area well away from public buildings. There is no way of getting in or out of a building without passing a curtain of smoke.      I can understand why firms would want to hire people with lower sickness rates and who are less likely to suffer from long-term illness during their working lives, even if I do think this is going a bit far.      This is the most idiotic thing I have heard. I don't smoke, and while I can appreciate a non smoking policy in the workplace, what people do in their own homes is entirely up to them. As far as I'm aware, smoking isn't illegal in the UK. It's nothing short of discrimination.      The only legitimate concerns of the company you work for with regards to what you do in your time are if you compromise your ability to do your job, or if you bring the company into disrepute. Beyond that companies need to stop behaving as if they have bought your soul rather than just rented your services for 40 hours a week.      I am British but presently live in the USA. I sometimes wonder about coming home, but issues like this make me want to stay away. ""An English man's home is his castle"", at least it used to be. As long as someone or something is not affecting your emotional or physical performance in your job, your boss should have no right to sanction you in any way. In fact I think this boss should be fired for discrimination or if it is a company owner, the company should be severely sanctioned for discrimination.      That's nonsense! I hope Mr Hodges is going to sue for unfair dismissal, because employers have no right to govern your behaviour outside of working hours. If it isn't illegal, and it doesn't affect your ability to do your job, then what you do in your own time is your business and nobody else's.      I am a non-smoker and would love to see a ban on smoking in all public places, however what people do in their own homes is nobody's business but their own.      As a non-smoker, it is irritating to see people taking sometimes constant ""fag-breaks"". However, if Mr Hodges did not do this then the company had no right to complain. I actually think it's scary that a company can try and dictate one's home life like this. Corporate mentality should not need to exist after 5.30! I hope Mr Hodges sues this company and wins.      If Mr Hodges has agreed to a contract that stipulates no smoking or has claimed to be a non-smoker on his application form then he has little cause to complain. If he smokes at home he will still smell like an ashtray at work and his physical health is likely to be worse than that of his non-smoking colleagues. Also the very fact that he is a smoker says something very negative about his personality. Anyone who risks serious health problems for the sake of a pathetic little self-gratification clearly has a serious problem.      So long as he does what he's being paid for, what he does outside of the company's premises is entirely his own business. He should sue for every penny he can get. Otherwise employers will have far too much power over employees' own time. It could get to the point where they won't hire amateur sportsmen for fear of having to pay them sick leave for sports injuries, or DIY enthusiasts in case they fall off the ladder. If you can do your job, why does it matter if (or even what) you smoke?      This is unfortunately not a new situation. A few years ago a worker was sacked for lighting a cigarette up in his car and he was pulling out of the company car park (which of course had a no smoking policy). I once worked for a very large utility company here in the UK that used to have a smoking room, which they then closed down. At lunch the staff would smoke outside on the company property, again the company asked them not to smoke on company premises. They really bit the biscuit when they tried to tell staff they couldn't smoke on the council owned pavement!      An employer has every right to choose whom he employs. He's going to pay the wages so why should he be expected to employ someone he sees as unsuitable, for whatever reason?       If the employer couldn't detect the stench of stale tobacco smoke on the man's clothes and on his breath, he wasn't interviewing him sufficiently. Those of us who don't want to have our environment polluted by this disgusting habit have every right to not associate with those who do. "
HOC HOC-FJ 9.08 " I agree that banning all smacking is over-legislation. However, I do agree that no child should ever be smacked on the head or shaken, and so criminalising this would be a good idea. This sort of chastisement is most likely to cause physical damage, and anyone with common sense ought to be able to see that.      Making criminals of parents who smack is not they way forward. Heaven help the social work profession (to which I belong) and the police child protection teams if we have to treat all parents who smack as criminals. Smacking is not the best way to provide good discipline - but many normal parents (including me) have smacked their children at times. Not good but not criminal.      If smacking is banned it should also be acceptable for anyone who becomes a victim of out-of-control children to sue the government department who implement the ban.      I feel smacking can be very effective. Just the other day, a gentleman cut me off while I was driving. Well, I chased him down and as soon as he got out of his car, I put him over my knee and gave him a couple of good smacks on the bottom. That'll be the last time he cuts another driver off.      I think there is nothing wrong with smacking a child, as long as it is within limits. My dad used to smack me for justified reasons and I think it made me a better person.      Some parents can't tell the difference between smacking and beating, so I say ban all physical violence against children. What are we, a nation of child abusers?      Before I was a father I thought that smacking a child was necessary. Now I have a 7-year-old daughter and have found, over time, that smacking does not work. As far as she is concerned being sent to her room is far worse a punishment than being smacked. The time alone in her room makes her think about what she has done, something a smack would not get her to do.      The new law is a waste of time and money. How do you expect to enforce such a law. There are bigger issues in Scotland, and the world today that need our immediate attention. I have two boys below the age of three, and occasionally they get a smack on the wrist or legs. It seems the people making these latest proposals could do with some of the same.      There's a world of difference between beating a child and an occasional smack. I believe that smacking should only be used when reasoned argument has been tried and failed, but children are not always reasonable, and a short sharp shock is often the best way to bring a child out of a tantrum. I always felt that smacking was a much more effective punishment than, say depriving a child of a meal as some of my anti-smacking neighbours did. No amount of reasoning will teach a small child not to touch something that is hot, and a smack hurts less than a burn.      Political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front. Spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm, that did not mean beat them to a pulp, it means simply correction by the last means, all else having failed. Is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values, until caught and hauled to juvenile court, when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong? Who is kidding who?      Let's get a sense of perspective on this: the occasional smack is not violent, nor is it abuse, nor is it assault. It is an effective way of temporarily correcting a child's behaviour. It has no long-term effects at all. The reason you should be allowed to smack a child but not an adult is because a child is incapable of judging effectively for itself whether or not its behaviour is right or wrong. Yes, children have no 'political power' - quite right too! They don't have the capacity to exercise it intelligently.      Banning smacking is only a good idea if parents are taught alternative means of behaviour correction. Otherwise, parenting becomes even more difficult.      A child is, like the rest us, constantly learning the limits of tolerance. More so it is important when he/she has to live in a community of people. Just because one declares an act to be unacceptable does not necessarily impart a child with the capacity nor the inclination to realise it. So it is as a last and effective resort that corrective action (such as smacking or the promise of the use of it) which is instinctively understood even by a child, be delivered. Used in a controlled and directed manner, there's no reason why smacking should not be part of a parent's educational tool for his/her child's healthy and balanced upbringing.      As I understand it, smacking is not a ""violent act"", neither is it to be used when running out of patience. I think it is one effective way of disciplining children, especially when they cannot understand reason. I think smacking is effective not because it inflicts pain (surely no-one can advocate beating children), but because it is humbling and a strong signal that certain behaviour is unacceptable. When I was smacked as a child I felt ashamed, and I have nothing but love and respect for my parents now.      The hysteria concerning child abuse is still raging and moving to ridiculous levels. Whatever next? Will punishing a child by not letting them out during the evening be classed as unlawful imprisonment? Parents need the freedom to punish their children in a way they see fit. Some children don't respond to reasonable discussion and physical punishment is sometimes the only sensible option. We need to pass on a clear message to children that they need to conform to rules otherwise suffer the consequences. If we fail to do so then crime will naturally increase as a consequence.      The discipline of children by smacking - for hundreds of generations and thousands of years - has helped to create the ordered society we have today. Over the past 30-40 years in the West, we've seen a marked reduction in the physical discipline of children as a result of so-called 'expert' advice. This should be more than enough time to see if reducing/eliminating smacking leads to a less violent world. Is this what we see? - I think not.      Political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front. Spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm, that did not mean beat them to a pulp, it means simply correction by the last means, all else having failed. Is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values, until caught and hauled to juvenile court, when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong? Who is kidding who?      I cannot see how this ban on smacking would be policed. If it serves only to create a yardstick by which courts make judgements, then the ""red tape"" argument banded about by the Scottish Conservatives is misplaced. Surely this will remove an element of the subjective nature from such decisions and give a fairer result.      Of course the ban is right, and should be in place for all children, not just the under threes. If society thinks that teaching a child that a violent act is the way to solve a problem, then society is crazy. Aside from this, the pain inflicted is sickening. Parents who physically strike or harm any child should be charged with child abuse.     I don't support violence against children, but a smacked bottom didn't do me any harm, and it didn't do my children any harm. It wasn't intended as a violent act, but as a firm signal that some lines must not be crossed. Children NEED lines to be drawn, and they can't always be drawn by discussion.     I am totally baffled as to how these ridiculous proposals actually get taken seriously. The idea that legislation like this will actually work is ludicrous. Once again the do-gooders manage to influence politicians. When will the politicians realise that standing up against nonsense like this will actually win votes. We, the general public, have finally had enough of politically correct twaddle      Anybody with young children knows that it is in a child's nature to push parents to establish what they can get away with and what they cannot. The occasional smack is not child abuse (a thoroughly repugnant accusation), it is a means of establishing these boundaries. I am not saying that everybody should smack their children - far from it - but undisciplined children eventually become somebody else's problem too - their school's - and these days, teachers are so limited in their powers to discipline pupils.      If a parent can be taken to court if they smack a child, can a child be taken to court if they kick, bite, hit or abuse their parents?      In response to Claire's comments; To say that there is so much violence in the world because of smacking is more than a little simplistic, and to say that smacking takes place because children ""have no political power"" is nothing short of absurd. Perhaps she could explain how a child who is prone to temper tantrums and will not listen to reason could be afforded a degree of political power? Does she seriously think that the misbehaving child who gets a smack will extract from this the sweeping principle that ""violence is a good way to solve problems"" and carry this principle into action on a grand scale in their own lives?      Future generations will be better off if they learn to manage the behaviour of their children without resorting to physically beating them. The love and comfort we bring to our children is seriously compromised when we start smacking.      It is quite understandable that people in charge of young children feel the overwhelming urge to clout a child who is trying their patience.      But if we accept the principle that this represents a failure not a solution, then in the end the whole of society would benefit from a growing generation who have been brought up in an atmosphere of non-violence.      The only person qualified to smack under 3 year-olds is the midwife.      Smacking a child is not a means to wilfully or maliciously inflicting harm on them. Most times it's the last course of action taken to making them know that what they are doing is wrong and it should be stop immediately.     For most parents in the UK, I'm sure that smacking is a necessary and vital part of bringing your child in the way they should grow. I was smacked, many times, and hold no animosity towards my parents.      A well-deserved smack followed by an explanation and a hug is still the best parental guidance in the world. The inability to differentiate between discipline and child abuse is typical of an out-of-touch bureaucracy.      This society says we have freedom, but it constantly tells us what do, how to bring our children up, what we wear, how we are to worship, how we are to dress and eat. They say smacking is against the human rights of a child, but I say smacking gives the child boundaries.      You cannot discipline a child with hugs and kisses, you have to use force once in a while. If children are not disciplined then we will bringing up children that will have no respect for themselves or any one else.      I know first-hand that child abuse is very real. A law that makes hitting punishable would send a strong message to parents to try other ways to discipline. I have two children and think perhaps government funded education of some sort would help parents combat any anger-management issues they may have and learn a better way to discipline.      Reading the responses of people here, it is no wonder that there is so much violence in the world. When people smack their children, they teach them that violence is a good way to solve problems.     The hypocrisy is also astonishing. If a person ""smacks"" a stranger, he can be arrested for assault. Yet, he is allowed to hit his child. Why? Because children have no political power. This is undoubtedly one of society's worse evils.      I have raised one child and am in the process of raising three more. I have, on occasion swatted all of them. Those times have been rare but appropriate. They are all great kids and I don't believe our relationships could be better. I am glad most of your readers have enough common sense to know the difference between discipline and abuse.      I personally believe there are many ways to punish a child that don't involve physical violence. Violence of any form has no place in a modern society.      Nobody is in favour of abusing children in any way - but a smack isn't abuse. Raising doubts about the legality of a wee smack is going to bring nightmarish problems. Children need protection and parents need support. This proposal, if it comes to law, will bring in far more problems then it solves, and we'll regret it. It's one of those over-simple ""it feels right so let's do it"" ideas.      For a long time here in Sweden smacking has been equal to assault. The kids who get smacked can call a help-line to talk about their problems.      Whenever I smacked my child it always came from any frustration I was then going through. I would regret it later, but always think of the maxim ""spare the rod and spoil the child"". Given our children's lax attitude to life today, would not some discipline help tomorrow's grown-up? "
HOC HOC-FY 9.94 " I think it's the human factor that really determines whether alcohol is good or bad. If the user can hold his drink and not confuse reality with his or her state of mind when under the influence of alcohol, then it really can't be bad for anyone. But sadly, in most cases the dangers of alcohol are propounded by the user losing control and thus setting off a whole chain of events which can destroy relationships and lives.      My granddad swore by having one glass of wine with lunch, and one glass with dinner - he would only drink wine that was free of unnatural ingredients, mind. Anyway, he did that every day of his life, was fit as a fiddle, and lived to 93!      You die if you worry, you die if you don't. You may as well have a nice relaxing drink while waiting! I don't know what you mean, I'm as Jober as a Sudge!      Now, which side of the story is true and correct? As read in the weekly newspaper of Nepal, it says alcohol destroys the enzyme system - the most important cell in the human body. And to drink alcohol is to drink arsenic, cyanide and strychnine. And the alcoholic drink causes diseases like esophagitis, assmitis, peptic ulcer, colon disease, rectum cancer etc etc. Also it causes damage in the intestine and it effects our heart. Let us know the right advice, because I am really mixed up!      Alcohol is an extremely dangerous and highly addictive drug. I believe that if a drug company were to apply for a license to supply alcohol on prescription today it would be refused. It is generally availible in every corner shop and on every form of transport you can think of, and is consumed in highly variable quantities (for a tranquilliser). Unfortunately it is so deep rooted in our culture that it is still regarded as normal. Twenty years ago smoking seemed a normal thing to do and I think that in 20 years time alcohol will be viewed in the same way we view smoking today.      Small amount of alcohol with delicious fat-free food would work good for the body.      A wise man once said, "" A herd of buffalo is only as fast as the slowest one, this goes for brain cells as well. Whilst drinking alcohol is said to kill brain cells, the weakest ones will be picked off first - leaving the strong ones to work faster"". Cheers!      I think drinking is not bad, but if you make it a habit, it's really bad both for the person and the family. Moreover I have seen people taking alcohol in the presence of their children which I am sure makes a bad impact on them, as they learn everything from their elders. So one should think a lot and try not to get addicted to it.      It's not just the alcohol, but the setting. If it's in a social setting where you are relaxing, feeling accepted and loved and enjoying a laugh and maybe a good home-cooked meal, these are all healthy influences. I doubt that drinking alone in misery does anyone any good.     A lot of alcohol research is sponsored by companies with interests in that industry. It would be nice if journalists checked up to find out who sponsored the research rather than re-gurgling the many ""alcohol is healthy"" press releases. Alcohol is the biggest killer of males under 29 and here is a story asking if it is good for you?      A day without wine is a day without sunshine - enjoy! Life is too short to quibble      To quote Homer Simpson, ""Beer, the cause of, and solution to, all of lifes problems"".      What on earth is Claire on about ""Apart from anything else, alcohol is extremely high in calories""? What? Alcohol is not high in calories (beer can be but alcohol isn't), and even IF it was what is the problem with that? It's like saying rice is bad for you as it's extremely high in calories. Sheesh!      Phew! After all that I could murder a pint.      Of course the Spanish report is correct - and the same results would be found if the survey were carried out in other Mediterranean countries. There, people drink in an absolutely different way from Northern Europe and Northern America. I have seen grandmothers offering watered wine to 4 year olds and there are no nannyish laws regarding the age of drinkers or opening hours. One doesn't have to be a rocket scientist to work out that alcohol per se is not the problem. Alcoholics and the societies which breed them have more profound problems - such as family breakdown, inability to express anger, unemployment, poverty etc. If northern governments want to curb alcoholism they should take a long look at the southern European countries and the vastly different attitudes and lifestyle that prevail there. To conclude, is it not extremely patronising to discount the Spanish survey because you yourself have had a different experience?      As the great Homer J Simpson once said, ""Alcohol, the cause of and the cure for all life's problems!""      One of the first things that is impaired when we drink is our judgement. So how can drinkers say for sure that they feel healthier? Perhaps it's just the drink talking?      If you enjoy a drink to relax after work - fine. If you NEED a drink then you should think again.      It's the excess and abuse that causes the problems. Such things as smoking can't be practised easily in moderation because of their high addictiveness. but we must also consider the social implications of our free alcohol society, with the violence and influence on families at home when excessive drinking comes into play.      Sorry - I can't agree with the Spanish report. Apart from anything else, alcohol is extremely high in calories, and even a small amount affects one's judgement. 20 years ago, when lunchtime drinking was the norm at work, everyone was practically asleep at their desks in the afternoon! I know that I feel 100% better now that I drink a couple of times a year, rather than when I tippled on a regular basis.      If you can drink in moderation - great. You're lucky. I'm sure that such drinking will do you no harm at all and will even be enjoyable and helpful to you in your social life. However, there are some of us who can't drink at all and have to stay away from it at all costs because it becomes massively destructive to both ourselves and those around us. I was born into a family in which alcoholism is hereditary and seems to run down the male line. Just about every male relative of mine is or has been an alcoholic, and surprise surprise, I seem to be blessed with it too. What a wonderful legacy! The only thing I can do is stay away from alcohol at all times if I want any semblance of a normal life. It has already cost me many many relationships in the past!      You've no idea what a nightmare it is. It requires constant vigilance for the rest of your life. And if you're an alcoholic, you're always an alcoholic. You can't heal yourself, you can only choose whether you 'practice' or not. Other 'normal' people who have never experienced alcoholism either in themselves, or in others, simply can't understand. So I wouldn't worry about the health effects of a few drinks. Compared to this nightmare it's nothing!      I can't see what the fuss about alcohol is about. Many things are good for you, such as regular exercise. It seems the latest research provides a wonderful to go on drinking. You only have to look at our culture of alcohol-related violence and sickness to know that the research is NOT true!      To say that you don't believe the report on the grounds that the Quran bans drinking (Ahmed, UK) is like saying that sex is bad for you because Catholic priests abstain from it and that pork is bad for you because Jews and Muslims don't eat it. Not everything that a religion forbids is necessarily bad for you - it may be to teach you a different lesson.      A little of what you fancy can be very good thing, specially if someone else is buying.      Alcohol was fine, even Jesus used to have a spot of wine with his meals. Providing we don't down 6 pints each night, a few glasses of whatever during the day isn't going to do any harm. It's only people who drink to excess that harm themselves, or those around themselves. Alcohol doesn't make people violent - they are violent already, besides surely the report is looking at the effects to the consumer?      I drink a moderate amount of beer every day; but I exercise and eat well. And, unlike some teetotallers, I do not smoke, drive a car, or ride a bicycle in traffic, any of which is far more daUKngerous than having a few bottles of beer at the end of the day.      What the survey about Spanish drinkers failed to mention is that any good the drinking does to the health is totally nullified by their constant smoking - even in this office!      Isn't the old story? ""Everything in moderation"". Drinking chilled wine while cooking on the barbecue is a great pastime - very relaxing!      It is an indisputable fact that excessive amounts of alcohol over a prolonged period are very likely to be bad for you. However, moderate drinking, as well as being very enjoyable, can also help to relieve problems brought about by the effects of stress and as a way of unwinding can be very therapeutic. The sooner this country wakes up to continental opening hours, whereby people will not feel they have to guzzle copious quantities in a short period, the less drink-related crime we will be subjected to also.      I'm a big believer that anything you use or consume can kill you. We see more focus on the things that the general populace do or use, like drinking, smoking or using a mobile phone - none of these are good for you, apparently. Have there been studies into excessive eating of lettuce or consumption of lemonade? If there have, you don't hear about them - maybe we should! As for drinking, it's never done me any harm, hic!      I am a Muslim, and according to Koranic Law alcohol is forbidden to all Muslims. It is bad for you. Period. This study is a complete farce. I don't believe a word of it.      Having read Bridget Jones Diary I think my drinking habits are moderate! Maybe what makes alcohol good for you is when you share the experience with friends and family and develop and sustain positive relationships with others. The image of drinking out of compulsion and on your own is my idea of the stereotypical alcoholic!      My old man practiced law for 64 years and drank no less than a pint of sour mash whiskey every day of his adult life until he retired at 89. He lived until he was 91. I think it was retirement, rather than whiskey that brought him down.      I cannot agree that alcohol is good. Anyone who wants proof, should count the bruises when my drunk ex husband and I had a fight the other night. How many women have to suffer because someone likes a drink? He can sober up and go out - I have to wait till the bruises go.      I have to admit I have a problem with alcohol. It's paying so much tax on it. Apart from that, I'm convinced that worrying about drinking a glass of wine or two does you more damage that the alcohol in the wine itself....      A little of what is bad for you does you the world of good.      It can't be good for you. I feel absolutely terrible this morning.      The drinking of alcohol per se is not the issue. A glass of two of red wine with a daily evening meal is good for you, but it's only when that glass or two turns into a bottle or two (especially of hard liquor!) that the alarm bells should start to ring. The benefits or otherwise of alcohol depend on the user, not the alcohol.      I find that drinking alcohol is often the only way to endure boring parties and work functions. After all, nothing drags on more slowly than a social occasion when you're staying sober and everyone else is having a tipple. "
HOC HOC-HI 7.7 " How can all those opposed to this process not see their hypocrisy. If you eat meat, you are taking the life of a fully conscious and aware being, purely for the purposes of gratification. The possible benefits of stem cell research far outweigh those of killing a conscious being just for the sake of eating it and at a far lesser moral price.      A lot of the hostile reaction to this development is based on ignorance. We are a long way from being able to ""design"" babies. One thing the human genome project showed us is just how vastly complex it is. In the mean time if this research offers the prospect of preventing serious human suffering, then why on earth not pursue it?      If stem cell harvesting will in any way reduce the inhuman use of animals in ""research"" then I am all for it.      It's very worrying when a society begins to decide what is alive and what isn't through subjective parameters. How do people know when the spirit enters this so-called 'bundle of cells'? Don't NASA space satellites through deduction tell us that 98% of the actual universe is unseen? So maybe on a merely sight-based level, these poor souls appear as a bundle of cells, but what about on the sub-atomic level, and below? There is so much we don't know, so how can we let scientists use their privileged position without every fact being scrutinised? And, by the way, isn't DNA small, miniscule, a blob of proteins, yet no one calls their importance meaningless!      As a molecular biologist, I used to think that stem cell research should be allowed. After my daughter was born, I began to abhor it -because every embryo has the potential, given the chance, to be a conscious being and a precious child.      I see little difference between the conjoined egg/sperm and the sperm and egg cells that existed before they conjoined. These are not yet human beings. If we choose to protect these, then what ethical considerations are given for sperm cells or egg cells, or the cells we destroy as we perform surgery on humans or the DNA strands derived from human cells that we use for research now?      It is simply one more modern form, maybe a ""civilised"" one at that, of cannibalism. Only we are all already so demented and egotistic, we cannot recognise that bare fact anymore.      An embryo may, given the right circumstances, be able to become a human being. But so does a sperm cell have the possibility of providing half the genetic material for a human being. I for one am an adult and would resent being forced into sex for procreation only. A parallel argument implies that the research should be done but that the products of said research should come with a warning label; do not use this product if embryo dissection worries you. Guess what. I bet all the pro-life (i.e. pro impose your morals on everyone else) lot would still use the resulting products if they needed them.      How long is it going to be before embryos will be seen just like pieces of meat in a butcher shop? It's bad enough killing off our old people with euthanasia. Now we want to start at the other end. Where's it all going to end!      If you can answer which came first the chicken or the egg, you can decide what to do in this case. If you cannot, as I suspect the majority can't, then you can't decide on this issue. If you cannot decide on this issue, then I would have thought the logical thing is to defer on the side of higher authority. The highest authority is unknown but it's definitely not man. Call it God/Force or the great mystery -whatever. But why does man think He can solve it all? Don't humans realise that life is lived in the unknown and the unexpected? Otherwise there is no life to be lived. What is the point of solving all diseases anyway? To live forever? to the maximum? What kind of life is that? Wake up to your senses, modern man!      You cannot stop this research. You may think it is wrong, but the potential rewards make it unstoppable. This argument boils down to morality versus need. The need is overwhelming and the morality takes second place. When you need a procedure just to stay alive, then you can choose to not use the ill-gotten knowledge of embryonic research because God doesn't like it. (Yeah, right!)      Isn't embryo selection quite the same thing? Doctors create embryos in the knowledge that most of them will be destroyed. But that's considered ethical, because it eliminates the chance that a handicapped baby will be born. I don't know at which point life starts, but I know one thing: I wouldn't have a clear conscience if I were responsible for the destruction (stem cell research, embryo selection, abortion...) of embryos.      If human embryos can be created for investigating infertility problems and then discarded, why can't they be created for stem cell research alone? Embryonic stem cells are just theoretically supposed to cure the degenerative diseases, we should now be assured through practical research whether they are precisely helpful or not. If they are proved to be really mercurial, we should think of better ideas to obtain human embryos. We should never start a business of human sperm or ova, but can consider the creation of human embryos from the ones who wish to donate their eggs for their own cause.      Ahhh the classic ethical argument pitting the arrogance of science versus the superstitions of the masses. Since almost all research is fuelled by commercial concerns, you have to wonder about all the money that is at stake. Money, as you well know, has a tendency to make all ethical arguments irrelevant.      I agree with M. Moran's comment. An embryo cannot feel pain or know of its own existence. Therefore, if we can use these embryos to learn more about the human body, why not take advantage of this? Who knows the kinds of disease we may better understand and be able to cure? Someday, the life of one of your loved ones could be saved by the research they are doing today.      I seem to recall that Sir Isaiah Berlin spoke of the ""tragic choices of liberty"". This certainly seems to be one of them! For me, the gold standard of treating something or someone ethically is how it affects the self-aware being. That quality of mind is to be nurtured and preserved at all costs. That is where the sanctity lies. If manipulating certain cell types brings a net gain in self-aware beings, I cannot see what is wrong with it.      Objectively, this process seems very questionable. Have scientists become body ""mechanics"", producing spare parts at any price? Subjectively, however, if any one of us or our loved ones fell victim to some dreadful degenerative disease, can we be so sure we wouldn't go to almost any lengths to try and beat it?      I am in two minds. Morally I do not like the idea of using embryos in research. However, the research can be used to help find the cure to many diseases. Sometimes these issues are portrayed as 'black and white' in order to play on your feelings, when they are a lot more complex.      Those who protest against these procedures as being 'unnatural' are deceiving themselves. We have stopped evolution long ago. Unless you wish to give up pre-natal care, all fertility treatments, c-sections and all sorts of other 'unnatural' birth assistance, get used to the brave new world of playing God. Actually, come to think of it, we have already been doing just that for thousands of years already.      If the embryo was created from the eggs and sperm of voluntary donors, yes. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. I appreciate that there is an ethical problem, but surely if embryos can potentially be used to cure cancer, HIV/Aids or other diseases, this is worth far more in the long term.      It's a travesty of human rights and justice that this type of activity is allowed. Embryo is a word used to dull our consciences.      The crux of this argument seems to be around the point at which life begins. I too cannot say at which exact point I believe life starts, but I must disagree with those that see a group of non-specific cells as life. These are only the potential for life, in the same way that each individual sperm has the capability to produce a very unique individual. Fertilisation does not create life, it only creates the possibility for life.      I wonder if people who are against stem cell research are aware how many embryos are destroyed by nature (or God if you prefer)? Conception is not a single instantaneous event inevitably leading to the birth of a human being but a process which takes place over a period of about a week and is fraught with dangers along the way. Only about 40 percent of embryos eventually implant to establish a pregnancy - the rest have defects which prevent implantation from taking place. And of those which do implant about 30 per cent will be lost in the first three months of pregnancy. Nature - or God - is profligate.      I think that there is a natural balance in the world, and when we interfere somewhere in that balance, a response will be triggered. ""Every action has an equal and opposite reaction."" Therefore if we dabble in nature's way like this, nature will have to re-balance/ react. It seems that scientists don't realise this, or choose to overlook it. As such, I am led to believe that scientists and doctors ""in the name of medicine"" will try to counter nature, and push and push and the balance will be thrown out further.      I have no doubt in my mind that this technology should be used. Uneducated religious fanatics are over sentimental and irrationally provoked by terms such as human embryo. Stem cells from human embryos can be used in the treatment of many conditions and we would be fools not to exploit it to its maximum potential.      How sad it is to see some people believe embryos deserve no ethical consideration. It's disturbing because their arguments, which generally reduce sentience to some kind of behaviour trait such as 'interaction', would also remove all rights from those who are comatose or even those who are asleep.      We have to respect God's will towards Nature.      It does not matter if the embryo is not sentient. It has the potential to develop into a living, breathing human being, which could lead a full and wonderful life that matters. What right do we have to start something like that only to take it away almost immediately? As adults we have certain responsibilities to our children who are not yet developed enough to take care of themselves. We really need to stop and think about this. It is not the only way.      As a diabetic, I welcome the opportunity to find a cure. Stem cell research is vital to achieve this. Perhaps it's selfish, but I don't fancy the greatly increased risk of complications such as blindness, toe amputations and heart attacks that I face. And I don't enjoy the daily rituals of testing my blood levels by pricking my fingers and inserting needles into my stomach six times a day to avoid a coma either. This research represents hope that I can live the life that others lead. Oh to play a game of football without a second thought about medications. Or to be able to eat normal food whenever I wanted. Perhaps it's not so selfish, because there are millions more like me.      Total reactionary poppycock put about by religious fanaticists who care less about their fellow human beings than they do themselves. Are they saying that one person is more valuable than another? That a human being with a life-threatening illness who is raising a family and doing a worthwhile job is worth less than a collection of cells that might grow up to be a child abuser or a murderer? If all life is sacred, then how can you justify saving a non-sentient ball of cells instead of a fully functional human being?      An embryo in its early stages of development may not be sentient but it has the potential to become a fully-grown person like you or me.      In terms of ethics, this issue on its own is no more sensitive than the abortion debate - if that wasn't enough. The argument over whether embryos qualify as human is old news and something that everyone is never going to agree on. What really worries me is where it will go from here. Where will it end? Having specially genetically modified humans born simply for the purpose of organ donation? If you ask me, a line has to be drawn somewhere.      It's just plain ignorant to condemn a technology that holds promise for curing millions of people. It's time we as a civilisation realised that religion has been holding back scientific progress for too long.      If there is any lesson to be learned from the science of genetics it is surely that we are ""who we are"" from the moment of conception, not from the moment of birth. This kind of research is seriously wrong. It isn't even necessary - adult stem cell research is showing far better results, as evidence grows suggesting that embryonic stem cells are too unstable.      So human embryos have been used and discarded for many years. However scientists can always make up a valid excuse for tests they want to perform. Where do we draw the line? I can see people might benefit from this research but, if we keep pushing the boundaries, eventually the line of decency and ethics will be crossed.      There is no reason that anyone could give which would lead me to change my opinion on this. It is manifestly wrong to create life and then to destroy it.      I honestly don't know why people wouldn't want to use this technology. Learning how to do this is part of our evolution and if we ignore or reject technology like this based on our fears, well we will just be doing ourselves harm in the long run. Of course you will always get some people kicking up a fuss about this, a 150 years ago these were the people who thought electricity was the work of the devil.      This is disgraceful. We should not be using human life as a means to an end. We were all embryos once, and IVF children were embryos created in a lab. I would not want some scientist deciding if I should live or die. This is a step too far.      In the early stages of development an embryo is nothing more than an amorphous ensemble of cells. The embryo is not sentient. It has no individuality, interests or capacity for suffering. It is utterly oblivious as to its own existence. In this respect, to accord any ethical significance to an embryo is as irrational as fretting over the dismantling of an unwanted wristwatch.      Opponents of stem cell harvesting accord a ""sanctity"" to embryonic existence. Yet there is nothing specific to justify this sanctity. Crudely put, ethics arise due to interactions between individuals and the adversity that they incur and/or perceive. In the first few months of its development an embryo can neither perceive nor interact and therefore does not warrant any ethical consideration whatsoever.      No today, no tomorrow and no for eternity. No one has the right to play God but that is exactly what this is. The US dictates its opinions in so many areas and is looking to add this truly abhorrent practice to the rest. It may not be the place for the rest of the world to dictate to the US on their individuals' rights to 'bear arms' as indeed it is not the place of the US to dictate to the rest of mankind on when life begins and when life ends.      Stem cells can be harvested from the fat cells of liposuction surgery but this isn't a very profitable source of income to the medical industry. I believe that a sperm + egg is a person with a soul and rights. Creating these people in order to kill them is very profitable to the medical industry. I think that creation of people for body parts which may be used in such trivial pursuits such as cosmetic surgery is about on an equal par with breeding slaves and discarding them when are no longer useful.      One does not have to be an ""uneducated religious fanatic"" to oppose stem cell research. I am an agnostic attending one of the most prestigious universities in America, and I am against it. As soon as an embryo is created, that embryo has a genetic structure distinct from its parents, and is thus a separate organism, a separate human. We were all once at this stage of development. I find it repugnant that anyone could have chosen whether I was worthy of existence any time after the sperm touched the egg. Ethically and logically, it's no different than murder.      I understand the concerns people have. I read one article that asked why we want to cure disease. It's not because we want to live forever. For me personally, it's so that I can live at all. So that I can wake up in the morning knowing that the day will not be filled with pain and suffering. And for the millions of other people whom every day rely on this research.      Don't mess with Mother Nature! Stemming, cloning, where will it end? I can see that we'll all be sorry one day! "
HOC HOC-JQ 8.61 " Camelot should not break the rules and shame on Chris Smith suggesting that they should pay up! Anyway, haven't the Totts earned a considerable sum from the newspapers for making an act of stupidity into a news item? They are better off than they were, so what is the problem?      Bottom line - did they or did they not hand the ticket in before the deadline? No, therefore they lost, as you would in any other competition.      I think they should pay out the money to the last but one winner.      Hands up all those who had teachers who fell for the ""dog ate my homework"" excuse! Same difference - the responsibility is on the user to protect their piece of paper. The rule is clear - no ticket, no claim.      They should have read the regulations in the small print. Where is the small print? On the back of the lost ticket!      I can't believe that this is actually ""news"". The lottery rules state that unless the winning ticket is produced, no payment is made. End of story. Why should Camelot make an exception? The couple knew perfectly well the rules and conditions when they bought their ticket, why should they change just because they were stupid enough to lose it?      When a government minister says Camelot should pay up regardless of their carefully kept rules to avoid fraud, then we can see the row for what it really is - a cheap attempt to have us argue the toss on a totally irrelevant matter compared to the mess of foot-and-mouth. Biggs and Co are also providing a clever diversion - who needs spin doctors when you have the Sun?      The rules are quite clear. If you wish to claim a prize then do not lose your ticket. It is as simple as that!      I think Camelot are right in their decision. What proof do they have that the people won the prize without seeing the ticket? It's called ""hard cheese"", careless people. It would be unfair for them to have the money without proof, as many others won't have won anything at all either - they just have to keep trying like the rest of us and be more careful with their tickets. Anyone can say they won the money but lost a ticket - who's to know who is being honest?      I can't understand how anyone can buy a ticket in a lottery and then not look to see if they have won. It's tough luck, but follow the rules that you agreed to when you bought the ticket.      I believe I'm right in saying that to collect Premium Bond prizes over a certain value you have to produce the actual winning bond, even though Ernie will have a record of your name and address. Obviously if Camelot paid out in this instance then the rules for ALL competitions which require the production of ticket would have to be changed, wouldn't they?      Give them the money! If they have proved they bought the ticket then they deserve to get their prize. Nobody deserves to think they are going to be millionaires only to be told go away and try again.      This is not an attempt at fraud, Camelot are satisfied that the ticket was purchased and the claimants purchased it. To all who say 'rules is rules', you won't go through life without coming up against unbending officialdom. It's frustrating when it's a library book fine, when it's 3 million quid I think a little compassion and commonsense is needed. I think Camelot should advertise unclaimed prizes over #1000 at the outlets where the tickets were sold.      The 30 day rule is not very apparent and was little known until this case. Camelot ARE satisfied that the couple were genuine winners. Paying them out would not lead to a flood of claims as each claim has to be verified anyway. I think Camelot should pay out, OR should make sure the rules are published were everyone can see them. Why didn't Camelot tell the couple straight away about the 30 day rule, instead of making them wait 45 days?      The media must really be scraping the barrel for stories if losing a lottery ticket is considered so important.      Much as it pains me to say it, as I do not approve of Camelot, the company is quite correct in refusing to pay. Imagine the queue of 'lost ticket' claims every week from now on if Camelot were to concede this claim.      I forgot to buy a lottery ticket but would have picked the correct numbers. Surely Camelot should have compassion and pay me! A. they bought a ticket and didn't check the numbers. B. They lost the ticket. C. They failed to claim for the lost ticket within the 30 days. Sounds like they should be happy that they remembered where they lived when returning from the newsagent in the first place.      People would change their tune if it were their ticket. We are all human, we all make mistakes and lose things - Camelot should pay up. This is NOT their money to keep. I think the Government should make them pay up or withdraw their license to print money! If Camelot thought this was going to happen to them, I bet the couple would have the cheque in their bank before they could blink.      Rules are rules. It's a real pity for that particular couple but there is no point in having regulations if you do not stick by them.      While my sympathies do go to the claimants, I have to side with Camelot on this one. The rules of the lottery apply to everyone and a thing like the lottery would turn into a mockery if the rules could be bent or broken whenever someone feels hard-done-by. I would have a lot more sympathy if they had the ticket but fell outwith the normal claim window, but we are talking about a lost-ticket claim and people should feel damned lucky that they get 30 days at all - as one guy from the states said here, it maybe should be no ticket - no prize. I wonder if people can claim if they forgot to actually buy the ticket, even though they get the same numbers every week...      What a pair of pratts! No ticket, no proof, and therefore no prize. Anyone could claim they bought the winning ticket then lost it. Maybe this couple did always buy a ticket but forgot this time!! Hence the reason why they are kicking themselves now. That's the whole point - who knows! Bad luck to this couple but hardly a tragedy      I think it is sad the couple lost their tickets but the rules and regulations should be kept in this country. Anyone can say they lost their tickets when there is no claim of a winning ticket. I strongly feel in UK the rules and laws should be kept as it is. Rules are there to be obeyed and the British should obey them not break them. I think the couple are very selfish to ask Camelot to pay them. I don't think they are entitled to anything. Sorry!      We agree that Camelot must not pay the prize to this couple. Rules have to be kept. They were not responsible enough to take care of their ticket. They had the opportunity to claim within 30 days, and they didn't claim in this period. The argument of compassion is not relevant in this case. Beside, the other winners, don't have the same rights, and this ""stressed"" couple simply had bad luck. No ticket, no prize.      If Camelot are satisfied that the people have genuinely won then they should pay out on compassionate grounds. But the 30-day claim rule is a bad one. It should simply be no ticket, no pay out. That would get rid of any doubt and be fair. The other 114 ""winners"" who claimed this particular prize show the need for an unambiguous rule.      The comments made by Culture Secretary Chris Smith to give them the money were nothing less than cynical vote catching. The couple said on TV that the stress of this dispute was putting their marriage at risk. I think this sort of comment is a sad reflection on Britain in the 21st century when money and celebrity are all. They lost the ticket, tough luck. It is their own fault. Don't give them the money.      Of course in the small print it probably says they don't have to pay if they don' feel like it. Get Premium bonds instead - they always pay out no matter how late the claim!.      A 30-day claim period for winnings is very convenient for Camelot. It saves them a lot of work and so of course they don't want to bend the rules. Having spent 15 years in the gambling business I think 5 years should be the minimum, especially because, as most people don't expect to win, they are not too prompt when it comes to checking their ticket. I personally am bad at checking my tickets. (When I do get one on a rollover). It's the disappointment of looking and finding I've only got one number.      Give them a million then they have both scored.      There has to be a time when you accept your misfortune. They should accept reality and stop whinging.      Living in the US, I am amazed that the UK lottery would even consider paying out on a lost ticket. Not an option here. You either have the winning ticket or you don't.      So the money goes to worthy causes, to be honest I can't see how you can argue against that when it is entirely within the rules.      Bravo to Camelot for giving it to charity when for certain sections of the media perversely that seems to be the wrong decision. They've made a potentially unpopular choice but one that will benefit charities, Camelot should be applauded.      Camelot are being utterly mean and cruel. They talk about precedent, but personally I think they are doing more harm to their image with the mercenary treatment they are giving this couple now. How can you let ticket-holders get so close only to tell them that on some mundane legal technicality hidden in the fine print they just missed out on the dream of a lifetime? Camelot should have used their discretion. Rules should not preclude compassion or else we are living with Big Brother.      In Spain, if you play the lottery and you lose your ticket, you cannot claim for it and you won't get the prize money. Additionally, if someone finds your ticket, it becomes their ticket and not yours. We don't understand why it is such a great subject of discussion.      Graeme, England: You make a rather sweeping statement in saying everyone wants a non-profit lottery. The bottom line is who will offer the most money for good causes and the biggest prizes. If the company that does this also happens to make a profit then it is still in the best interests of the public. As for not having say in things that affect you, if you don't like it don't play it simple as that.      You miserable bunch of curmudgeons! I think that when an absolute one-off like this happens, I really don't see the harm in showing a little compassion and good will and paying out. You'd all change your tune, if it were you who had lost out!      Why should Camelot pay out this time around? I won #1.5m but forgot to claim within the allotted time of 30 days. You don't hear me complaining now, do you?      As they say: ""you lose... you lose!""      Camelot have had their share of controversy recently and this is yet another PR blunder. The error was not in their decision not to pay out, but in their decision to investigate the ticket at all. They should have simply said that the claim period for lost tickets had expired and left it at that. I really do feel for the unfortunate Totts, who were by inference led to believe that their claim might have been upheld.      Rules are for the blind obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men. I forget who once famously said that, but it doesn't matter; the point is, of course Camelot should pay out. The couple clearly won. What we are seeing is the completely business like side of a large organisation with absolutely no flexibility and no interpersonal responsibility. It would be nice to see a more human side to both Camelot and the general public.      Play by the rules - if Camelot refused to pay out on a ticket less than 180 days old then we would all be outraged - so why expect them to pay out on a ticket which is invalid? As for Mrs Tott's comment that this is the worst form of torture, I think a reality check is long overdue!      Why should Camelot pay up if the rules have not been observed? Paying sets a precedent and rewards stupidity. In any case, don't unclaimed prizes go to good causes? It isn't a case of Camelot keeping the #3 million for their coffers. At least the couple involved have been able to sell their stories to the tabloids for a bit of cash to soften the blow.      It is the player's responsibility to abide by the rules before agreeing to play the game. They should have simply claimed within the appropriate time limits. For #3 million I would have made very sure I did!      In order to claim a lottery prize, the only piece of evidence that is required is the lottery ticket. Is that too much to ask? Although, the situation regarding the Totts is really unfortunate, they lost their ticket and therefore should not be entitled to get a prize.      In any game there are rules. If you don't play by the rules, you cannot win the game. Anyway this couple's shameless exploitation of the media to try and win sympathy from the public has certainly backfired on me. Did anyone see the interview where the guy talked about ""having to keep a bottle of Jack Daniels by his bed to sleep"". I may have had some sympathy with a case presented differently.      I think they should move on and get off our TV screens! I'm a believer of fate and if it was destined to be yours, then it would have been yours. At the moment, they are being used by media to try to pull ratings. Try again this Saturday like everyone else.      Haven't we rather forgotten that the lottery is supposed to benefit good causes, and isn't just a get rich quick scheme? By sticking to the letter of the rules, the operator has guaranteed that the good causes benefit. If winning the lottery is so important, then take better care of the ticket.      I know that if it were me I would be utterly convinced that Camelot should pay. The trouble is that it isn't me and so I find myself thinking that the rules are clear and were set at the lottery's inception and therefore to be fair to all, they should be observed.      There's a lot of vindictive commentators on this one. They won, Camelot agrees that they won so it should pay - undermines the integrity of the lottery indeed. Yes they were daft to lose the ticket but for Camelot to keep them hanging on for seven weeks just to re-confirm that they weren't going to pay out is nothing short of torture. Still, I think it's very noble of everyone else who has commented so far to agree that if they were in the Tott's position they'd just shrug their shoulders and say 'Ah well, win some, lose some.'      Technically, the Totts have no right to a prize because they have no proof of winning. Rather than relying on 14 million to one longshots, they should use their entrepreneurial abilities and make the money through their own efforts.     As much as I think Camelot should have lost its license to run the lottery I must agree with them on this one. Stick to the rules - it's not like they're missing out on something they've worked hard for, get on with your lives!      As someone who thinks that the lottery is the best scheme yet devised to get the poor to pay for the recreation of the rich it seems to me that Camelot should pay up. In this game of chance it should be the chance of choosing the numbers that matters not the skill in keeping the ticket!      There are millions of people living on or very near to the breadline in Britain who buy and religiously check their lottery ticket for winners. This couple simply lost theirs, unfortunately such is life - no payout. Perhaps Camelot should donate the money to charity.      Legally, there is no obligation on Camelot to pay up. However, I think that in this particular case it is only just and equitable that they do. Yes, the winners should have kept the ticket or claimed early etc, but the fact that Camelot admits it knows they are the true winners should mean that they pay up. It will not open floodgates, as it would be in Camelot's discretion as to who they admit to be true winners in the future. I also think the winners should then donate most of the money to charity, but that's another story!      I wonder how many of the people who agree with Camelot not paying out would say the same thing if for some unfortunate turn of events they were in the same position. OK, rules are rules but why is it a 30 day rule when Camelot have admitted that they are sure the Totts are telling the truth? Camelot were quick enough to get the decision of the Lottery Commission to only deal with the Richard Branson lottery bid. Double standards?      These people claim the ""stress"" is straining their marriage. Has ""till death do us part"" really become cheapened to the point of ""till you lost the winning ticket""? If their marriage means so little to them let them part, let them miss out on the #3m and lose each other into the bargain.      I think it's unfair for a struggling company like Camelot to have to cough up that sort of dough, it's not like they've got money to waste is it? Mind you I bet Richard 'Man of the People' Branson would have paid up.      This has to be the ultimate ""Jobsworth"" attitude. It will make absolutely no difference to Camelot to pay up. It is not in dispute that these people bought the winning ticket so a simple gesture of good faith by the company would go a long, long way to repair their public image as greedy fat cats. The whole country wanted a non-profit People's Lottery not one that stuffed its own pockets, but as we don't have any say in things that directly affect us, this is the least that Camelot could do.      I can't understand why people buy lottery tickets and then forget to check them. Perhaps Camelot ought to stop advertising unclaimed prizes because there is a very good chance that 6 months down the line the ticket will be lost.      It doesn't come much easier. You pick 6 numbers, pay #1, get a ticket, check your numbers and if you have won you are a millionaire. People who cannot master this simple set of tasks do not deserve the money.      Tough Totty! I'm behind Camelot. The whole idea behind tickets is that they are evidence of contract. You lose your ticket, hard cheese. Camelot makes it quite clear that claims need to be made upon the surrendering of tickets within a specified period. The Totts were on TV bleating about how hard done by they are while the woman from Camelot was perfectly reasonable. As for Chris Smith saying Camelot should pay up - that's a cheap price of pre-election propaganda if ever I heard one.     Surely there is a point to having rules and deadlines? They don't just have them for fun!!      No - Camelot do not pay out. It's a very simple rule, buy the ticket, retain it and claim if you win. If you are stupid enough to lose it - tough!!! A softening of this rule would open flood gates of bogus claims and expose Camelot to further criticism, which in the light of their past performances they can do well without.      This case has shown that you must keep tickets in a safe place. If the Totts have lost their ticket - TOUGH! They should be more careful and not to lose things. Get into a routine and place the ticket in a safe place, by the phone, on top of the TV etc. I have won 1x#91 (4 numbers) and 4 or 5 #10 and I always collect my winnings on the Monday if it's a Saturday draw or Thursday if it's a Wednesday draw. The earlier people collect their winnings, the less of the chance they lose the ticket.      If you lose the ticket and don't claim the prize you miss out. Those are the rules which have to be upheld. If they were to relax the them, it would then be entirely reasonable for people who found old tickets (i.e. over the 180 day limit) to expect to be paid even though they had lost any entitlement. It is unfortunate for the couple concerned, but it's not as if they have lost anything - they never had the #3m in the first place. All they have lost is some dreams.      Rules are rules and should be kept by.      I won a tenner a couple of years back, but unfortunately lost the ticket, and was told that I couldn't claim my prize. This was the ruling then, and this must remain the ruling forever. What's good for one is good for everyone else, and if they do hand out the three million, then I also want my ten pound prize from two years ago, and I am sure there will be others demanding the same thing.      I don't feel that Camelot should have to pay up but at the same time they should not be allowed to pocket the money either. The fairest option would be to give the money to charity.      Two weeks ago a cheque appeared through my door. It was from the football pools. I have a standing entry with a direct debit. No paperwork to lose and I don't even have to check the numbers! "
HOC HOC-LH 7.81 " In a sense, we are all clones, i.e., genetic copies of our parents. So all this morality stuff doesn't wash with me. I am rather tired of hearing self-appointed bio-ethicists tell me what is right and wrong.      The genie is out of the bottle. Cloning is going to happen whether we like it or not so we might as well make the best of it.      In my opinion, it's only a question of responsibility. Of course, there's the threat of hi-tech slavery; there are psychological aspects of a child being a copy of a parent. But we got used to in-vitro, so I think we'll get over this one too. All it takes is the responsibility of scientists AND society.      Imagine how that child (cloned) would feel. Imagine knowing you were a complete replica of one of your parents, and that this was deliberate. It would be like not having an identity of your own. There is something very creepy about the thought that parents would want children who are identical to themselves. I have heard that only 1 in 40 will be born without deformity. If this is true, what would happen to the other 39?      Human cloning is the natural next step for biotechnology and it is not necessarily evil. I believe that if it is viable then we should do it. The science of cloning should not be held back by some outdated morals that some people have.      In the event of a breakdown in the parents' marriage, the non-genetic parent may well transfer its antipathy towards the partner onto the child. What will happen to the custody battles? Will the non-genetic partner fight against having custody of a miniature version of the adult they cannot abide? All children need emotional security. Not all get it but the odds are worse for a clone.      I am a research scientist and I am not religious yet I disagree with cloning entire human beings as things stand. The full effects of cloning an entire organism are as yet unknown, and we will have to study the lives of many cloned animals to know the full effects.      The scientific knowledge gained might be useful, but this cannot be done at the risk to a human. I personally (and I am a physicist) would I admit, be curious to know if it worked, but it should not go ahead purely for scientific interest - that would be immoral.      It would be nice if those objecting to human cloning ever explained their objections, beyond superstition about ""playing God"" or primitive expressions of disgust. If prospective parents are so selfishly keen to see their own genes propagated rather than adopting a needy child then they should be allowed their (slim) chance.      Regardless of whether cloning ever becomes workable in practice or ethically acceptable to the public, such cynical attempts to manipulate and exploit the childless for profit should be banned. No doubt none of Dr Antonioni's profits will be put aside to help care for his victims, either child or hopeful parent.      I am a research scientist and find any attempt to stop the progression of science to be unacceptable. Cloning is here to stay, a human is going to be cloned, get used to it. Remember if we let people who do not understand or want to understand science decide our fate the world would still be flat, the sun would still be going around the earth and we would not be advanced as we are today.      I am not surprised that scientists should take the view that the process of cloning should be allowed to develop. Scientists have been able to improve the lives of many human beings. None of the improvements, advances, and breakthroughs would have been possible if the moralists and superstitious had won the various ethical and moral debates.      If scientists wanted to clone me, then why not? The world would be a better place!      I think that cloning is a very bad practice as far as medicine is concerned. Instead let Dr Antonioni invent some kind of vaccine to cure Aids.      I can see nothing wrong with cloning. At present, all concerns expressed by people basically revolve around morality and ethics. They are nothing more than pure speculation. The real impact of cloning on society have yet to be known. So why should cloning be stopped? Besides, cloning can also bring enormous benefits to society. I look forward to the day when we are able to clone our hearts, lungs and kidneys.      For both religious and unreligious people, mankind has a certain limit that cannot be crossed. By crossing it, the world has to wait for the worst from now on. It seems that there is no distinction between what is right and what is wrong any more, and I think we are going to our end of our own free will!      What is happening now was predictable and is the reason why the topic is so controversial. Even though I understand the desire for a baby for childless couples, I tend to think of that doctor as a sorcerer's apprentice. There are so many children waiting to be adopted in the world. I know this is a common argument but shouldn't we try to convince childless couples that this may be a more ethical solution instead of letting them be the guinea pigs of somebody who wants to make his (crazy) dream come true?      The making of Dolly the sheep and Tetra was regarded as one of the greatest achievements in science. Indeed it is. But a human clone in question is a truly serious matter to debate. For parents desperate to get children, Dr. Antonioni would be a godfather. But for a world already full of poverty and disgrace, his idea will bring every kind of troubles.      I find this subject a difficult one to consider. I look from the scientific & medical angle and I see a humanitarian responsibility. Medical research and better treatments are inevitable as we move into the future. However, that is where it should stay. On the moral path I have a bad taste over this one. The reports indicate a much higher percentage of failure than success. Are those people ready to face that? It will turn everything on its head. If this does go ahead then I feel the medical profession is going over board. This can not be allowed to happen, but for pure medical treatment and advancement of that.      Once again mankind has found yet another new, unnatural way to manufacture life. People don't seem to realise the worldwide problems that will be experienced in 10 maybe 20 years time due to soaring numbers in population that will result in food and resource shortages. This may sound heartless, but if you are physically selected by nature not to have children, then you shouldn't. I think more time and money should go into promoting adoption. There are already enough unwanted children out there in desperate need of a loving family environment.     If people want to go ahead with this kind of treatment knowing the risks, then so be it.      I think cloning is wrong. I am not religious but I believe there is something sacred in being an individual which should never be lost. I support DNA modification that would suppress or subdue the unwanted personality traits of humans if possible, such as criminal tendencies. This would benefit the human race in the long run.      I that that cloning should be permitted for the likes of organ transplants or the treatment of disease.      Theoretically, it is not that bad because it would provide a solution to infertility, and, of course, the 'clones' would not actually be that similar to their 'parents' because of environmental differences. However, practically, this could cause major problems because of the danger of errors in cloning, which would be tantamount to manslaughter. More animal research is needed before this sort of action can be justified.      I don't think nature intended everyone to be able to reproduce for population reasons so I don't believe in fertility treatment anyway. But the idea of cloning is disgraceful and makes a mockery of what nature intended.      It is absolutely wrong, the issue is not even debatable.      We have nothing to fear from science, it is materialism that we must reject. To view human life as a means to an end, even a virtuous end like helping couples to have children, is to debase the dignity that the Creator gave us. Most of the world believes in God and a moral law, so how can we continue to fund such inhuman research? I think it is time to rescue science from materialism.      As my daughter-in-law says, cloning is no big deal. She is a clone, and cannot see what all the fuss is about. She is a clone? Yes, she is an identical twin. She has the same genetic makeup as her sister, right down to their fingerprints.      For the doctors to stupidly think that cloning is not a two-edged sword is immature and irresponsible. They should know better than anyone what happens when human evolution reaches its pinnacle. I just hope that mankind doesn't have to suffer the sins of these people.      How would Dr Jon Mabley, USA, feel if he were told that only artists could comment on art, soldiers on war and chefs on food? We may not be scientists but we have to live in the world that they create and we have every right to object to what these arrogant people are doing.      I don't think infertility treatment is really an issue is it? Cloning is much more expensive and less reliable even than IVF. Clearly this is simply a race to be 'first'.      A few people want millions of pounds to clone children. Millions of people want a few pounds to prevent their children starving. "
HOC HOC-LZ 7.69 " I'm 17 years of age and I'm sure this would make me a young person but I feel it's a gross stereotype to say that ""young people prefer sex to romance"". I'm an Evangelical Christian and seeing as I'm not married, when it comes to a choice of chocolates or sex, it's chocolates every time. Maybe if sex wasn't encouraged in Social Education for four years flat, others wouldn't be so inclined to go for the 'fun' option.      Eventually, we all develop an overwhelming passion for that special someone ... whether we find it reciprocated or live in frustration, the power of love and courtship (with or without intimate relations) is a basic human emotion. Asking if ""love"" is dead is rather akin to asking if life over. We are a species of passions ... it's what makes us tick.      Romance does exist although its hard to find among today's sexually charged society. To many people sex comes before love and we have a scenario where people cheat easily and change partners like used cars. Its hard to find real romance in a world where many people will perform the closest aspects of a relationship with someone they met half a hour ago.      Sex is nice, but it takes a lot more effort and emotional honesty to do something romantic or affectionate, Valentines Day or no Valentines Day      The whole argument seems to be flawed, because sex (remember the phrase ""making love""?) can be the most romantic expression of a persons love and closeness for another if done right - why can't we have both?      The only thing that bothers me is that so many people seem to see sex as unromantic compared to chocolates, flowers etc.      I cannot help but feel that skipping the valuable courtship phase has major social and personal ramifications. Many a long lasting love affair has started out with a deep and enduring friendship. Wasn't the 1940's, Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, film just voted the most romantic movie, well ahead of the steamy Titanic love affair? Proving that many other people feel the same.      Romance can happen on any day of the year. Why do two people need to manufacture it on a holiday invented by other people?      Just get the women a new washing up set, or a frying pan and it keeps them happy while you score on the brownie points! Also a bunch of plastic roses is a must in emergencies, because like the plastic flowers your love will never die!!!!      I am in my 40s and a lady in her 20s asked me for a date. I arrived with flowers, opened the car door for her, pulled out her seat in the restaurant, put my coat around her when she was chilly, etc. At the end of the night she said, ""I suppose you want your sex now for being so nice to me all night"". She couldn't believe it when I explained that in my twenties I had always behaved in this way and NO I did not expect sex. She was absolutely flabbergasted. Romance IS dead and wasted on youth.      Mankind is becoming increasingly practical. What's the point of wasting time on courting and purchasing chocolate, when you're going to end up having sex anyhow?      Valentine's Day is like a Road Chef on the Highway of Love. It's a place where you could stop and buy a tasteless but expensive meal or you could take this opportunity to just park up with the one you Love and appreciate the journey you've made together. It sounds to me like a lot of the romantically uninclined cynics above would drive straight past. My advice to them is to slow down and take a look around; romance isn't dead at all.      Not at all, why just today I wooed a woman with a red rose and she was overjoyed. I think there's still a place for old-fashioned, Clark Gable-style romance.      To say romance is dead suggests that it was alive in the first place, it isn't, it's just an illusion, smoke and mirrors driven by the human instinct to procreate, yet cloaked in a ridiculous ritual because we want to have sex.      So the young people of today would prefer sex to a box of chocolates? So would I, and I'm 65! (Lucky if I get a peck on the cheek these days)      Goodness there are some real killjoys about. Maybe we all are too cynical and yes, Valentines Day has become an enormous rip-off, but some of the most beautiful music and stories were written in the name of love; vive la difference; vive l'amour.      I have to disagree with Eva W. I think we are hung up about sex in the UK. The Netherlands has the most enlightened attitude in the world, and probably the lowest rate of teenage pregnancies. Sadly, I fear that the Dutch may be so sophisticated about the mechanics of sex, they may have missed the point about romance along the way.      Chocolates? Flowers? An expensive meal for two? It's all prostitution in the end.      We have to accept the Freudian philosophy that all actions are sexually motivated. Sex is good but sex coupled with romance is sensational.      I told my boyfriend not to bother with flowers and expensive gifts because the prices at this time of year are ridiculous! But then I did wake up to breakfast in bed with a single red rose! - Far cheaper and more effective! Roll on romance, it's nice to be spoilt any day of the year!      I feel sorry for people who have forgotten or have never learned that a little pampering and appreciation can make a long winter a little warmer.      Romance and courtship is the nice name humans put on Mating, and why not? We do need to take time out and appreciate the ones we hold dear. You certainly don't need over priced roses to do that! Long Live Love!      I must point out that the forms or interviewers probably only gave the unfortunate victims of this survey a choice of Chocolate OR sex. Romance is not dead, it's just shunned by today's society because it's a vunerability. Romance leaves you open to a broken heart and that's the last thing anyone wants in our almost Darwinistic society.      Romance may not be dead, but it's certainly gasping for air. Do we REALLY need to save up and wait for Feb. 14 to prove how much our loved ones mean to us? When it's expected and planned, there's no thrill, no rush, no giggling excitement. Romance is meant to be spontaneous, mad, and impetuous. Why have a huge blow-out on Feb. 14? A bigger surprise is getting one perfect rose on Jan. 18. The set-up and expectation for Feb. 14 is sitcom fodder.      So many cynics here! Romance will never fade... end of story!      Who said romance is dead...the media? We all express romance differently and under subject to different stimulus. To some it is through chocolates, champagne and flowers, to others, via something else...it's very easy to judge one another and blame ""greedy merchants"" but romance is a personal emotion, and one that is constantly being measured and put into a box by us all. Live and let live.      Feminism killed romance!      If romance is dead, then the media do not help with their dribbling, sensationalist obsession with sex. We are the only animals who make truly loving gestures to one another and it should be celebrated and done all year round, not just on one day whose now sole purpose is to help company balance sheets. And this is speaking as a non-embittered singleton.      I feel tremendous pity for those poor souls who can't enjoy the day for what it is. It's a special day to show your deep love and desire towards another individual. Most of the doubters will have sad lonely lives. It's your loss?.      Most correspondents sound like they are in need of sex AND love very badly.      Stop moaning, it would be nice just to get something. Valentine's Day is there to make single people feel miserable and unloved      I don't think romance is dead, just don't see the point in having society dictate to me that today I must pay over the odds to shower my fianc?e with gifts. If my other half brought me presents on Valentine's Day I would be upset, he wouldn't be buying them because he loved me but because he ""has"" to as dictated by society. We can be romantic to each other any time of the year, not just this one particular day.      Surely romance should be about spontaneity and surprise, and I can't think of anything less spontaneous than Valentine's Day! Romance should be all year round, not just one day.      A single long stemmed rose, candlelit dinner for two prepared by me, champagne, strawberries and chocolates for dessert. If that isn't romantic then I don't know what is. By the way I am not old (28) and I am married, but I still did this before I was not married. I guess that's what romance is about, being prepared to do that sort of thing for someone. Sex is all very well (and very nice too) but there is more to love than that.      Romance is alive and well and in the most unexpected of places. My boyfriend is a geordie which some people might think means my chances of romance are pretty slim. It couldn't be more opposite. I've had two cards from him already today, and I am being taken out for a meal at a mystery location tonight. I'm feeling like a very lucky lady!      I always thought that the desire for sex was the reason for romance and courting. If you could get the former without the latter then I bet no one would ever spend the time and effort on romance.      Britain is a decidedly non-romantic country where young people grow up very enlightened about sex but completely ignorant of courtship and the joy of anticipation. It is a cultural thing and, sadly, nothing much can be done about it with attitudes repeating themselves down the generation line. This is not to say that Valentine's day is anything to do with romance. It is a commercial rip-off and very shallow.      Romance is dead in our bleak, cynical world of personal success and status driven robots. Valentines Day is merely an excuse to go and spend more of our money, eat more and drink more. I am thinking of living in the countryside and going for long walks.      No, but all too easily forgotten amidst the continuous time pressures of an instant gratification society! As with anything, it pays to make an effort and will be rewarded in kind...      Romance is not dead, it's just that those who can think for themselves increasingly resent being expected to pay an exorbitant premium for roses and dinner out. I refuse to pay #50+ for a dozen roses, or to be half of many couples lining a faceless restaurant with as many tacky ""table for 2""'s crammed in as possible while service is slow and prices are high.      My boyfriend is working in USA, I thought I will go to visit him for a week, and during valentine's day, got the money, got the ticket, went to the embassy, and they refused to give me a short stay visa, saying that we are not sure you'll come back! What a great romantic day!      70-80% of teenagers are sexually active! I should be so lucky and I'm a foxy young woman in my prime at 23 years who would quite happily push aside romance for a night of hot, steamy passion!      What rot. People of all ages have been having sex since we evolved. We haven't thought up something new, you know! Romance is something you only get when you love and are loved. A card to a stranger isn't romantic, it just shows you're interested!      This is my plan for Valentines...a curry and bucket-loads of lager, followed by a session of drunken, incompetent sex. Who said romance is dead?      I dislike these artificially-hyped 'special days', Valentine's, Mother's Day, even Christmas now - all are a means to get us to spend money. Real romance will never die. My partner and I fell in love three years ago in our 60s and we're still as committed to each other and as passionately-loving. We don't need the marriage certificate to prove our commitment. We each wear a ring for each other and we made our vows in private. Romance is someone who phones me at work and says 'are you having a good day?', or kisses me good night and tucks me up when I'm asleep and he comes in from his late shift. Romance is someone to go on holiday with and share memorable experiences, to share your life with and be warm and caring...I could go on, but you get the picture!      Romance is only dead if your version of it consists of an annual dousing of a dozen red roses, a bottle of bubbly and some chocs. Romance quantified, wrapped and sold - yuk!      At what point in history would young people have rather received chocolates and red roses to having sex? The Victorian Era perhaps? The desire to procreate will always be the first desire and a good job too as I wouldn't be sitting here writing this and you wouldn't be there reading it.      I have just had a reaction to a card I send. It said, I am not a romantic, i am a solist. Romance is so dead, bleh.      The same people that killed Christmas have killed romance with their cheesy pre-packaged commercial manipulation of emotions. That said the day is just another piece of crass superstition anyway.      In today's hectic world of both partners working hard at careers, good sex is rare due to stress. So more effort and thought goes into making sex successful than in 'secondary' gifts. For instance, what is the meaning of a box of chocolates in a sexless relationship? Are both partners reconciled to getting no nookie? Unfortunately there is little time for romance these days!      Yes I think Valentine's Day is dead and so it should be. However romance is very much alive and kicking! I make sure I show my girlfriend how much I care all year round and not just one day a year! Valentine's Day is hyped by people selling cards, chocolates and flowers at over-inflated prices. No wonder young people would rather have sex! It's much cheaper.      Maybe the rituals have changed. Maybe there is now more open acceptance of sexuality in our societies. Maybe the level of commitment expected before sexual intercourse takes place has diminished. But courtship rituals have always been about sex. A box of chocolates or a bunch of roses has never been an end in itself.      Is sex what they want, or is it that the media has made them think that they should want it? Nowadays children feel pressurised by both the media and their peers into sexual relations before they are ready.      Last night it was flowers and a meal out. This morning, card, chocolates and breakfast in bed while I did the washing up. Sex? No thanks. Not with my rotten cold and stinking headache (and the kids running around), but seeing her happy made all the difference to me.      Romance isn't dead, it's just got fed up with rip-off Britain. The boyfriend might not be able to afford #60 for a dozen red roses, and even if he could, many girls I know would feel guilty about such an extravagant present.      You don't have to fork money out to be romantic. Homemade cards and gifts take much more creativity and show that the recipient is unique. Why do I need a card with a cheesy poem in it when I can write my own especially for my loved one?      Romance is not dead, although Valentine's Day is over-commercialised. Last year, a dozen red roses cost me #48, this year they cost #70 - an absolutely ludicrous amount to pay for some flowers! Nonetheless, the effect they have on my other half is priceless. Although next year I'll be contemplating growing my own...      Hands up anyone who is surprised! In a society that no longer attaches any particular stigma to sex, or even encourages it, how many people would choose never to have sex and instead have a box of chocolates and some flowers? If WE think that way, why on earth should we expect our kids to? And if we educate them sensibly so they at least understand contraception, what harm can it do?      It is hardly surprising that young people are more interested in sex than romance given the amount of sexual imagery they are subjected to every day in the media. In films and on television sex is all too often portrayed as the starting point of a relationship rather than what it should be, the culmination of a gradual process of getting to know one another.      Perhaps it is because the traditional Valentine has been commercialised too much. I was charged #50 to have a dozen roses sent to my loved one at work!! Anyone who has grown their own roses can only balk at that. Instead I went to my supermarket, bought flowers my girl likes, a Dido CD, a bottle of Cava and it was still cheaper than flower delivery and more importantly is what she wants. My point is perhaps the young realise that sex is better than getting ripped off by these greedy merchants!!!!!      Romance is never dead in people with loving hearts. The commercialism of Valentine's Day has nothing to do with romance. As for preferring sex to flowers or chocolates, or vice versa, who cares? If sex is what makes two people deliriously happy, then that's what they should give one another. On the other hand, some people enjoy the giving and receiving of little gifts or treats more exciting. After all, you may be having sex every day, but how often do you get breakfast in bed?      Romance isn't dead, it's just becoming more personal to the individual.      I refuse to pay rip-off prices for mass-produced ""gifts"". Last night my wife, knowing I am utterly cynical about marketing, was expecting an evening in with a jacket potato for dinner. Instead I bought some food, cooked her dinner (her favourite) and a bottle of pink champagne. It meant more to her than any mass-produced gift ever could. True romance will never die, but the chain stores are trying hard to bottle it. "
JOC JOC-12B-04N 9.2 "I think that EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. It is too early. It is the truth that EU was established for keeping out any wars and this purpose has been fulfilled for 60 years. However we must not forget that EU also holds some countries which suffer for the financial crisis. In fact, we can see a lot of demonstrators in these countries. EU should strive to solve this issue before being awarded the Prize, or peace in EU will not be kept for a long time.  I think the award is just joke because EU caused depressions from Greece and it leads the world to bad world. I think America and Japan also keep the peace. I agree eurosceptics.  I disagree with the Nobel peace prize's winner of this year. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be admitted to be peaceful by people all over the world. But this case, people even in the EU criticizes about the prize, such as eurosceptics. Moreover the word of ""peace"" ought to have the only one meaning, so I believe these wide way of thinking about recipient is wrong.  I think Nobel Prize should be sent to individuals rather than organization. Sometimes many people contribute to common feat together and it's hard to decide who is the best and deserved. As a result, an organization not an individual is awarded. But this decision may not do good to both those who were involved in the feat and the idea of Nobel Prize itself. Firstly, individuals' achievements were hidden by too broad and vague achievement of an organization. For instance, EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace is made up of many individuals' achievements such as breaking the dictatorship. Even if EU awards the Nobel Prize, they cannot attract people's attention. Their feats may not be revealed to people in the world. On the contrary, If a individual awards the Nobel Prize, at least one of their achievements is in the spotlight. Secondary, some organizations utilize Nobel Prize as a propaganda to boost their confidence. Policy of a country is one of the most polarizing issues and many people may not agree to the award. In reality, some praise the EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace while other criticize it even in the member of the EU. And in such a situation, the organizations are only self-satisfied with the award. So I believe Nobel Prize should go to only individuals.  Like other people said, I think EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. They were given the prize because they had no war for 60 years, but I think there are other countries where they don't have war for longer than 60 years. Also, like some people mentioned, EU is the one who lead Economic Crisis. There were lot of demos toward government. I'm not so sure that leading Economic Crisis and Demos are ""Peace. "" Also, some people said that Prize should be given to independent, but I think organization also have right to earn the Prize.  I don't think EU deserves Nobel Peace Prize. Though it's admirable that EU had no war for 60 years, we should not say that only such a thing is required for Peace. Because of the recent world wide depression, many people and countries are suffering from financial problem. European countries are some of the most struggling countries in the world. Due to this problem, it's easily assumable that people are loosing their jobs. How can we call that such countries peaceful? I agree with ID12063's comment. I do not think that EU deserves the prize. The prize was given because European countries had no war for 60 years, but I think it is strange because we must not cause a war any more. Therefore, it does not matter whether 60 years have passed. We do not care about that how many years we live without war. We just need to think about not causing a war again.  I don't think that EU deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize because 60 years of peace in Europe is not special. WWII damaged Europe seriously. Therefore EU didn't have plenty of energy left over for starting new war.  As other people had said, I don't think EU suits to Nobel Peace Prize. Keeping out war is a thing that must be done everywhere around the world and it is not a special thing. There are still many problems are happening in Europe countries and they have to correspond to these problems.  I think this is not worthy to recognize. I agree the Nobel Peace Prize only go to individuals. This recognition look like a performance of politics. And, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should only go to individuals because the Nobel Peace Prize go to a person who contributes to the peace of the world. If the frame of government receive the prize, this means criticizing the others. And, this will connect a thought which winner is always right.  Shameful talk, I didn't know that EU have won the Nobel Peace Prize. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should not only go to individuals but also to organization and so on, because Peace can be protected by everyone. So it's difficult to won the Nobel Peace Prize, but I want to do something for world peace.  Some critics say the reason why EU got the award of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize is that it will encourage European countries to tackle with the difficulties they are facing now, such as economic crisis. There's no denying that it is a good thing to encourage individuals or organizations to strive hard, but is there any justification for the Nobel Peace Prize to do so? I don't think so. Nobel Peace Prize should be separate from the political or economical matter happening in the country or in the world. They should focus only on whether the deed of the actor is appropriate for being commended. Using this argument, I also disagree with when President Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize in the matter of contribution to the peace of Afghanistan. He hasn't really done anything to the peace of Afghanistan ( some say he made Afghanistan more dangerous place) and at this time the prize was awarded just as an encouragement as well. So what I would like to say is that I certainly agree with the fact that some EU countries have contributed to settle down some of the conflicts they had, it was just an outcome of the history, and there's no justification and it is unfair for EU to achieve the prize because while individual or NGO activists routinely make sacrifices and take huge risks to do make the peaceful world, EU are paid to do so.  I am not an European, but Japanese, therefore I do not understand what affairs EU is now confronted with, and what it has really brought Europe. I have so poor knowledge that I am not able to express my opinion about this issue. I have to learn more about it. Anyway I do not care whether Nobel Peace Prize should go to such institutions as EU, or individuals. As Mario Monti says, the prize, I hope, will encourage EU to overcome the current economic difficulties.  I like EU, so I was happy when I was heard the news EU got the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, I can understand some critics against this incident, but you can't deny the role of EU for peace in Europe. The cooperation between many countries, as EU has done, is very important for achieving the international peace, I think. What EU did is precious the ""history"". We have to learn them, both good things and bad things.  In the first place, the Nobel Prize is awarded to the best of contributor in the each field. In other words, this prize is awarded to the person. Nobel  thought that this prize should be awarded regardless of countries and nations. But is this winning prize against Nobel's will? So I think that the Nobel Prize is awarded to the person not to the organization. Furthermore, I have some doubts about this winning the prize. One of the doubts is the reason why EU is awarded the Nobel Prize. The reason why the EU is awarded is that, as the article written, the EU in recognition of 60 years without war and for encouraging EU governments and people to press forward, ""overcoming the current economic difficulties. "" But it is strange. Firstly, most of democratic countries haven't made wars since WWII. EU side will talk about the relationship between France and Germany especially. But there were tense situation between countries such as Japan and China. Both countries also haven't gone to war. Secondly, winning the prize is strange for only overcoming the economic crisis. First of all, economy is not related to the Piece. And also there were a lot of countries which are facing the crisis. This award is against Nobel's will that should not support a part of countries. For these reasons I disagree with this award.  I don't think that EU deserved Nobel Peace Prize. The reason of that is, no matter what people say, the present economic depressions. And I think EU's idea of integration is great, of course, but I don't think just the idea have worth of the prize. Not only that, this reception would let the value of the prize down and make me think that it is a desperate election. Sometimes, there were the years of no recipient of the prize. Causing these problems, I think not electing was better than electing forcibly.  I agree that the EU was given the nobel prize. It is because there are still some wars all over the world, these days the number of the wars have been reducing, though. Many classmates disagree with this news, but I do not think so. Anything that keep a peace should be praised. I believe that the peace of the whole world is the most important thing that every people should hope. In short, the nobel  organization should give the nobel peace prize to a lot of plans, organizations, and association.  I disagree with the nobel peace prize of this year. Surely it is wonderful to keep being without war for 60 years. However it is a part of the EU. The EU also have bad aspects, for example economic crisis. Moreover the nobel prize should be given to only individuals, because prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics.  I do not disagree with the fact that EU has awarded the Nobel peace prize of 2012. Some says it is not appropriate to give such a prize to the organization, but why? I think there is no doubt that the EU has contributed to keep the peace of the European continent. Think about the past! There had been wars in every generations! But, now? no more war. Is there any doubt that it has not contributed to achieve such a great thing? I agree with the nobel peace prize for EU. I think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize. EU accomplish its purpose properly. I expect that this prize will make a sense of unity stronger, and function to improve the economic crises.  I think this collision is being come by the absence of standard of prizing Nobel Peace Prize. Actually, it is hard to establish a standard of Peace Prize. Because Peace can be thought as both comprehensive and microscopic. However, in my personal opinion, I think the Nobel Peace Prize have to be prized by a standard based on microscopic viewpoint. Nobody would be awarded if presenting the Peace Prize based on comprehensive since there are no people who had not made a fault in their lives. Therefore, EU deserved to prize the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think Nobel Peace Prize is given the man who proposed and caught out the idea which has a possibility to make everyone happy. Its aim isn't for everyone, the importance is to make many people happy, and need not any sacrifices. Now, EU can't resolve the problem of poverty, the society which can make a part of people happy is not really happy I think.  I do not think the EU deserves the nobel prize as many students complaining above. They said that the EU was kept without war for 60 years. This should be appreciated, but they caused terrible problem at the same time. The depression we are struggling with now is actually caused from one of the countries of the EU. To receive the prize, they should have solved the problem and been perfect.  I can't understand why EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think that EU contributed peace of world. On the contrary, EU confused the world economy by financial crisis. But, I agree organization are awarded Nobel Prize. Because, I think many kind of method for peace have to be evaluated.  I think it is unconvinced that EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think EU didn't contribute peace of world entirely, but it is abstract and i don't understand how EU contribute.  I think it is important to cooperate with other people to tackle some problems. But once the group became powerful, people in it apt to think their own profit. I don't think that is just. We should be careful not being so.  No war for 60 years in Europe is valuable. But I don't know this is worth awarding as a Nobel Peace Prize. That because I can't understand the criterion of awarding . I think some people are worth awarding it, but others which I didn't think they had done enough services award it. So I think the value of the Nobel Peace Prize is getting less.  As many eurosceptics said, this nobel peace prize for EU may exaggerate it's achievements. If the prize winner was an individual, we could see a consistent policy or so. But a big organization as EU, people can't be sure which to focus on it's accomplishments. The Nobel  committee should show more concrete reason for people assent for it.  many people disagrees about eu winning the nobel peace prize, but i think they should deserve one. as ID12048 said, no war for 60 years in eu is valuable thing so other countries should follow eu's example.  No war for 60 years is good. But, I felt strange that EU got a Nobel peace prize because, EU is not only a country that without war for 60 years. It not fair.  I think EU should not win the nobel peace prize because they are not ready enough. I think that the nobel peace prize should be given to the person who has completed it work which had made a good effect for world peace. These days, I think standard of the nobel prize is blurring. As I said, it should be given to the person who has completed the work. Not ti the person who has only started, like president Obama and Grameen Bank. I feel it is sad that the nobel prize is becoming something that doesn't mean anything.  I think EU don't deserve Nobel Peace Prize . It is not appropriate reason that EU recognition of 60 years with out war.  Like most students have written in their comments, I do not think it is appropriate for the EU to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, there is a fact that the economic crisis which the world is still suffering from was caused by one of the EU country. Also, I am not persuaded by the idea that they received the prize in recognition of 60 years without war. It is not quite fair for other countries which have kept their peace for more than 60 years and have caused any problems like the world depression.  I think the award of EU is not strange. I would like to show two the reason. First, there have been no war theses 60 years in EU, it is worth to being praised. I studied the world history in high school, so I can understand the difficulty to keep piece there. The history of Europe is the history of wars. So, when I think the fact, This situation without wars for 60 years is wonderful. Secondly, this prize implies to expect EU to fight this danger situation of EU. Now, EU has big financial problem with Greece. I think this Nobel Prize means that cheering EU to get over it.  I do not think it amusing that EU wins a Nobel Peace Prize . Because, EU is no-war for 60 years. Moreover, by having won the nobel peace prize, it is thought that the consciousness of the peace of EU will become strong from now on. Therefore, this award is good.  I think the award of EU is natural. the fact that there have been no war in 60 years is so admirable. Were it not for EU, big war among countries would've fired, I guess. so it's worth to be praised.  Once European countries had made war. But EU aimed stabilization of economy and developed a sense of camaraderie, and as a result, no war is going on in Europe. This is great thing, I think. Thinking of Asian countries' confrontation - such as China, North Korea, and Japan-EU's grappling is meaningful. However, not existence of war was brought not only by positive actions for peace but also by the natural course.  Congratulations EU! I think it is good thing that EU got nobel prize. Though EU have tremendous problems, EU have great meaning for future. Europe is mature place. So Europe must take point. Europe is in depression because of financial difficulties of Greece and Portugal. I think EU can great job.  I am for the eurosceptics. I think that EU took an important role in postwar confusion. But it should not be praised now. EU now has many problems such as economic difficulties, and it doesn't seem to have brought a peace to the world. So the award isn't deserved. Possibly the prize will encourage european people to press forward and solve the current problems. But it has nothing to do with the world peace too much. Important thing is what EU did, not what EU will do. Many people misunderstand the meaning of Nobel Peace prize.  In recent years, Nobel Peace Prize tends to be awarded as a hope to the winner's success of its future (for example, Obama was awarded shortly after he was inaugurated as President). Maybe it's the same thing this time. So I think it is not something to get angry.  I agree with ID12054 comment. I think EU doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. Because 60 years without war is a good point but, some countries in the EU have continued economic recession. There are a lot of unemployed. EU does not deserve the prize in economic . Too early to get a prize.  I disagree to the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, the EU's recognition of 60 years without war is really good, I think. But they forget the Cold War. After WW2, they struggled for their profits and many countries are suffered from WW2 and the Cold War. So, I think the EU should not won the Nobel Peaze Prize.  I think it is inappropriately that EU win Nobel Prize. Certainly no war has happened since 60 years ago, there is many problem now, so there is possibility the safety of EU become worse. Nobel Prize shouldn't be given EU, should be given individual who tried for EU peace.  I think the EU does not deserve the Nobel peace prize. It is true that countries in the EU strive to unify Europe to create a peaceful civil society and work together as a political experiment to become an example for settling peace in their countries; however, this cannot be a reason for Nobel peace prize. There are two reasons for this idea. Firstly, Alfred Nobel's will specified that the prize should be given to ""the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. "" But it is hard to say EU has promoted peace in other countries. Fundamentally, EU is an organization for the welfare of the people who are members of EU countries. It is true that European countries are at peace because of EU. But even though unification decreased war in Europe and made peace in the European area, EU eventually turned into a hegemony. For example, EU disregarded the demands of help from Burmese pro-democracy activists many times. They requested help from the EU because dictatorship in Burma was worsening and international society did not see the gravity of the situation even though a lot of Burmese citizens were killed or sent to prison. But EU also disregarded that problem. Also, EU is responsible for destroying the Bamyan Buddha. In 2003, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha, with the intention of appealing to international society to accept their political will and wish to negotiate with EU and UN to approve Taliban as pre-government of Afghanistan. Of course, Taliban cannot become the government of Afghanistan, and because EU and UN did not talk with them, they finally destroyed Bamyan Buddha which is precious human cultural asset. The EU and UN had to negotiate with them even though the Taliban was not recognized as the official government because they already ruled most of Afghanistan and the EU and UN needed to create a solution to protect the people of Afghanistan and the Bamyan Buddha. Secondly, the idea that EU contributed to the decline of war is wrong. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1990 to 2004, only 4 wars occurred between countries. Aside from country-to-country war, almost every other war was civil war. The decline of war is due to the flow of international politics, not because of the EU.  When I first heard that the EU have earned a nobel peace prize, I was really surprised. The reason is that the EU has played an important role during the war and also did good job to end it. However, now, the EU is having a lot of problems in economies, relationships, and so on. It is true that countries in the EU tried to unify and made some effort to do good politics. However when we think about whether EU has promoted ""Peace"" to the other countries, I can't help saying no to this question. The nobel peace prize should be given to the one who strived to promote peace all other the world. In this meaning, I don't think that the EU is appropriate for the prize to be given.  Since I had thought that Nobel Prize is to be given to individuals, so this news surprised me, but I think EU deserves that Prize. This is because It is true that there have been no war in Europe for over a half-century, and Nobel Peace Prize have been given to non-individuals several times.  I think the EU should not be awarded the Nobel Prize. EU scale is too large. EU does not bring economic development. Gap in Europe is larger. When the EU was able to redress the economic disparity, I admit their Nobel Prize.  Certainly the European Union is trying to change Europe and the world in a peaceful way, the way to understand this isn't only one, the news showed. EU hasn't achieved the real peace yet because each country doesn't turn them face toward the same direction.  I agree with the award because EU prevent a big war between countries in Europe. However, if one country has economic crisis, a lot of country will be influenced. This is a defect about Eu. As many people know, Greece has had economic crisis and country around Greece were damaged too.  We can imagine but we don't or will never know how the world without EU would go on and what would happen there. So I cannot know what eurosceptics say. They should recognize the value of the presence and contribution toward peace of EU.  I think Nobel peace prize in the wonderful award in the world. Also EU has a right to get this award because they control European countries peacefully. This is not easy thing to do. Still now, many wars are happening around the world and many people died because of wars which make no sense. From this news, I hope people should notice about how wonderful peace is and try to make world better than now.  It is pleasing that EU received Nobel  peace prize. However, EU has a lot of problems which have to be solved immediately. For example, it is financial crisis. Once it occur in any country in EU, it spread all over EU countries. We have to think of the both advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the Nobel Peace Prize must not be given as a joke. I believe that before giving the prize, many people think carefully and judge that it is suitable for EU. Certainly America and Japan keep the peace, but the case of EU, there are many countries. It is not just the matter between two countries. I think this prize is suitable for EU.  I strongly disagree with ID12017 from ""EU Nobel Peace Prize earns praise and ridicule"" I think it's wrong that EU had received Nobel prize because it's something natural try not to have a war between countries. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be given to individuals who did great effort to not only to prevent the war, but something more.  I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is true that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe. For example, Europe considers itself the cradle of human rights and democracy, has called for protection of human rights to other countries but if you wear a covering Burka called European Muslims will be fined penalties. Construction of a mosque with a minaret not allowed in countries such as Switzerland. Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored.  i think the reason of EU got the Nobel Peace prize is not appropriate.  He think it is okay that Nobel Peace Prize is given non-individuals several times. I think so too, but EU is not appropriate ""several times"". EU has many problems, so I can't overlook them.  This comment says this Nobel Peace Prize is Joke. Certainly, he could thought at first it is strange to award EU which has a seriously financial problem now. However, I believe this Nobel Prize has an important mean that they want EU to deal with the terrible situation, expecting the future. I wrote detailed it the box ""Lesson review"". This comment don't understand it. So, I strongly disagree with.  The word 'Peace' have to be thought as pluralistic. In other words, peace can be a real peace to some people, but not to other people. For example, one country could think that they had kept the peace by fighting against to other country. However, citizens, or countries which gave and received damage can think that it's not a peace but just a unhappiness.  I agree in EU awarding a prize of the Nobel Prize. This is because EU continued keeping European peace and prosperity for 60 years. I think that the new war does not happen in Europe, and the peace is keeping. Therefore this news is a very happy thing.  I also think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize, but individual should be respect, i think. so i strongly disagreed with this comment.  I agree with this opinion because Nobel Prize is for the people who distribute the peace of the world, not peace specific area indeed. As I commented before, it is difficult to treat EU distributed peaceful of Europe area. Europe area could stay peaceful in past decades because tendency of world politics going toward decrease of wars, not because effort of EU countries resulted. Also, same as written in this comment, there is a people who criticize EU Nobel Prize as EU point out as a reason why the economic crisis occurred recently accelerated.  As I wrote the comment in this article, I strongly believe that individuals have to be won the Nobel Prize not company or organization.  I can't agree with Europe receiving Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, 60 years without wars is very important thing. But there are many countries without wars more than 60 years. And regarding economic, Europe has crimes as much as wars. Europe leads world to bad situation. Europe must have responsible about that.  In addition to praise the recipient's activity, the aim of Nobel Prize is to promote the act of recipient . I think this Nobel Peace Prize is thought a little differently from other Nobel Prize. This Prize for EU means that many people wants EU to unite more strongly. EU was founded after reflection of two World War and Cold War. Although more tighter connection was expected, it is hard to say this dream has come true. EU has lots of problems to solute, for example, European economic crisis. Each country has different opinions and some participating nation doubt about EU itself. In this situation, this award is thought to be a message from the world that cheer EU up.  The prize praised, at the same time critics attacked it as a misplaced. I think that this critics reaction was right action. I can't agree with EU Nobel Peace Prize. After all, I didn't understand the meaning and the contents of this prize.  Originally, my opinion to this article is different from his, however, his opinion is so logical and after reading his comment, I became in favor of it.  I strongly disagree with this idea because EU hasn't promoted ""Peace"". This is the most important reason to be given a Nobel Peace Prize and EU hasn't done it. Don't have any reason to be deserved to given a prize I agree with the award of 2012 Nobel Peace Prize to the EU in recognition of 60 years without war. Surely, because of the recent world depression, many people and countries in Europe were suffered from financial problem. Especially, Spain and Greece are the most struggling countries in the world and still suffered from the problem. But, I think that the award gave the EU a new responsibility to create more united, more just and stronger peace. For that, the cooperation of the EU is more and more essential. I hope that the European Union keep unifying for peace forever.  I think that the EU deserves to win the Nobel Prize. It is very difficult to cooperate with other countries about economic, security, diplomacy and the judiciary and try to do that. Surely their aim has not achieved yet. But, I think that the attempt which you never have seen deserve the award.  I think what is related to politics such as EU and the prime minister should not be awarded. In Japan, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was awarded, but a secret understanding problem became appeared later. I don't think that any politician contribute the world peace without political intention. That's why I give a thought to what is concerned with politics should not be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Because she think about this news same as my opinion. And she suggested ""wide way of thinking"", I think this opinion is very wonderful, and I think that I want to be a person able to have the way of thinking like her.  I disagree with this comment because it focuses on a point alone. To be sure, Greece and EU influenced the world's economic for negative, however, this alone can't explain it's unsuitability for the prise. Those awarded the Nobel  Prizes  have had faults many or few. The same thing can be said to this case. Of course EU has effects that can't be praised , on the contrary, they surely contribute to peace for its members. We should see things inclusively.  I don't agree eurosceptics' opinions. The EU hasn't done anything yet, but I think the prize can put pressure on the EU's future efforts. To overcome today's aspect, the prize was necessary.  I think it is good for EU to receive the Nobel Prize. The Prize makes EU think that they should cooperate with each other stronger. This effect is good for the World Peace.  I disagree with this opinion. I think EU isn't entitled to Nobel Peace Prize and there are no wars in Japan, too. I think there are many people who are more entitled this prize in the world.  This news is very nice. But, I can't understand EU contributes to world peace. Certainly, it is very important there has been no wars in EU for 60 years. Nowadays, there are very few wars of between countries in the world.  Everyone probably thought the same thing but I also think that the EU are worthy of the nobel prize as theres nothing special to it. They should not be any war in the first place.  In my opinion, EU Nobel Peace Prize is valuable to prosper countries and enhance connection between EU nations. Reward is happy to everyone. I hope cloth countries cooperate with each other and raise more able for award. "
JOC JOC-13A-01N 8.56 "Reading this article made me really ashamed because I didn't tried to learn how people damaged by the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan after hearing the news. Also I didn't even pay attention to the car bomb in Iraq. Of course the terrorist attack in Boston was a serious incident and it was natural that media all over the world focused on it. However, the value of people's lives must be equal regardless of economic influence of their countries. We should remember that the press do not necessarily report all the news equally, and should attempt to learn what happen in the world by ourselves.  I was shocked by this news. I think , actually, there're gap in news. Relatively, Europe and US news are picked up largely. That's because, I think, US and European country such as France, Britain have authority all over the world.  I have received unquestioningly the news given. Therefore, this article get me thinking. If the value of life was estimated unequal, that may be problem. But, I also think that it is natural the mass media take priority to report their own country and related country.  I got a feeling of wrongness. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorisms must be perished from the world. But there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily. So the mass medias should spread the world's journalism to make our knowledge wider.  I didn't know the bomb accident in Iraq so far. I'm sure it is caused by the media. We always receive a lot of informations all over the world through the media. It is natural that the media tends to pick up the article which has great impact. But we should try to know more aggressive. To accomplish it, quit depending on the media.  I don't think that world's media which failed to report a case of Iran and Pakistan consider American lives to be more important than that of the people who live in developing countries. The reason is that the people who report news as business have to announce the matter which citizens are interested in. The cause is attitude of recipients of news. With this article, I realize own narrow field of vision, so I want to have a wide one. And then, I hope to end the vicious cycle : our indifference bring upon a gap in news coverage and we don't have much interests in developing countries because journalists don't inform about them.  In fact, I've never seen the news of Iraq, Iran and Pakistan, so this article convinced me so much. This""discrimination""by media I very often think about. Its sure that since the terroristic incidents in the developed countries like USA, UK, Japan and so far are very rare and these in developing countries are very common, the shock of the former is much stronger. But the life is equal. The death of all people on this planet must be treated equally. ""another less comfortable explanation is that for much of the world's media, American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. "", this part of the article made me burn with anger. We must confront TV and newspaper with the feeling that the one death by homicide in Japan and one death by terrorism in Iraq are altogether the same loss.  When I heard news of Boston, I was very surprised. I could not believe that heavy damage was given by bomb terrorism in America. However, I never surprised when I read this article and knew bomb terrorism in Iraq. Just thought ""a similar trouble happened in Iraq again"". I was very shocked such my way of thinking. Because maybe many people think in the same way, I think it is not to be helped that world media focuses attention on Boston. I hope to decrease trouble in Middle East, and want to be a person who understand that the value of the life is equal.  I also felt quite strange because the media didn't report much about other sad events of the world. But since the people who work for the press have to earn living, I think it is so reasonable that they choose the news which attracts the interests of people more and cannot perfectly report based on moral perspectives. And whatever we said to them, they would never change their way of reporting. I think it important for us, who enjoy the media, to be conscious of inequality of the media, to pay attention voluntarily to the news which are not picked up especially, and to find them not less important.  I think that mass media treated American people and developing countries people unequally. I am actually likely to forget the blasting terror attack of Iraq and the earthquake of Iran and Pakistan in response to the influence of mass media. Also the earthquake of Sichuan was reported smaller than Boston news. I would like to have the media literacy and my opinion about the news.  I was shocked by this article. Why the mass media reported the Iraqi terrorism smaller than the American? Maybe people think that the Iraqi terrorism on 15/4 is less surprising than the American. So mass media reported American bigger depending on the interest of the viewer. The biased view is not mass media's but is our's. I should be more interested in the accident of the world without biased view.  It is very interesting that we can see people's sense of values from headlines. I was surprised how uniform the choices by the media around the world are. Frankly speaking, I felt the explosions in Boston is more remarkable incident for me than car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan. But it is true that the latter incidents are also matters which we should know because they are very sad events. We must keep in mind that news don't tell us all the incidents around the world and have will to find as many remarkable matters as possible by ourselves.  I was shocked by hearing the news. Because there are no tragedies like terrorism in Japan. But I think this is broadcast exaggeratedly. If this kind of matter happened in Africa , few reports were broadcast. From this news , I think the importance of life varies with the region.  The mass media have a powerful influence on private citizens, so unless they stop the gaps in news we can never achieve a harmonious and multicultural society. Also We should try to know voluntarily what is happening now all over the world. Only accepting something provided is dangerous for us and the future society .  When I heard this terrible news, It reminded of me the terrorism of 9.11 in USA. The explosion took the lives of general public so I hope the terrible trouble such this is never happened. And I want the news organizations to report the world news not only the famed cities but also small cities.  Although I think this accident is so important that media should cover this closely, this column implies that the media do not play the original part. The media should inform people of a news which happens all over the world equally. I think the management of the press is the main cause of this case, so we should reconsider about the interests of people who work for media.  When I heard the news, I couldn't believe my eyes. The scene was awful. Actually, the explosions caused a great deal of damage. Three people were killed and around 183 people were injured. It was the sad news. I was also surprised when I knew who the terrorists were. They were about as old as I was. I don't know what made them to do the act of terrorism, but only I can say is that innocent people died, even a boy of eight. I wonder if there is any other way to change the world. In addition, I got another impression when I read this news item. To tell the truth, I didn't know much about car bombs in Iraq and the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. One of the reason is that some media organizations failed to mention them at all. To know about the world equally, I think we need to get information carefully.  I agree the last explanation, which is that much of the world's media lay more emphasis on American lives than on the lives of people living in the developing world. Humans are a dime a dozen. Even if someone thinks me as his only girl, my life is worthless at the same time for an utter stranger to me. In that theory, the more I influence the worthier my life becomes. America is the most influential and the richest country in the world. So, it's natural that American news has priority over all other country's news.  I was really surprised at this explosions. Because I live in Hiyoshi alone, I do not have TVs. I though that this world continued to be peace until I heard it at that class. I am more interested in one thing. It is that ""World media focuses attention on Boston after marathon explosions"". Of course Many people thought that the explosions in Boston were the first successful terrorist attack in the USA since 9-11, which made it a significant event. However, I think ""American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world"". I have good reasons to think so. For example, USA have the most powerful economic power and fighting power in the world. If one country was less interested in this thing, it would be hated by USA. USA is also controlling world medias. USA is the biggest state in the world! I heard this news, I thought who caused this incident. South Korean, American, or Islamic extremist. This incident's perpetrators were American. One of the criminal said that I have no friends of American. Recently, I've been heard coverage of they were Islamic extremists. I don't know why they caused incident. Reason is not simple. But if they had also one American friend, this incident may not have happened.  I've heard about the news in Boston because it was broadcast by Japanese media constantly. But I had not heard about the news in Iraq, Iran nor Pakistan. I think mass-media should report news equally to people all around the world.  When I heard this news, I thought we can't predict when we face incident and who cause terror. In this case, criminals are ordinary young boys, bombs are made by pressure cookers, there are everywhere in the US How should we notice they are terrorist? How should we notice those are bombs? Probably citizens of Boston will become nervous, but I think they have to be friendly. Because, socially-isolated people will be terrorist.  When I read the article, I could not understand that media considered that American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. And I think that the media should deal with the news of not only the United States but every country in the world. The media should especially determine the weight of a life by neither a race nor nationality.  I was so disappointed to read this article, because of the difference in media's treating between American lives and the lives in developing country. I think that the most important thing is not the place happened event, but contents of event. Therefore, the media should pay attention to what kind of event.  When I read this article, I felt so sad. This news reminded me of 9.11. I cannot understand why people kill someone. Terrorism kill innocent people. This terrorism is the first time in 12 years. I thought no more terrorism would happen in America but it happened. We should think about terrorism again because it can happen anytime in America, also in Japan.  I think it is natural that world media focuses attention more on marathon explosions in Boston, the USA, than on catastrophes happened in other countries. Since around WW1, the US have been the most powerful country economically and militarily in the world, so it is no surprise that American news is regarded as very important. In my opinion, it is not the problem of different degree on worthiness in lives between nationalities. Americans and non-Americans, especially people in the developing countries should be the same in that respect. The Charter of the United Nations insists that we all have fundamental human rights naturally. However, when it comes to the big news like explosions by terrorists, the one in the US may be the most noticeable. It is because it is unusual that big strong country is attacked by someone. People would find it interesting or devastating seeing that kind of incident. Particularly in Japan, the relationship with the US is so strong that the media may run constant updates of Boston and not much of any other news. It is sad for me not to be able to see other countries' catastrophes and I'm sorry for them, but it is the reality.  I was shocked to hear this news. This terrorism is so terrible. I am terrified. But there are not only this terrorism but also other terrorism in the world. I think the problem is not the place where the terrorism happened. The most important thing is every terrorism are known by many people in the world. I want many media organizations report news in the world equally. I think every lives are worth equally.  When I heard this news, I thought two things. First of all, it was very regrettable that the sports event should be fun was a target of aiming indiscriminately citizens and tourists. However, I think we should review what coverage should be in future. Because focused on just this incident on the other hand, car bombs in Iraq and many casualties by an earthquake in Iran and Pakistan did not become major news. Certainly, this incident may be the case should be preferred, but tragedies happen all over the world. Second, not only we feel sad, but we should use lessons learned in order not to happen like this incident in Japan. In Japan, the sports event""Tokyo Marathon""like ""Boston Marathon"" is held every year. So I want so as not to inflict deep wound in the hearts of many people, we also Japanese review the security measures and share the information to be able to react to an emergency. At the time, I think not only authorities and guards, but we citizens should have the consciousness to cooperate is essential.  I was shocked by this news. But a lot of such cases happen in the world. I felt that Japan was very peaceful. However, it does not the reason why it does not need to know the world miserable news. We have to know the world event more. I think that the Japanese media should report more world news.  I was very surprised at the news about two explanations in America. I am wondering why the culprit wounded an uninvolved third party. I want the culprit caught immediately. I also think there is a rift between developed countries and developing country. We should treat everybody in the world equally.  I was surprised and ashamed of myself when I read the news and I found that many other sad events had happened in the world. I was also the one who paid much attention to the news of Boston bombing. I often hear there are no more safer countries than Japan around the world. But I think many developed countries are safe contrary to many developing countries. I suspect that many people also regard developed country as safe area. That is why I guess the accident in Boston shocked many people around the world. I think the preconception brought about the gap in news coverage.  The gap in news coverage is what I have been concerned about since around 10 Japanese people were killed in Algeria about 6 months ago, if I remember right. Japanese media paid great attention for that sad events and the media made too private reports too, such as how the casualties were adored be the people around them, how the trauma of the incident survived people have was going to be cured and videos of the friends of the casualties crying. On the other hand, the media made no reports of the reason why the peace is disturbed in Africa including Algeria nor the civil war taken place just 20 years ago that made more than 150, 000 casualties. One reason why there is such a gap is that those events happen almost everyday in the Middle East and Africa so the media simply cannot follow them, but I think pretty much every person in ""developed countries"" do not consider lives in ""developing countries"" the same as theirs. I am not sure if I can say it is wrong, but I personally dislike the trend.  When I heard this news for the first time, I was surprised very much. And I thought that it was terrible if a similar case happened in Japan. We think unconsciously that such a case which happens at the place such as Iraq should not happens at the place where we live. I think this is the reason of the gap in news coverage.  I got to know terrorism's occurrence and was very much surprised. I was not able to understand an offender. Why did the offender wake up terrorism? We must not waste people's lives. I was very sad for my having read this report to the last. That is because the media in the world have not made people's worth equal. It became impossible for a while for me to trust media.  I didn't know the sad incidents that happened all over the world except two explosions in Boston Marathon. To attract people's attention, the news media report the major news a little bit exaggeratedly. We should do not only to receive the information, but also to select and think of the information.  This news made me so sad when I see the news on TV. A spectacle which two bombs exploded together surprised me very much because it was so cruel. this article say that world media focused on this news excessively. I think too. There is reasons of this insistence. First, this tragedy happened in USA U. S. A is most major country. When terrorism is successful, it's influence is biggest in the world. So this news interest more people than other news which happened in The Middle East. I think media's reaction is natural. But I want medias to report various news. I want medias not to let people say ""American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world. "" I was shocked at two things about the news. One is, of course, that many people were injured and several people were killed. The other thing that shocked me was the reaction against the news. Many newspapers failed to mention about the misfortune in the middle east and many people didn't know the news. I'm also one of them. I felt really ashamed and thought that we must always consider a problem from different angles. American people's reaction also shocked me. After the terrorist was arrested people gathered and keep on shouted ""USA"" for a long time. They ""looked"" really happy and cheerful. We often this scene in USA. But, you know, this event is a tragedy. Terrorism has occurred and many people were injured, also killed. We shouldn't behave cheerful. Also we should think the background of this terrorism, not just behaving thoughtlessly on a given occasion. Why did young ordinary man did such a thing?Because he was from Chechen?Because he was a muslim(I don't think so)?There is always a reason behind such event. As long as people all over the world won't think carefully, and behave like part of American people we can't fight against terrorism in true sense.  I think this case is very difficult problem. Because, it contains two different problems. First problem is terrorism. As we know, terrorism is atrocity action. But, culprits may have something on their mind. After due consideration, we should take measures. Second problem is weight of life. I think weight of life is different depending on the person. For example, I think a useful man for everyone is heavy and culprit is light. But, it is not by nation, sex. This is just my idea. But, we should think many things from this case.  I became so sorry to hear this sad news. Many people are killed in the world every day, specially in developing countries. However, most of us ignore them. The explosion was occurred in America, the most powerful country all over the world, so the media broadcast this incident, I think. We have learn many things from this explosion.  I felt very sad to hear the terrifying news. Boston Marathon is one of the biggest sports events in the world, and so many people join it from all over the world. It is important and happy for us to connect with foreign people throughout sports if normally held. Therefore, I never forgive the culprits even if they have any reasons to commit a crime. However, there is a more serious problem behind this explosions. We all know the Boston bombing but do not know other terrible affairs happened at the same period of time. This is because world media organizations failed to mention them at all. After all, we general public are not given the chance to know them. Although some say there is priority in news coverage, I cannot agree with that because each affair always becomes the most significant to the relatives of victims. So, in my opinion, they should not completely ignore small scale matters around the world.  I was very sad to hear the news that many people was injured by this terrorism indiscriminately. To begin with, I became aware of this incident by watching TV, but I didn't know what other sad events happened in the developing countries. The U. S. A was so powerful developed country that the most mass media would report this incident. So I think the mass media is biased. However, I think that the mass media response is natural. The mass media usually have to select informations according to priority. So such a gap in news coverage always happen, in my opinion. Therefore, we must not only receive the information passively, but also get other information actively.  I think it's not about our respect for each life but about our interest. America is very influential over other countries because of business, politics and so on, and their culture such as their music and movies are popular to people all over the world. Above all, such a terrible terror hadn't happened in America since 9-11. On the other hand, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan are less influential for us. Furthermore, Iraq isn't a safe country originally, and earthquake is natural phenomenon. Therefore, the affair in America collects our interest more, and has more impact into us, so it's natural for media to put emphasis on that news. However, the news in those developing countries had to be known to people in the world. Then I think that media would show those news if we really cared about them. media is mirrors of what we think, so we have to consider about ourselves this time.  I did not know that the same day as this bombing had the automobile bombing in Iraq, either. However, more the incident of Iraq persons than a US incident have passed away. We think that we need to consider this fact more earnestly. Even if the country is rich, the weight of a life should not become heavy, and the weight of a life should not become light even if poor. I hope people in the world recognize this problem in this incident.  I was surprised at the explosions because after 9.11 America has clearly improved the ability of guarding. And in my opinion, the width of the gap in news coverage depends on the number of affected people. Speaking of this case, the incident of America, the center of economy and the leader of developed countries, affects more people than one of a developing country does. But this isn't justice. We should cover various news around the world in point of ethical view.  When I first heard about this news, I was shocked at this miserable incident. Especially, it was sad that the child aged only eight was killed in the explosion. This event may have reminded American people of the fear that they felt on 3.11. Almost all of the media organizations around the world reported this news soon after the explosion. But, they did not report some incidents that happened on the very same day; for example, car bombs at market places in Iraq, which killed over 30 people. In my opinion, the reason why there is such a gap in news coverage is the powers of countries. In this case, US has a great influence on the world because US has a great economic and military power. In contrast, Iraq does not have much influence. However, I think media organizations in the world should report world events that have dead persons as much as possible. This is because we should value all human's life regardless of his or her nationality.  This news made my interest in world media. This is because I knew the news about marathon explosions in Boston, but I didn't know about earthquake in Iran and Pakistan and car bomb in Iraq. From this article I learned we only know the news which media was take up, so our knowledge about world news is only a little part. I feel ashamed about this, and I thought we need to be more greedy about world news.  I think it is safe all over the world, because I can't feel the danger in Japan. But this news made me remember, and so scary. People always fight terrorism, war, and so on. I am blessed, so I should feel the world more to go abroad. Terrorism at Boston Marathon made the citizen scary, because 9.11 happened at the building of the high position, but this time happened at the very near position. People felt the danger of the terrorism, so hard. I think terrorism should fade out, so people should think more about the terrorism!!! There was no way these media was to blame. In fact the US is the world's economically biggest country. If such bombing accident should occur around the Wall Street, it will absolutely affect world's stock price, and a financial panic may occur. Also, since 9/11 happened, the US has been trying to acts of terrorism. Thanks to this, some attempts are revealed in advance. However, this bombing accident in Boston did occur. Seen from this aspect, I think these media treated this accident properly.  USA is very influential all over the world and the connections among the countries is strong. Furthermore terrorism has big impact to us. So, I think it was natural that media took it seriously. In addition, not only the case of sad news but in the case of ordinary news, there are the gap in the news coverage. Therefore, I declare the phenomenon was not caused by the gap of worthiness of our lives but the difference of our concern. And, I heard the incredible story that the explosion may have been fabrication, in spite of it was attracted so much attention around the world . When I knew that , I don't know whether it is true or not, I think we should not depend on limited information sources, and accept it without question.  In my opinion, mainly, news broadcast on media is an emergency. For example, the explosion in Boston marathon is exactly an unusual incident. But it doesn't mean that other incidents aren't important. Ideally, all things happened in the world should be broadcast on media. In fact, many factors - time, information and attention by people- interrupt broadcasting. In this condition, we need actively pay attention to affairs which aren't broadcast on media. This may make us familiar with much international information.  After I read this article, I was angry at the idea of racial discrimination. However if I think about it, I have such a idea in some small measure . Of course I don't think that American (Japanese) lives are worth more than the lives of the people in the developing world, but I think Japanese and American and the like people are excel at bottom. So, I think the problem of racial discrimination are not easy problem. But, I wish the world really without racial discrimination, and we must make an effort to exclude racial discrimination.  I think this is very important problem. America is one of the largest country. And many people are interested in matter of America. So media report news of America more than news of the developing world. But I think that not all the people think the news of America is more important than the news of the developing world. So media should report not only large country's news but also the developing country's news. I think that media must understand that the lives of people living in the developing world as important as American lives .  I think this media response shows the USA is the most powerful country in the world. If two explosions hadn't happened, other news would take attention. It is because those news are big news, too. However, because of the impact which the US has, they were not in the spotlight. That's the way it goes. However, that doesn't mean that you should ignore those news. I think you must notice those news even if they are not in the spotlight.  I think it is complex to arise the gap. and the world media overlooked the possibility of developing country. There are the gap between developing countries and developed nations about news, too. As we know, the U. S is one of the most effective countries in the world. and this is the nation which incurred tragic terrorism. so I think there are compound reasons to occur the gap of broad cast. Moreover, the developing countries have the possibility to lead the world. That is why I think the media have to attention these countries, too.  I think the importance of life should not be different depending on region. But in fact, media intend to broadcast mainly about developed countries, for instance the U. S, the U. K, Germany, France and so on. On the other hand, developing countries in Africa, Middle-east, Asia are rarely broadcast. If accident like 9.11 happens in Africa, this accident may not spread worldwide. I think this wrong, but in reality, this may be true.  Actually, I saw news of accidents in America than Iraq and Pakistan on TV. Of course, we must understand that American lives are worth as well as the lives of people living in the developing world. There is no difference between them. On the other hand, I think many people are interested in American news more than the developing country because of the power of nation. Japan has strong relationship with U. N. , so American news have possibility of having an effect on Japan. This reason applies other countries. As a result, World media focuses attention on U. N. after developing countries.  I was surprised at this news, and I was also don't know about car bombs at market places in Iraq, there were many casualties after an earthquake struck Iran and Pakistan. It cannot exist a discrimination. Lives of each people are equal.  I agree with ID13020's opinion. We are controlled easily by the mass medias. In this case, some medias reported about the explosion in Boston too much instead of reporting about car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. Actually, I knew about the explosion but didn't know the details of others. So, as ID13020 said, to make our knowledge wider the mass medias should spread the world's journalism .  I agree your opinion. I think the medias have to report any incident even if terrorism was happened in small country. Of course, it is the best that there is no incident to report.  I agree to the idea that people who enjoy the news should pay attention to the news in a variety of the world. I think if we have an interest in various news, the media will meet the expectations and, cover a story about the case of each country distinction, and I believe knowing the news diverse in that way is a chance to live better and broaden our field of view.  I agree with you. I think media have duty to tell public wider information, but we also have faults now. media didn't publish about them just because we usually don't pay attention to them much, so we should change ourselves at first.  This problem is very important. Developing countries sometime be attracted not much attention. Why? Because I  think that people take notice about major countries, and developed countries have information technology better than developing countries. We have to look at the world with a broad view.  I think media's great attention to this news is natural. Because the United States has been fighting with terrorist since 9/11 had occurred. After that terrible incident, not only American but also world people becomes sensitive about terrorism in America. It is true that other news are important, but this news is much more important than others.  I agree with your opinion. Unconciously we tend to lay stress on western country's affair and ignore middle eastern or African country's affair. But now we live in global age. We have to have wide range of view.  I have different opinion from umaumashiii. I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news.  I disagree with you because mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. I think it is impossible for mass media to do equally. However, I want to say too that it shouldn't ignore the news that they think affects fewer people.  I don't agree with you. Of course, terrorism maybe happen in Japan. But the most important point of this news is GAP I think. If we understand about contemporary condition of all over the world clearly, we can be more kind to other country, other people. So we have to require continual awareness of world before concern about terrorism.  I agree with her. We seldom pay attention to the developing countries. Newspapers do not report such incidents in the developing countries. As she says, we have to look at the world with a broad view.  I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news. I think mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. They should not make any difference between countries.  I think this media reaction is strange because making too much attention to Boston marathon's incident and not making so much attention to incidents which occurred around the world is wrong thing. So I think this media reaction is not correct.  I was shocked to hear the news. I think this happening is like a 9.11. It is very horrible. I wonder why some people do such a horrible act. I think these media say wrong and different things. It is cruel for many victims I agree with ID13020's opinion. Mass media should broadcast wider information. The wider the mass media broadcast , the thinner become the contents of the news, but we don't have to get all the information from the mass media. We should chose the topic from the mass media's broadcast and if we want more information, we can search for the Internet.  I was surprised by this article. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorisms should be published all over the world. But I think there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily. So, the mass medias should spread the journalism to make our knowledge wider.  As long as the value of our lives is equal, the amount of news about someone's death which is broadcast shouldn't be unequal depending on the nationality. I can understand that explosions at the Boston marathon have a big meaning not only for the U. S but also for us. However, it is very important for those who live in developed countries , including us, to be interested in events in developing countries because we tend to think those events are indifferent to us. Therefore , media have to consciously focus on news in developing countries for us to be interested in those news. "
JOC JOC-13B-09O 9.57 "I think washoku is wonderful culture and asset which Japan should be proud of. Now, Japanese officials are negotiating with other countries over TPP. I think Japan is not good at diplomatic negotiation. However, we have the great cultural heritage ""washoku"". In washoku, it is important to make use of materials and the climate of Japan and crops, livestock products and marine products which are raised in Japan. We have to show off the value of washoku and the importance of that crops, livestock products and marine products of Japan own are protected. Then, TPP negotiation and the economy may take a turn for the better by a brand power of washoku.  It's valuable and honorable that washoku was registered as the UNESCO heritage in 2013. I'm proud of many people eating washoku all over the world. Wherever we travel to, we can enjoy eating washoku. However, some of them are far from traditional Japanese cuisine. I think it is important to teach genuine washoku to foreign countries.  I'm a Japanese people, but I don't like Japan's traditional cuisine, known as ""washoku"", actually. I felt that it is wasteful not to understand merit of it. So I want to tell many charms of it to various people. In addition, I think it is good chance for Japan. Although western food is delicious, Japanese cuisine has other merit. We should protect it.  I was filled with pride on hearing of this news. Washoku's designation as an Intangible Cultural Asset is likely to have only positive impacts on Japanese people, society and economy. I think the fact that washoku has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list means we all Japanese pledged worldwide to inherit washoku. However, as the article says, it is true that washoku has been declining. It is Japanese that are responsible for succession of washoku. So, I want to contribute to that by learning the way to cook from my mother, not depending on fast food.  Probably, many Japanese people is proud of own culture. Needless to say, me too. But, I think Japanese culture is no longer seated Japanese living because of importation European culture. This news have potential to retrieve position what Japanese culture was.  I think Japanese people have to eat washoku more. If we don't eat them, we lose one of our tradition. So, I eat rice and miso soup every day.  I used to hesitate eating raw fish food, but when I took part in an international party, people from other countries strongly recommended me to try. From that time, I came to like Japanese cuisine. I'm so happy that Washoku is attractive to people all over the world and the fact UNESCO accepted it. I hope this will trigger to people who have a prejudice like me.  I think we can keep our health by eating Washoku. So, when I cook something, I always care about nutritional balance for my body. I consider that it lets to long life.  Now , people like to eat fast food. But fast food is not good to our health. Therefore , there are many people who are obesity. However , in contrast to fast food , ""washoku"" have merits of our body. So, I'm glad when I read this news. I hope that this matter lead good things.  I was happy to hear the news. I think Japanese food which is called ""washoku"" is the world's greatest cuisine. It is healthy and delicious. Although fast food is also tasty, it is bad for our health. When we eat fast food every day, it may lead to disease. We had better eat washoku every day for our body. I hope more and more people around the world to know about washoku and try to eat it.  I was glad to hear the news that ""washoku"" known as Japan's traditional cuisine had been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. I strongly think that Japanese love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" has a lot of seasonal foods. For example, ""JT002"" is a spring food, ""somen"" is a summer food, ""kurigohan"", in English ""marron rice"", is an autumn food and ""oden"" is a winter food. Therefore, we can feel four seasons a year, Japanese people are never tired of foods we eat. In conclusion, Japanese people love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" makes us notice four seasons.  In this year, we heard only happy news about UNESCO heritage status. Although, we has a problem with Korean. I hope the excitement cools down and UNESCO heritage status won't never sow the seeds of discord.  I am very happy to hear the news. I like Japanese cuisines and I want foreign countries people to know how good it is. Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy. I think it is rare characteristic of our foods I know many countries are interested in the Japanese food, but I did not expect ""washoku"" to gets UNESCO heritage status. Fast food is popular among young people. However, young people should care about their health. I hope that ""washoku"" are known as a healthy cuisine by this news in the world.  This summer, I went to the United Kingdom to study English. I was very surprised to find many Japanese food restaurants. In the United Kingdom, Japanese food is very famous and popular, especially for young women, because it is low in calories, good for health and delicious. However, Japanese food which was sold in the United Kingdom was far from ""true Japanese food "". It was difficult for me to explain what it was. It seemed like Japanese and Korean food. I think this situation happens all over the world. Of Course, I know there are some restaurants where sell ""true Japanese food"" in the world. I want many foreign people to know ""true Japanese food"" and know its wonderfulness, so I was happy to hear this news.  I agree with your opinion that Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy and it is rare characteristic of our foods. Many countries don't have seasonal changing, so we should proud of the fact. Japanese food reflect the advantage, so I also want many foreign people to know its wonderfulness. "
JOC JOC-14A-05N 9.94 "When I read this story, I thought we didn't know what the war was exactly. At the same time, I found the importance of the real story from people who live in which the war happened. It is true that we all learned about the happenings in the war when we were high school students, however, I think it is the most important that we have more chances to take actions to understand the war. Also, we should not consider the fact not being related to us. This is very important incident for all of us in Japan. According to this article, Japanese education puts too much attention to Tokyo. Therefore, I want the government to reconsider the curriculum.  Many people pay attention to the contents of the textbook. But it is necessary to obey the law. And the town should obey it. The teachers of Taketomi teach not only history but also moral as a subject. Do they really think their children will grow up honestly and get the skill as independent adults who have citizenship, even though they break the law because of their biased views of left-wings?Taketomi should keep the law as a role model of the children.  It is a very difficult problem. we should learn the second world war from various perspectives. But it is impossible to unify many perspectives about the war into Japanese formal history. A national history is an important element of the nation. So Japanese government is reluctant to teach wartime mistakes. In this case, I suggest that teachers in Taketomi teach the town's history not only civil textbooks but also hearing survivors story and visiting historical sites about the war.  We should offer all the students uniform education. It is true that it is important not to forget the tragedy. However, students who receive compulsory education cannot doubt what their teachers say and what textbooks say. Therefore, we should not have accepted illegal states. If you think that one law is not proper, you should change the law. Ignoring law is not right.  I don't know what is correct about this problem. However, I think that teachers who know the truthful history should tell students it. It is because if they don't tell the fear of World War, students and also we can't understand the fear of war. We, particularly teenagers, are not so interested in war problem. So, I think that it is necessary to educate youth not to repeat the same mistake.  I think the idea that the Japanese government decides the content of the textbooks is wrong. If it were possible for the government to decide it, the government could easily manipulate citizens will, and this is the same way which was introduced in the wartime. We the Japanese should never forget the experience of the wartime.  I'm able to understand Mrs. Nakamura's opinion. I'm always afraid of prejudice because sometimes we cannot find it, and I think education is one of the most contributory ways to make it. Like North Korea, if I was taught ""Our country is best and justice. "" from early childhood, and every adults around me said it, I would definitely believe it. A big authority can provoke people. We have to know about the fact and it is necessary to always doubt whether our thinking or education is right or not.  I thought that the textbook problem is difficult. Many Japanese people especially the young like me will not know the war in detail because we had never experienced it before. So publishing companies should write truth of the history and society concretely and make textbooks and we choose textbooks that we can think it useful and justice to study the best. I think it isn't good for nations to become pushy like dictating textbooks.  It is true that Mr. Abe's aim is to make Japan ""strong"" again. In fact, he argue that Japan should grow out of the post-war regime. But I think this poses the misunderstandings. He do not want the nationalism of the Empire of Japan to be back. In the flow of globalization, which make every nation connected with one another in terms of economy, social system, thoughts, and cultures, Japan is now losing its influence in the world, particularly in the East Asia. I think that a little conservative educations have potentials to change that situation. Although there is a lot of dispute about the contents of textbook (and I do not support extreme nationalism, such as affirming the war), ""patriotic spirit"" is now necessary to make the nation more tied, as well as taking account of Okinawans - who suffered from the painful war.  When I was an elementary school student, I had an opportunity to talk with a person who explained Word War Two. She said ""I was taught that Americans are very evil in our school. However, it was not true. After the war, I found out that they are ordinary humans and very kind. I remember that an American soldier gave me a chocolate. I think Americans are far more kind and gentle than Japanese"". I think that textbooks influence student greatly. we must defense pacifism and it is important in education.  We don't know what is true about the war, so contents of textbook have a major influence on learning children. There is various perspective in history. To see whole of history is difficult and sometimes textbooks are written conveniently. So we should have always critical thinking, which will help us understand how is the war. Not only we change perspective, but administration should reconsider how they teach children history and what is education.  When I read this article, what I thought at first was that education was powerful and could have danger when it mistake to step. I was frightened with Japanese education during World War Two. In other words, education is a kind of brainwashing. It has power which change our mind and our ways of living. Nakamura and her classmates were brainwashed by adults are militarism. This row about textbook is very difficult. I don't know which is right because I haven't experienced war and I am not from Okinawa. But what I want to say is only one. I hope that all young people receive right education so that Japan would not follow the same horrible way.  We can learn from this article that history education is very important for us and it effects its power on us. So its necessary to understand the right story. However, recently, there are some different interpretation on the same story and it sometimes cause international problems. For example, Japan and Korea have different interpretation on a part of WW2 each other. As the idea of globalism spreads to all over the world now, we must consider which story is the right.  I think we should take care about textbooks, especially when they include history. Because, we are influenced by textbooks easily and they are important tools when we learn about history. Textbooks should inform it neutral. Also, we should learn about war from people who really experienced it. They can teach us true stories, but they are aging (about 70~80 years old) and opportunities we can meet them are declined. So, we should convey true stories from them to next generations in order not to repeat disastrous war.  When I read this article, I wanted to learn about the true of World War II. We are convinced what Japan did in the war by education in Japan. I know that American in the war have an apologetic that killed many Japanese. They are very kind people. I think the education has led us to prejudice against Japanese history. Therefore, what is written in textbook does not give the correct information in talking about Japanese history of ever to us. A young people like us have to learn the true of Japanese history. Japanese have to accept any history to discuss fairly with China and Korea. I want a chance to take the correct education to learn about the true of the history in Japan.  I oppose to use textbook compiled by the state. It forces majority value on children. Don't impose majority values on minority. Everyone should respect human dignity. Otherwise, we repeat the history of tragedy of war. I think that local school board makes free decisions about textbooks. Japanese government should ensure freedom in education. We should imagine Okinawans people.  I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion. The war should not be happened ever. Sometime I think Abe check China a lot and poke Japanese patriotism and he want to change the Japan constitution. If the constitution will be changed, Japan might be militarism. Textbooks are same. I think textbook should not be changed. If it will be changed, students might be brainwashed.  I think it important for us to be taught the world situation exactly. According to the sentence, in the past, children were not taught world affairs. I think that it would cause a lot of problems. For example, if someone didn't know the fact that there are some colors people in the world, the person would discriminate them. It is so important for us to understand world affairs. So it is wrong for us to teach the world situation in error. But We still have problems that we sometimes teach the world situation wrongly. At first we should understand the situation and teach the situation in details.  I think that all of schools in Japan should use text book including the same contents. But a board of education in Taketomi should obey the law so that people in Japan are not fell in confusion. If teachers would like tell the students another story using other text, they do so. But they also teach common contents using a common text. They need to explain the difference carefully for their students. And history is so difficult and complex problems. So we need to learn and consider a problem from different angles to deepen our's knowledge about it. Not only schools in okinawa but in Japan learn about many opinions about history problems . And student think how do you feel, if you can't make your answer is no problem. The important is the process and the fact that students are thinking about it .  I do not know most about this problem. However, I know that I must never fight. We have a duty to hand down misery of the war. However, you must not twist history education of Japan on account of the country. It is a difficult problem, but there is the thing which you must protect.  About 70 years have passed since WWII was over. 1945, when Japan seemed likely to lose, have witnessed a lot of tragic events. Battle in Okinawa, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Potsdam Declaration. I think every event has to be taught at school and every Japanese have to remember them. However, I heard that some young people don't know when the atomic bombs was dropped and when WW@@@ was over, and to make matters worse, some of them don't know there are tragic war against USA and British(United Nations) during the 1941~45. In order to break down such present situation, I want the government to put emphasis on historical education.  I think a civics textbook should tell us what happened in World War Two exactly. World War Two broke out about 70 years ago, so those who experienced it are declining. That's why we have to listen to old men's war story carefully, especially Okinawa. This is because we must not break out a war and make Okinawa a front-line sacrifice again. Therefore I don't agree with Abe's determination to nullify the pacifist constitution.  Textbooks have a big influence when children learn some things. However, sometimes, there are wrong descriptions in textbooks, so those lead students to understand wrong facts. The contents about WWII are very severe. There are different opinions between Okinawa's education boards and Japanese government. I think the former should choose textbooks, because there are many people who experienced WW@@@ in Okinawa and people who live in Okinawa think about the war much stronger than Japanese government. This textbook problem is difficult . It must spend time to solve it.  Once, Japan was very strong country in Asia in terms of economy, force, and so on. But with the globalization that connects all over the world, and the rise of various Asia country like, China and Korea, Japan has lost her position. So, to take back former dignity, Mr. Abe may act hastily. I'm not good at politics, but what I can say is history is extremely difficult, and there are a lot of viewpoints . So There's not any right viewpoint. But what I can say with confidence is everybody think the same thing , that is, ""Peace is an important thing for everyone"" So, I would like the top of the countries, in other words, prime ministers and presidents to establish policies to create peaceful world.  69 years have passed since the Second World War came to an end, so few people know the tragic accident. We should listen closely to those people. War is one of the most terrible incidents and the only people who experienced it know how the war is. Of course I did not think only Japan was wrong, but I cannot judge whether my opinion is right or not. Today, recognition of history is regarded as important, Japanese prime minister, Abe, should think about war carefully.  Two years ago, I went to Okinawa for the school trip. I went to the cave where a lot of citizens sought refuge at World War 2. I felt cruelty of the war and I can't forget what I felt at that time ever. The reason why I disagree with Abe's policy is not a logic, but the feeling at that time. I don't want my family and friends to die in the war. I think the tragic affair like World War 2 mustn't do over and we have to find how to realize the peaceful world without war.  I think Shinzo Abe may be a nationalist and a little dangerous. He seems to want to revive warped patriotism in wartime. It can cause military conscription again. We should never go to war with any other countries. We should do everything possible prevent terrible tragedy from happening again. I felt protecting democratic and peaceful education is the most important thing all over again by reading this article.  I think a textbook specifies children's thinking. Therefore, we should become earnest for choosing a textbook. First of all, it is not so good for a children that country and rural areas decide a textbook. Biased and simple of people's thinking may cause a running wildly of the nation. I think in order to stop that bat situation educator has to teach that a textbook is only one of the opinions.  This is a difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.  The influence of textbook is equal to brainwashing. The powerful person of Japan should take reader's damage of heart caused by war.  During the war, the education was used in order to justify nation's policy. In fact, there were wrong things in the textbook of the day. this article said ""She and her fellow townspeople want no more of Tokyo-Electric education that glorifies the nation and recognizes war as a just national expedient. "", and I agree to this. I think Thus resistance against Officials must need not to break out the war again.  I think that text book which is used in junior high schools and high schools should be written in the very right things. Of course, there are so many different interpretations among people. It is because interpretations are changed, depending on the individuals who feel differently on the same situations. But historical facts which Japan occurred could not be changed. For example, Japan government has an intention to legitimate the incident which did holocaust in Nankin in China. I understand many misunderstandings by Chinese bother Japan. But in Japan students are not taught about such things in detail. Thus we students want to know about the right historical facts and government should be more obedient to the historical facts.  I think education is very important. For children, adults are absolute so if adults teach wrong thing, children would believe. In this case, people who live in the area hate Tokyo because of their wrong education. I think the right of option for education is in people live in the area.  I think that we have an each opinion on war. It is bad that some people reject other people's opinion. We should respect people's opinion.  After reading this article, I feel that I don't know what the war in Okinawa is like and we should forget it and tell next generations. In order to do so , we must study status of Okinawa. Japanese education put importance on Okinawa.  I know the war has a some reason. After all the war is prohibited.  i am afraid of president. okinawa is the important place. so he should be more careful.  When I read this article, I feel that we should learn more about World War Two. In Japan, there are few people who went through the war. So, we must ask them the story about the war to understand the terror of wars before they died. We must also transmit the terror of wars to posterity. I hope wars will disappear from the world.  I know the war has a some reason. Of course the war is prohibited. However, it is not a bad thing to tell about war even if that war is bad. This is because we must not forget terror of the war. So, I think that the education to teach misery of the war should be done from now on.  Okinawa is some Japan. Now, the problem of the right of collective self-defense is subject. When war occurs, the place which is related first of all is Okinawa. The problem of Okinawa is not every person.  I think that it is difficult to determine whether it is right for current us because there is really little what person was experiencing this war. However, we must not forget it about war and think that I have a duty to try to do right understanding. You must write the truth to the right textbook which is used at school so that it is understood. I think that you must let children study the truth. As well as a thing of Okinawa, I think that it is necessary to let the nation do right understanding about the war whole to prevent a thing same as twice from happening.  I think an idea of the Taketomi is very cool. Since Mr. Abe took office as the prime minister, Japan has had a tendency not to regard the war absolutely bad. In addition to this, Tokyo was not the battle field and only places which were invaded seriously can hand down the tragic story to the coming ages. So cities like Taketomi should voluntarily make an original textbook by which children can feel the reality of the war and understand how terrible the war is and consider how to eliminate the battle between or among nations.  I felt like something doubt the truth of true when I read this article. Children learn history through textbooks. The contents of the textbook must have a significant impact on children. In this article, I was aware of the existence of women tell the meaning of the war. I think there good or bad, but I think I want textbooks to tell the importance of the real war to children.  I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion. The war should not be happened ever. I think that everyone should tell the children truth. By doing so it, I think that we consider this problem carefully and children can do right choice.  Histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions. So sometimes histories cause troubles. I understand both sides. We have no correct answer that one of them is wrong. We need more time to reach an agreement.  I want to agree with Mrs. Nakamura's opinion. We tend to forget the prejudice. Also, education can be the hotbed to do so for students. The knowledges which are taught in childhood is difficult to erase and change, so we should be more serious about the fact and it is always necessary to criticize whether our way of thinking is right or not.  I thought that the textbook problem is difficult and histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions for them. But i think it is important that telling truth for next ages with textbook.  I think the problem of textbook is popular. Textbooks reflect editor. So textbook can intently be distorted, but they should tell truth as possible as.  This is a quite difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.  I want the countries including Japan to keep good relationships because I love peace. Wars must not be happened again.  When I read this article, I think This problem is very difficult and complex. I can understand each sides. I think each sides are correct.  I think so too. War must not be brought about again. Not to make serious battle between nations, we also have to hand down the tragic story of the past to the next generation.  I think textbook problem is very difficult. Children don't have the ability to think critically. Therefore, teaching a partial world view in Japanese history means brainwashing. Education should be provided in neutral place.  Education has two sides, virtue and vice. Depending on the its content and way it can be used for peace or war. So people who educate other people must think them and their happiness. All education which people who don't think it do are bad and wrong.  I think nobody likes a war. However wars occurred, is ongoing and will never perish. This is a political and also diplomatic issue. But we can avoid the war. That is why Mr. Prime minister is now trying to change the constitution. He would not like to start wars and repeat the tragedy such as the battle of Okinawa in WW2.  I think stories of the people who underwent the WW2 are important and we have to respect them. However many people experienced the war so each of them has their memories about it. We should not focus on one story. We need to search a lot of stories and analyze them.  I disagree with your opinion a little. Indeed it is true that we have various opinions respectively and we must respect them, but the war is clearly bad thing and to hand down the tragic history to the coming age specifically is clearly good thing.  I disagree with your opinion. I think it is terrible that the government try to plant some radical ideas to students. However, I think it is important to deciding some contents which every students should learn by the government.  I disagree with you. Because you do not know that the content of today's textbooks of national history is also wrong. The standard of selecting information today is unclear. make matter worse, if we want to publish, we only have to find it is written in something without backing. And a lot of national hIstoric societies are left wings. So they published textbooks as they want. And Abe try to change this situation, and protect children's rights of education.  I support Taketomi's decision because Taketomi choose right choice and resist nation's power for children.  Wars killed many people. So nobody want to do wars but wars often happen. Therefore , for not to do wars , we should educate children .  I agree with this comment. I had a school trip to Okinawa 3 years ago. We studied about Okinawa and listened to the person who survived the WWII. High schools in Japan have histories class. But it can't teach all histories. Japanese government should give the chances to study histories more.  I felt sad when I read this story because Okinawa was only place of a ground war. I think that Japanese government should rewrite our text book of history to tell children truth. Sorry, I was absent from this class.  It is important to think about the World War II. But we must think about it. There are a lot of opinions on the premise that it is not again cause the war. For example, Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution say that it does not have any forces. What is the force? Is ""Jieitai"" the force? I don't know because the Constitution does not specify. So I think the government should establish the definition of neatly forces in provisions rather than the interpretation.  When I read this story, I realized we didn't know what the war exactly was. At the same time, I learned the importance of the real story from people who overcame the war. I think Japanese government ignore opinions local people have. Japanese education curriculum Abe tries to make is too conservative. We should learn World WarII history from various perspective. "
JOC JOC-14B-26N 8.93 "I worry about the secrets law might infringe the freedom of expression. Why do they think that they cannot defend the national interest by the National Public Service Act(existing law)? The government should explain this issue. The purpose of the news is to criticize the government. Thus, news media have to reveal the secret of the government. The government must not set ""Secret"" freely.  There are some people who are oppose to secrets law, but can we say all of Japanese people are interested in it? Last year, there are many demonstration against this law, but lawyers mainly composed it. Perhaps secrets law infringe on our freedom of expression, so we should not only develop of the law, also enhance our interest in it.  I think so too. We should get more understanding of this issue. Therefore, the government has to strengthen the disclosure of information. Why the secrets low is necessary? Government hasn't confidence of the people if doesn't achieve accountability about this question.  The problem which is included in the secrets law is its vagueness. On one hand we can protect ourselves from the other countries, but on the other hand, we may not know the essential information for our lives. Such is discomfort that we cannot know the fact and cannot decide what we do. This is so controversial issue. Thus , we Japanese consider it carefully.  Even though these law have great power, they are in some way necessary, because every nation surely has ""key secret information"" about troops, national security, technology, and the like, which the conventional law system was not always able to protect. So I do not say the security law - much stricter version of the previous law - should be absolutely banned. And the idea of establishing ""the check organization"" that is composed of prominent scholar and bureaucrats is also plausible. However, as John Acton said, ""power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. "" In fact, the definition of ""secrets"" is still very vague and arbitrary, which might violate our freedom of speech. What is needed is a clear standard and so-called ""limiters"". In my opinion, a few liberal scholars should be adopted to the check organization as members, and the media's coverage of the law should be critical, so that government limits its power that can be absolute.  Certainly, I also think we should be ashamed of Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and Japan should change the policy. However, I don't think Japan should accept tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. Compared with other countries, Japan is small country and legislation does not go ahead through Japan. For these this reasons, I strongly disagree with this comment.  The article points out the Japanese society is indifferent to immigrants and refugees . I sympathize Japanese society have a interest in the problem which is related to themselves. The classmate commented two points, so I choose it. First, Japanese government's attitude. Second, the problem is serious, so the article should be reported more in Japan. I sympathize the two points.  I think the secret's law will make a lot of criminals who haven't confess their sins but commit the crime. though Japanese government need get the confidence from international society especially US, the rights of people of Japanese must have priority over it. We must establish trusted third party and continue to fight the law.  I sympathized with yo so much. I think we must increase the number of people who are interested in the dangerousness of the secret's law. We must try to generate information to indifferent people.  I strongly agree to making a law to protect a secret. There are some reasons, but it is one reason that many countries except Japan make such a law. I think that a lot of very important information exists in running a nation. Of course, it may not be said that useful information for some people may not be considered to be a secret. However, it is too dangerous to announce all information like our country. Even if information says all as for the coming times, it is not exaggeration. Therefore I strongly agree to make such a law and protecting important information.  I think that more people should be interested about this law. This law is not a simple law. Therefore I think that it is necessary to understand at first what kind of law it is definitely. There are a lot of laws that only expert people know, but, as for a lot of these laws, it becomes news. There is the person whom the agreeing person objects to, but thinks that it is important that each has one's opinion. Therefore I am agreeable in your opinion that the people should make more interest.  I agree with This comment. Looking back, There may be alt of people who should be blamed too. But as him (commentator), when I hear this news, I was confused and indignant too.  Protecting our national secret is very important thing. However if a government ignore the public's right to know it will be difficult problem. Japanese once experienced world war, and have make good use of the experience. It is natural that we be worried whether this Japan's secrets law lead the next war. So, promoting the national interest, Japanese government should make great efforts, I think.  To tell the truth, I'm against the state secrets law. Certainly, thanks to the law, Japanese government would administer the country easier than otherwise because politicians, bureaucrats and diplomats could negotiate a lot of things with counterparts without showing our nation's weak positions. If they can do so, the negotiation would turn to our advantage, and we Japanese enjoy the benefits in our daily lives. However, just because the government tries to maximize national interests, it doesn't follow that the government can deceive a nation and hide secrets which shouldn't do so. I think that giving priority to national interests doesn't mean that they can ignore the rights to know which all of us have. Therefore, I disagree with the state secret law.  I heard this news for the first time, and was very anxiety about a return to the days of Japanese militarism. The new law would be protect from intelligence leaks on the one the one hand, would limit public right to know on the other. Every law includes benefits and risks. So the government must explain the citizens who are opposed to it until they understand. And even if his approval ratings fell down, It shouldn't forgive that the change was being rushed through parliament with little public consultation, I think.  I also felt Japanese immigration system was very fragile, and it is the matter of grate. We should make better system of immigration as soon as possible.  I do not think so. The right to know is not like as you say in the academic world. And there is no relation with the information which we can get through the right to know. National secrets are admitted by any constitutions in the world.  This is the great first step of Japan. We had no rules or laws about secret information. We never surrender the spies. I believe this law make Japan better. I cannot understand why the left disagrees the law. The law is necessary to be strong Japan.  I know you're right. it's a double bind. Introducing a law always entails demerit. Japanese government should've asked public's opinion about that.  The Secret Information Protection Act, does indeed seem to be a necessary and reasonable way to protect information from cyberterrorism and foreign espionage. However, there is a danger of information that is important or inconvenient to the Government being hidden from the public. In addition, the checking system is unclear, which jeopardizes the people's right to know. The Government must hurry and set up a third party committee that can check and decide classified information on a more neutral stance.  Maybe secrets law looks necessary and effective to prevent the leak of state secrets. However, by applying this law, government can arrest people who give disadvantage to government and details of this arrest will not be reported to us. So I think this law is not always good.  I agree with you. This new law might threaten freedom of expression. And I think we citizens should tell the risk more. "
JOC JOC-14B-29N 9.63 "I love British Royal Family's involvement in a wide range of activities that called ""Noblesse oblige. "" Especially Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge are popular and very influential among people. So their activities will make international relations be better one I think.  They are very popular around the world. Their activities are admirable. It is said that Americans like ""royalty "". Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. He devotes himself to government affairs. There are various opinions about royalty. But their attitudes is wonderful.  I like this kind of news very much, especially related to prince William and Catherine because I'm interested in Britain. They are very famous and popular even in Japan but I didn't have enough knowledge about activities by Royal Family's. Therefore, after reading this article, I wanted to search about their activities more and more and could get information! I knew about ""Noblesse oblige"" in detail and I found this idea very nice. Actually, I cannot experience their activities and feelings but I imagine that they have both good points and burdens. I think that ""what they do"" is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world, so in this article, I think it's very nice to visit a child development center and the happening that Catherine was mistaken for being a princess from Frozen made me laugh. As a lot of people pay attention to activities by Royal family, I think they are so admirable and have great meanings. I hope that they can help to promote relationship between countries.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I watched the TV broadcasting of their marriage ceremony in 2011. I felt so, so happy to watch it! And I am looking for seeing their second baby. I want them to come to Tokyo with their children. I believe that their visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  I think their visit to the U. S is not the one which is criticized because the U. S has no royalty and royal family is very popular among American. Indeed there is a serious problem about shooting or choking black guy by white police officer in the U. S, but it's quite irrelevant to the UK and duke and duchess are popular even among black people, for example Lebrone James mentioned above. Therefore, their visit made a good effect on the country, I think.  I also drink tea everyday and I think drinking tea is quite natural in Japan and I'm strongly proud of this custom. He says we have to cherish our custom and I sympathize with his attitude to our grate tradition.  I liked and agreed with your comments. in the era of international exchange, British Royal Familys attitude may become the model for viaduct of peace. Their popularity and sincere attitude will be the model which we should follow. Although some have negative opinion about them but I think they are wonderful and good symbol of UK.  When I read this news, I was very surprised. I am very interested in British royal family. So, this event make me glad. I always thought that people of the non-royal family did not associate with the royal family. By this matter, the way of thinking of people was replaced. Triggered by this, I hope that the relations of all the countries of the world become better.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much, too and I also felt happy. The second baby is born soon. This will bring joy in the world. By this matter, i hope the relationships among many countries become better and better.  This comments said that ""it's wrong for sure to invade human rights. "" I especially sympathized this. I also think Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and PRAJ should change a policy. For these reasons, I strongly agree with this comment.  It's because his opinion is too extreme, that I can't sympathize with his comment. You can't agree to the comment which has only tea. When drinking too much even if it's good for a body, it's bad for a body.  The royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. Originally, I like the British royal family. After I read this article, I like this couple more and more. They have very big power. So, I think that they should use this power for peace of world. Having good relationship become method of the peace. I want them to continue this event.  They are famous all over the world. They are loved and attracted attention by people in the world. Therefore their action is very big influence. This problem was causing a big ripple all over the world. Therefore, I think that I want you to have a good influence not the bad influence. If their power is used to become peaceful in the world, I think that you should be used at many opportunities.  I very love this couple, and they loved a lot of people in the world. I can't wait to see their baby! I hope they will come Japan. And I think Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. Prince William and Catherine's attitudes is very wonderful.  I agree with your opinion. When I watch this couple, I feel happy! I hope they visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  It is because I am same as her opinion ""drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking. "" I think everything is said excessive much as possible too. We should control myself.  The royal couple is very famous in the world and has an enormous influence, so they are being taken notice by the world all of the time. Superficially their life is simply magnificent and bright, not only that, but they live with struggling with a heavy feeling. Their word and action can have a powerful influence on the international situation in a positive and negative way. They are in the terrific position. I anew notice that by read your comment.  British Royal Family is loved by people all over the world. William and Catherine took the world by storm 4 years ago. This time they are given attention, too. I want to know why Royal Family is loved like this.  I like this kind of news. I'm interested in Britain, too! You searched about Royal Family's activities to satisfy your curiosity. That's very nice action. Voluntary action makes you an intellectual. I will follow your example! The british royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. I like the news!!! And, I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I am berru The second baby's news gives us great pleasure. This will bring joy in the world.  I agree with you. I want the royal couple to promote the peace of the world.  I like the british royal couple too. Therefore I am glad of the news to make people of the world happy in this way very much. Their influence is big because they are celebrity, but it will be to welcome him that it has a good influence. I want to support them who gave people of the world joy so that you say.  I think it is nice British Royal Family's activity that called ""Noblesse oblige"" . Prince William and Princess Catherine are very popular in the world. So what they do is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world. I hope that they can help to improve relationships of many countries.  I agree with your opinion. They make many people happy. I respect them. I want to do so. I have a lot of things to learn from them.  I saw happy news after a long time. They give us happiness, so I love them too. I want them to help restoration of diplomatic relations all of the world.  They are popular and famous all over the world. So they have a great influence on people all over the world. I believe that their visiting can improve relationship of many countries.  In this article, what is important is the easiness. Article says drinking tea in daily life is good. They doesn't mention about how useful it is. I think his comment is way off the mark.  I was interested in his comment. However, he said that he will drink tea only. I am worry about his health. And I want him to understand drinking too much tea is bad for your health. I want tell him that it is not good to be too in everything.  I think so too! Their work is the most peaceful to cooperate nations without any interests. Their actions are likely to be mistaken for easy work. In this case, they received the message ""You want to see our city, but do you care about our problems?"". But I believe their actions make good relationship between british and other countries. I want them to continue this event too.  It's a heart-warming news. Most of the news on this site seem to be very serious, so I was relieved, reading this article. I like them, and wonder when they will visit Japan.  Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing them.  First, I knew this fact before Iread. second, three cups a day is not ""only"" for me.  I am surprised at that so many classmates love Prince William and Catherine!! I also love them very much, too. Their marriage in 2011 was social event on a global scale. Of course, I watched the marriage ceremony on TV. I want Japanese Imperial Household to be loved many people in the world like them. If they have the second baby, I hope their visit to Tokyo with their children. Their visit to countries will make the relationship between the countries better, I think.  The royal couples are known around the world. Maybe, a lot of people love them. I am one of them. This couple has power to make people be happy. I think they can help to improve relationships of many countries.  I think so, too. This news make us calm. I hope they come to Japan! I approve your opinion, too. Behavior of a royal family can have a good impression very much. I'm interested in continuation of an exchange with non-royal family.  I like this news and the British royal couple. They are very famous all over the world and have a great influence of action. For the peace of the world, I want their couple to visit all over the world and contribute to the peace. "
JOC JOC-14B-31N 8.8 "I think the Abe Administration does not understand the value of the constitution. The purpose of the constitution is to bind the government authority. So, all policy-makers must follow constitution. Though, for example, Abe Administration is going to infringe the freedom of expression with the secrets law. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority.  I think that I want Prime Minister Abe to review a constitution carefully. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election, and a one's thought street may surely act. However, he must not forget that there are the people of the opposition either. There are a lot of people of the opposition about the constitutional revision. It was a fact to have won in this election, but did not get support of the whole nation in it. I want him to examine it carefully for even slightly many nations to become useful.  I am concerned about possibilities of misunderstanding of Prime Minister Abe. His election this time ended in a landslide victory for him, so we tend to misunderstand it as if all Japanese people support him. However his party could not obtain a majority of votes. Therefore I would like him to deal with political problems carefully, especially Japan's pacifist constitution and relation to China.  I think PM should propose the new article 9 as soon as possible. Chinese government officials and the press of the Communist party said they will invade East China Sea and Pacific Ocean. Obama is reducing the army. So US cannot take part of maintaining the security East Asia. So Japan should do and oppose with imperialism of China. In fact they invaded and rule East Turkistan and Tibet even now. They support Pro-Chinese in Okinawa and want to make the island the part of Chinese. We cannot ignore Chinese invasion.  The Abe administration should advance the constitutional amendment while considering more carefully though there is a strong movement under way to carry out it. The constitutional amendment has only enforced once and it is a change from Meiji Constitution to the present constitution. By having the right of collective self-defense and preparing to use armed force in Japan, it has a great influence on other countries. If Japan don't think about having military force while deliberating on a relationship to countries which live in a state of tension.  I agree with your comment. If there is a strong movement under way to carry out it, some opposes his plan and great confusion will prevail throughout the country.  The opinion has a lack of balance. I think the conclusion of the Abe Administration is inevitable though Mr. Abe is a rightist because it is undeniable to have military force for Japan to get along with other countries.  I think that Prime Minister Abe should think about a little constitutional importance. To change the constitution may be connected in changing Japan in itself because it continued being the Japanese Supreme Standard of Laws after a war. Japan must surely consider about constitution Article 9 again while there is the menace of neighboring countries such as China or North Korea. However, the Abe Administration does not change a constitution easily and must push forward a story in consideration of the public opinion of the nation.  I think that Abe is a good politician and the Prime Minister because he has a strong faith and behaves in accordance with his faith. However, I think he must be calm and pay attention to opinions of countries around Japan. Now, the relationships of Japan and neighbor Asian countries have gone cold turned cold. It just arouses their hostility for Abe to persist in his opinion in this conditions. He should consider opinions of other countries and carry out politics wisely.  I think this is the most important problem in Japan nowadays. Prime minister Shinzo Abe was re-elected by public and hs said that this re-election means Japan have to rewrite the country's pacifist constitution. However, according to some newspaper's research, though the Liberal Democratic Party win a majority, people who support to rewrite the constitution is a lesser proportion. It is strange story, isn't it? This research means a lot of thing, for example, there are no reliable party, and also may mean interest groups power are being stronger. Can this say that this time's referendum shoe the will of the people? I don't think so. I want to keep studying these political problems.  I agree with you. Prime minister and there colleagues must consider this problem. This is very important, so they shouldn't be hurry to get conclusion.  As we know, Mr. Abe have long shown his biggest desire to change the current constitution, which is a symbol of post-war era, that is to say, the international situation that restricts Japan's bold and free action in terms of territorial, economical, social issues. And then most of citizens voted the LDP, so in a way this action can be viewed as ""a consensus"". However, we should not allow him just to proceed. In speech, we can say opinion against the policy. This way, we can make the administration consider carefully whether to enforce it.  I agree with you. Major issues in this election are economic policies. People is none too sure of constitutional change. Abe should forges better relations with neighboring countries and considers the idea of Article 9.  You have a very good viewpoint and I respect your attitude. In my opinion, the seemingly contradictory situation - where those who support the LDP do not necessarily stand for changing the constitution - comes from the reality that the majority of Japanese people are being ""voting machine"" in some way. I mean, there are many people who vote but do not have interests in politics. They vote without deep consideration, often haunted by disappointment at Japan's current political situation. I believe that, in today's democratic society, citizen's spontaneous actions like demo and speech are crucial. So, to begin with, WE should change our attitude and consciousness toward politics, eventually enabling democracy to function. That is what I have in mind.  I think that he understand the essence of constitution. Constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. So, Abe changes the constitution without hesitation only because won the election. Abe discusses carefully whether to change constitution.  This comment of his or her has very sharp consideration and poses questions to the current political situation that can be conjectured in the article. And I also try to have such critical and positive attitude, so I greatly sympathized with him or her.  This news has so important problem for Japanese, also for world countries. I think Mr. Abe is good prime minister, I trust him. However, I can't agree with revising the constitution completely. Firstly, I can't understand his aim clearly. I'd like him to go ahead discreetly.  In the first place, we did not expect the election. We want the government to take action positively. I was anxious about revising constitutions. In particular, the prime minister Abe try to change the interpretation of Article 9 which is a symbol of peace constitution. Finally, his desiring was to allow Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense. I think that he should have explained us about its merit and demerit more detail. It is most important for the current government to listen a national opinion. Japanese constitution is established by tradition and history. Therefore, we have to be more careful when we consider the constitution in the future.  This news has so important problem for Japanese. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. We should consider the problem carefully.  I agree with you. Important problem in this election is economic policy. Few of people think constitutional change.  Article 9 of the current Japanese constitution rejects acts of war and weapons of war. Japan is one of the few countries whose constitution renounces war. I think it is natural to protect our own country from a threat from a neighboring country. Japan has been peaceful since the end of the Second world War under the constitution because we have been under the umbrella of the US . Meanwhile, a lot of people support Article 9. They love peace and claim that Japan should convey to the world how terrible war is and how precious peace is as the nation hit with a nuclear bomb. I am able to understand what they say. However, I believe that Japan should be more independent. That's why Japan is criticized for being subjugated by US .  I am able to understand what you said. However, I disagree with you. Currently, the far east is smoldering because North Korea tested missiles and nuclear weapons. I think that it is just because of the strict observance of the constitution that peace has been kept since the end of the Second World War. However, the present international situation is dangerous. This is a time of decision I think so too. I expect his ability to take action. I cannot understand his goal of revising the constitution. It is important to explain us more detail.  Changing constitution is not considered carelessly. As a matter of fact, Japan has been kept peace on the basis of this constitution. I oppose to the right of collective self-defense because this right means taking part in wars in the other countries positively. The prime minister Abe just wants to do great program remembered by later generations. There are few people who experienced World War II, so now is the very time when we reconsider the importance of peace and the effort of Japan so far.  I agree with you. The prime minister Abe play a good role about economy, but he has scant thinking of history. I think this constitution, which we have been followed, should be kept.  I strongly believe that we should not change the constitution. Wars do not produce something happy. On the other hand, they just bring misfortune. I have no experience of wars, but I was told how terrible they are by my grandfather. I am satisfied the original condition of Japan. We should avoid exposing to danger.  I doubt the Prime Minister truly understands the purpose of Japanese constitution. The original purpose of it is to restrict leaders' authorities. If he change the constitution without understanding it, I think it is very dangerous. In addition, I oppose changing the constitution. I am proud of our constitution which refers to ""peace"", and I hope this idea spreads and influences all over the world. It will be the model of the world, so I think we should search for the other ways to keep our global position.  I don't understand why is this election hold. Abe is very smart in this point. In this situation, it is clear that Abe will win this election. If Abe win this election, he will able to continue to do longer than now. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election. But I think it is not the support of the nation.  I agree with you. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority.  I'm opposite to your opinion, too. He has a mind to make Japan go to the war. Japan has a wonderful constitution as a peaceful constitution. That's Japanese pride and I think the wisdom which arrived by the history with the long mankind. The person who doesn't look back to the past has no futures. Before our country amends the constitution and has military, reflection in the past should be reconsidered again.  I'm not supporting Prime Minister Abe. Only distrust is held in how to advance it his dictatorial politics. The same atmosphere as before the Second World War is because there is current state which has happened.  I think now is the time to rethink our constitution. We should prepare to make sure our national security. The situation of East Asia is at risk. Because Japanese economical power is strong, the only country which can deal with China and Korea. We cannot ignore their presence and imperialism.  I think Abe's policy is anachronistic. As other countries say, Abe should learn from history. Although we don't have military, and face a crisis from North Korea and so on, Japanese people remember WWII. That war leave scars to many people. Abe should reconsider this condition. All the Japanese people also should consider our own position.  I think so, too. Abe won the election, but he must not forget the purpose of democracy. We should go to the election to vote if criticize his policy.  I am also anxious about revising constitution. And we should consider more carefully and make a big deal of it. However, I think it is not because the constitution was established by tradition and history but because the constitution exists for the sake of prevention of national runaway.  I think we should discuss whether the constitution would be changed or remained. I think it should be changed because the environment has changed. The constitution is old fashioned. And, the new constitution by L. D. P. is better than present one. It is enough to change it. We should improve the constitution and the country! Wait a minute. Many constitutions around the world say the pacifism and also new constitution will show the same idea. We can never change anything if you say what we do not change means peace.  Because she thinks peace is only kept by words but I do not think so. the world is more complicated than pacifist know.  The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan enjoyed a landslide victory because they brought up the economic policy as the main issue. However, Prime Minister Abe's real intentions were to amend the Japanese constitution. He does not even understand the purpose of the Constitution, and just wants to rewrite it the way he wants it to be. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. If the Constitution is re-written into something convenient for the Government, the Government will go out of control. We must watch his moves carefully.  I agree because I also think Mr. Abe doesn't understand Japanese constitution. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. He doesn't know that. Nevertheless he start to ready to change the constitution. This is serious problem.  The constitution should not be changed because of its tradition and history but because it is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government.  I think we are short of opportunities of discussion. We should discuss more and more. Japanese government should explain this matter in detail and more times. we, including me should understand this matter in detail. Now I think Japanese people is the lack of understanding.  I agree with you. This matter is so complex. We must learn Japanese constitution and think whether we agree or not agree with Abe carefully.  This problem is very important for us and we Japanese should be interested in and discuss it. I think the citizens' opinion is not fully reflected to politics now. It is very bad thing and maybe can be called crisis of democracy.  I agree with you. This problem affect foreign countries as well as Japan and it is not good action seen from them.  This comment is inconsistent. I think Mr. Abe has not carry changing Japanese constitution through yet. It will be decided whether Mr. Abe is good minister from now.  This person is not aware of danger this law include. "
JOC JOC-15A-09N 8.47 "I don't know advancing the construction of a new US base by the governments of Japan and the United States is right or not. If it is not right, we have to prevent Japan from moving in the wrong direction. As Kenzaburo Oe believes and Yoichi Higuchi says, we should believe citizens protesting and support them.  I believe that the governments of Japan and the United States should not advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. First of all, there are many people who oppose to build new base at Henoko. Japanese government should listen to their voices. Additionally, nature and ecology of the sea at Henoko would be destroyed by building new base. All in all, we have to oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. We should not only talk but also take actions to protect land and people of Okinawa.  I oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko because Japanese government ignore the voices of people in Okinawa. We should take actions to prevent building new base.  I can't agree with the construction of a new US base in the Henoko district. Because it may lead to destruction of the environment. Beautiful sea which various kinds of sea creatures live in should be protected. Moreover, the mental burden on the locals will be too large. I disagree with the move to revise national security legislation and the constitution too. I want Japan to remain a peaceful country as it is Around Henoko of Okinawa where the mammalian dugongs of the sea in the crisis of the extinction inhabit is one of the sea areas where biodiversity is the richest in Japan. A human being does not have the right to break the variety into. If Japan and the United States which are a developed country take the lead to perform the environmental disruption while the world sings environmental protection, the other countries must be angry. I think that they should think about not only the political element but also the environmental element and should make a conclusion for the issue of transference.  I think so, too. Environment is not the thing which a human being may destroy. In addition, the human being grows by nature, and anyone know that we are healed by its beautiful scenery. I think that the transference supporter should reconsider such a natural idea.  I oppose to advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko, too. Now, the relationship between the Japanese government and Okinawa is not good because of US bases problem. It is important to discuss the political issues. In addition, I assume we need to think about the environmental issues to protect the beautiful environment in Okinawa.  I support Abe on this point. The construction of a new US base is necessary for Japan. Protesters are usually emotional and what they say is a little worthy of listening to. To cope with threat od China, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity. The right of self-defense is guaranteed as the natural right. So, there is no problem that Japan exercise the self-defense right.  To begin with, there was an agreement with America. The Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama spoiled it. If he had not become the Prime Minister, the construction of a new US base would have advanced.  X= people in Okinawa necessarily disagree O= people in Okinawa do not necessarily disagree This is the first time I've heard this. I oppose the construction of a new US base. We should protect nature and beautiful scene. I think it good that famous persons like Oe take concrete action. And Japanese government has to lend an ear to the voice of the people living in Okinawa.  I think so. If more US base is construct in Okinawa, it will impose a burden on Okinawa. And the friction between Japanese government and Okinawa will worsen. So, I think Japan and the United States should not advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko.  I often go to Okinawa. Seas in Okinawa are very beautiful. We can look fish which is swimming because water is very clean. Therefore I strongly believe that we should protect the nature in Okinawa. In addition I really looked Okinawa US base. Then I was very surprised because airplane was very fast and very noisy. I think that US bases are very dangerous and harm for people who live in Okinawa. All in all, I think that we should think about US bases and produce the solution.  I agree with you. Sea in Okinawa is very beautiful and there are many farms of sugarcane. I strongly believe that we should protect these nature. If we set up the US base in Okinawa, it connect to destroy the nature of Okinawa. In addition, US bases are very dangerous. Therefore Japanese people should insist that stop to set up the US bases in Okinawa.  Unfortunately, I have never been to Okinawa. However, I often see clear sea in Okinawa on TV and the Internet. Nature is great and respectable. If China attacked and occupied Okinawa, a lot of factories would be constructed. The factory would emit toxic sewage and smoke. Therefore transparent sea in Okinawa would be destroyed. To keep the clear sea, the construction of a new US base is necessary.  I disagree with Kenzaburo Oe for some reasons. It is true that some people say that the construction of a new US base will spoil clear and beautiful sea in Okinawa. However, China is threatening Japan with the navy today. So, Japan must more cooperate with America. And protesters such as Kenzaburo Oe do not show a concrete counterproposal. They are emotional and sensational.  I know it is not a good thing for Okinawans, and many Japanese people disagree with the new base construction in Henoko. However, although the Japanese people disagree with it, nobody help them. Any prefectures give their name in place of Henoko. Therefore, this issue does not advance for a long time. All governors in Japan should discuss about it, and if they cannot solve the problem, the Prime Minister Abe has to try to discuss with the US  Natural selection is inevitable. If the construction of a new US base were called off, it would be easy for China to attack Japan. If China attacked Japan, as a result, nuclear weapons would be used. Human beings would be extinct by nuclear weapons. Is it a natural selection? God knows it. However, we must keep the prosperity of human beings. Therefore, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity for prosperity of human beings.  I think this movement which famous people take the lead in insisting on peace is very effective because people tend to be influenced by them. People in Nago may be encouraged to have hope by them. Recently, the government of Japan attempt to change the interpretation of the Constitution, especially, Article 9. However, many people are against this idea. I think we should protect Article 9 just as it is because it is a symbol of Japanese peace. It has passed 70 years since the Second World War was over. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and think about Japanese future developments.  I totally agree and am with Mr. Oe's position against the construction of US military basement in Henoko since it seems that the government has not learnt we have so criticized about the base in Okinawa. Even if Japan are forced to have them because of the lost in WWII, we have to minimize the number of the bases as it produces lots of harms like noise and crash.  Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to take priority on thinking about our lives first. And there isn't much threat of China for instance and even afterwards too I think, so we don't have to extend our self-defense power. If we do that, it will irritate other countries of course.  I agree with Oe's idea, what the Okinawan citizens will win. And I also wish for it. I think the problem of Futenma air station is unreasonable. All people should have the right of living peaceful. So it is very dangerous thing to change the constitution. Not only Okinawan people but also all Japanese people who think so too should try not to happen the situation.  I think, if China want to attack us by nuclear weapons, they do it although we don't have the Henoko base. That's because Japan have many US bases already. I can't understand why we need more bases with people's pain.  I oppose new American base. Why the government disregard nation's voice. I think that what's he does is Japan before the WW2's government. And Okinawa's things is to reflection the people who live there. What Mr. Oe who works publicly act this like is the important things . Because famous person have a great influence.  I agree with Oe Kenzaburo, even though I don't like his literature. Although, where will Futenma base move to? It is impossible to move outside the prefecture. I predict that the base will remain Futenma.  I agree with your opinion. We have to protect the beautiful nature of Okinawa.  I have never been to Okinawa, but I know that there are a lot of problem about World War two and American armies in Okinawa. Henoko's people disagree with the new base construction. I agree with people in Henoko. Japanese Prime Minister Abe must try to discuss about American army with American politicians.  Okinawa used to be a one country since it had own culture. I think Okinawa should be one public culture. But Okinawa's own economic is not enough to support its country. "
JOC JOC-15B-01N 9.02 "I felt very sorry to know such a sudden and big typhoon caused such calamity in areas of eastern Japan. I have not experienced such a typhoon or disaster, so that I cannot have a clear image. However, I strongly felt that the evacuation order by public office was late to reach people there. So, it resulted in widespread damage. Therefore I hope that the evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage.  I agree with you. I think it depends heavily on evacuation orders whether a lot of lives of disaster victims can be saved or not when terrible natural disaster occurs. I experienced 'the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake (March 11 2011)'. At that time, Critical infrastructure was severely damaged by the earthquake in my hometown. So we always concentrated on listening to the evacuation orders on the radio. I heard that my friend couldn't survived from Tsunami without the evacuation orders on the radio. Therefore I agree with your opinion which evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage.  I agree with you. I think it depends heavily on evacuation orders whether a lot of lives of disaster victims can be saved or not when terrible natural disaster occurs. I experienced 'The 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake( March 11 2011). At that time, Critical infrastructure was severely damaged by the earthquake in my hometown. So we always concentrated on listening to the evacuation orders on the radio. I heard that my friend couldn't survived from Tsunami without the evacuation orders on the radio. Therefore I agree with your opinion which evacuation order should reach quickly to decrease damage.  I felt sad to know the disaster. The town of Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture, is near my grandmother's house, so I was shocked to watch flood on TV. When the disaster was happened, I was in Tochigi. In Tochigi, there are many damages too. For example, the water supply was cut off near my town because of rain. And, I think that education and announcement to the disaster was not enough. In the result, there are people who were late to take refuge. However, the rescue by the Self-DefenseForces and cooperation among residents ware great.  I am very sad to hear and watch news of natural disasters in Japan. I still cannot believe this happens in the same country. At the same time, I learned a lot of things from the news. For example, we should never go back to our home to take something important because our lives are the most important. I also felt it is reassuring to know rescue team like Ibaraki's DMAT. I think the ties of local community are getting lost as Japan is urbanized and so I hope people can help each other at any time.  I was very surprised when I read this news. I think that I should think about solution in the case of the flood. Nobody know that when the flood comes, so everybody think about solution. I talked about this news during class, then one girl told me not to drive a car if a flood happen. I thought it a good idea. I intend to check an evacuation site and refuge course. There is a river near my house, so it is very dangerous. I want to talk with family about a way to evade.  I agree with you. Many typhoons come to Japan, so a flood is easy to be caused. When a typhoon comes, it is important early to evacuate. Therefore everybody should check an evacuation site and refuge course. Moreover Japanese government provides evacuation sites. All Japanese people should know this news and everybody should think about what should we do when a typhoon come. I agree with you. I often use internet for watching movie on Youtube and listening music. However I don't know it is an illegal act. A lot of people use internet for watching movies and listening music like me. Almost people does not download movies and music. It's difficult to understand a law for the general people, so I think it's better to increase more chances to learn a law.  I felt really sorry about the disaster caused by a typhoon in Joso, Ibaraki prefecture. And I was dreadful, because I live along the Tama liver. The awful flood was a shock to all people in Japan, and gives a lesson to us. For example, a city hall should have ordered a citizen to evacuate, and people should not have thought themselves to be safe. Many typhoon hit Japan every year, so the flooding like this may cause us so much trouble again. That's why we should take measures to deal with the situation. Lastly, I hope that the region which suffers from flood can revive completely.  I read this news, first I felt very surprised. This is news when large rain fell in North Kanto. Kinugawa overflowed under this influence. I watched this news in my house. Many people will criticize it by this disaster. The method is a helicopter, a ship. I thought that I did not want to experience it. The flooding of the river was like the tsunami. The flooding of Kinugawa was slower than a tsunami of Fukushima. The damage has a bigger Fukushima than Kinugawa, too. But, it is terrible when I think that this cause is a typhoon. Because it is the thing that is possible for me. There is the Tama River in near my house. It will become like this disaster if this Tama River overflows. However, it may be said that it is activity of the Self-Defense Forces to have had few dead people. I respect the people of the Self-Defense Forces very much. They went on fighting the rescue at the risk of their lives. They are very cool. I will help me if have a disaster us. By this disaster, I realized the importance of the Self-Defense Forces some other time. I cheer Self-Defense Forces. 200 wards I live in Ibaraki. And my father was born in Joso, Ibaraki Prefecture. So my grandmother's house is in Joso. My town is Tsukuba. Tsukuba is a near Joso town. When this massive flooding happen, my grandmother evacuated to my house because of rising water. She stayed my house for 5 days. After that my family helped to clean her house. But I feel it was good because my grandmother is living. Some people died for this disaster. And I watched the TV show about this news every day. I was so sad because it was different landscape which screened in the TV from that I knew. But now, that place gradually revives. I want to support something for that place.  I feel sorry to hear what happened in Ibaraki. The picture of the article shows how terrible it was and it reminds me of 3.11 earthquake and tsunami which attacked Iwate and Miyagi prefecture. Many people suffered from each disasters. This time, there are not so many people who were heavily injured, but most of people living in Joso lost their home and necessities because of the flood. Some people criticize mayor of the city and they claim that mayor has a major responsibility for the disaster. It is true that he is responsible for this disaster, but no one could anticipate such a heavy rain fell and the banks of Kinugawa burst due to the rain. I think people have to think not about the responsibility for it but about solution how to help people who lost everything. To help people is a matter of the highest priority. Also, authority has to consider about the disaster and the way to prevent the disaster like this next time. I hope Joso to be rebuilt as soon as possible.  I agree with you. No one could expect such a terrible disaster to happen, so education and announcement for the disaster was inadequate. The authority should not forget this disaster, and they should learn from and act on the lessons of their failure. I hope them to think seriously about the incident and find great solution to help people as much as possible from such a heavy disaster.  I felt sad to know again the danger of the natural disaster. Abnormal weather conditions like unexpected torrential rain have recently become rather normal in Japan. Local government should make full preparation for sudden natural disasters. It is important to evacuate and support materials promptly in particular. People who live near the river should confirm the evacuation center with family in advance and store food for two weeks. Not only the government and municipality but we also must be prepared for the unexpected natural disasters. And, I anticipate good use of the drone to supply materials. It is why the drone can carry the goods to the place where people and trucks cannot enter. The manner of drone is uncertain yet and the danger of abusing it. So, I want the government to advance legislation about the drones.  I felt sad when I heard this news. And I'm sorry for victims of this flood. The day of flood in Ibaraki, this information was broadcast by news programs, newspapers and so on. Some days ago, I watched a document TV problem. A family which live in Ibaraki was attacked by a flood. At first they didn't escape from their house. Because, they had grand mother who is Alzheimer's disease. They left their house and went to a public hall which be located at high place. But water came up rapidly. And the power went out. So they called a rescue party. They were saved. I was scared when I watched this TV problem. And I think I need to get ready for environmental pollution.  I feel sorry about Ibaraki people. No one can expect this disaster. Japan has many disasters. Hearing ""disaster"", as eastern earthquake in 2011, many people notice some earthquake. The authority said there may happen big earthquake early at Kanto. So many have watched news about it. So we did not think rain cause such a flooding. I read another article about this disaster at Asahi Shimbun. On September 10, 2015, 7 people were died, and 4, 400 household were flooded. I think that government was able to minimize the number of the dead. However, many house or building or their field were damaged. Government should prepare embankments and drainage facilities.  This article reminded me of the big earthquake happened in Japan on March 11 in 2011, what we call ""higashinihonndaishinnsai"", Great East Japan Earthquake. I am very sorry to the people whose family of friends were killed or are missing. I think what is the most important thing to prevent these tragedy is to be ""nervous"" in a sense. This is true for both government and ordinary people. Above all, government or local public body should develop the laws in order to warn residents to evacuate as quickly as possible. For example, they should make the evacuation advisory at the lower level. In my opinion, they should even reform the entire law system for disaster prevention if the present one is not enough. In addition, the ordinary people must be more nervous; more careful at these warnings. If the level of the advisory become low, there will be much more false information. Even when the TV news report that big earthquake will happen, it may not. But, we must not relieved. No one tells when it will happen completely exactly. We must not ignore the warning and should always pay attention to them. Needless to say, it is ridiculous to be always too nervous. If we are so, we will be able to do nothing but seclude ourselves up in our house. However, we cannot prevent the disaster after it happens. In Japanese, there is a proverb that ""Korobanu sakino tsue"", ""prevention is better than cure"" in English. It is depends on our consciousness whether the evacuate advisory of the lower level will be ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" or not.  I think so. This tragedy may happen to anyone in Japan. Nobody knows when it happen, so we must not think that this is somebody else's problem and we are safe. The best thing is carefulness of each people. This is also said to the other natural disasters such as eruption of volcano and great earthquake. Though governmental or social system for support is certainly essential, the most important thing is awareness of each people. So, the local government must make effort to generalize how we should behave in emergency, especially among children and the old. They cannot escape immediately when the disaster happen unless taught what they should do in advance, then people around them should help them. And I do not think the residents of the region will completely be freed from flood, but they may can escape from it with no damage by preparing for it to some extent. After all, I hope a speedy restoration of the disaster-stricken area.  I have been thought of this accident as optimistic, but after reading this article, I reconfirm the concern of rain and water which we see unintentionally. We use water on a daily basis, terror of water is not understand for me because I don't experience it. For example, flood, typhoon and unexpectedly strong rain. Most of us don't think rain and river as a real threat, too. In this case, the flood in Tochigi prefecture is rarely catastrophe, which is equivalent to the Great East Japan Earthquake I thought. Surely, it is disregarded because the scale of this flood is small. Regarding the Great East Japan Earthquake, this was a big devastating accident. Many people was killed and affected. While this flood is happened in Tochigi only. However, both is the same natural disaster. That many people was affected is the same thing. A person whose house is poured, a person whose family was killed by the flood, a person who was forced to live in the haven. There is a various people in it. As a result, the same when the accident happened regardless of the number of people. So we should think plan to protect this accident on this occasion. The time to recover the life of the people who living there might be long, so we think properly and do it as possible. At first, we are needed to make a plan from close thing such as caution and discuss with our family.  I think that big natural disaster increases year by year in Japan. I was surprised at the news of Kinugawa gave away very much. There are several causes that damage of this natural disaster has extended. It is to have greatly hit the Japanese Islands directly a strong typhoon so that the first is rare. In late years abnormal weather increase cause of the global warming. A huge typhoon goes ashore in sequence in this summer and is warm so as to be abnormal in winter. I went to the amusement park for an imprudent thing in the typhoon on front of it day. It is the second cause that a Japanese crisis sense is light as for this. A collapse of the river is not an unpredictable thing. The neighborhood resident should have had more senses of impending crisis.  This news is very pitiful. I went to a training camp of a club at the same time. When returning to Tokyo and seeing news, I was very astonished for a shocking picture to flow. I lived near the river and the sea, so this news was felt very close. I don't know when such terrible accident occurs, so usually, I thought it was important to prepare.  Since I was in Indonesia in summer for two weeks. I didn't know this news at the time it happened. But I can tell how much damage it made by just looking at the pictures. I feel really sorry for those who got damaged and happened to be the victim. We cannot prevent the natural disaster from happening but, we can try not to get a huge damage. Therefore we should be prepared for those natural disasters.  I feel sorry to victims of misery flood by tropical storm. The banks and levees of the Kinu River were broken. This is so big storm beyond our expectation. There was nothing to do it. However, I am dissatisfied with the measures devised to deal with. The problem is late of official financial support. However, the government went through huge earthquake of east Japan, they cannot make use of the experience.  I am sad to hear the news of this flood. When I watched the news, the picture of flood came as a shock to me. No matter how science and technology progress, we can not control nature.  I am very surprised to hear the news. Japan is faced with disasters such as flood, earthquake, and so on. There are many rivers in Japan, and if we don't have enough preparing, we can be exposed to the thread of flood. Natural disasters can happen anytime, so we should be careful not to be involved in it.  I brought back the past in 2011 when I watched this news on TV. When tsunami occurred to be caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake, I saw damaged areas on TV every day. I still remember that I felt so confused. I am from Miyagi, so I know some of my friends who lost their family and their home. They are making efforts to live back even now. A national disaster is unable to stop happening, so people can just get emotionally prepared to save their life. It takes a long time to return to their old life, but I want them not to give up. It needs that more people corporate to recovery and reconstruction for victims.  I totally agree with you. I am very sad and sorry for people who suffered from the sudden flood and typhoon. Even though, natural disasters are unexpected I believe that we can do something to help people who are still suffering. Now is the time for Japanese spirit of caring should reunited. Japanese should be together for the bright future.  I agree with you. We should confirm the evacuation centers with family in preparation for disaster, such as the floods and the earthquakes. People who live near the river must have learned a lesson from this flood in North Kanto. It is also important for us to put the lesson of past disasters to good use.  I agree with your opinion. The information about disaster should be announced widely, speedy and exactly. "
JOC JOC-15B-06N 9.9 "The refugees issue is a world common problem. When Japan often is received criticism for Japan pays only money. However, I think that it is difficult to accept refugees in Japan, because it is still a body with the prejudice to a foreign worker. Prime Minister Abe stated that the activities by women and elderly people and economic growth are more important to Japan than the refugees issue. This way of thinking is not wrong, but he shouldn't have declared it for the world. It is natural to have to cooperate with the solution to world common problems as a diplomatic part. The Japanese should feel the refugees issue close a little more and it is necessary for the government to show posture to cooperate in the world.  At first, I thought that this problem is very difficult and serious when I heard this news. But I think that Japanese government should not accept refugees. Because I have two reasons. First, there are a lot of problem and people who need a help. For example the welfare of the elderly person. Second, if Japanese government accept refugees, I think that this action will make the confused situation in Japan. After that it will make new problem in Japan, I think. By these reasons, I think that Japanese government should not accept refugees.  I was very surprised when I was known this news because I don't know this news. Japanese government should spread Japanese news. The problem of refugees are very important, so Japanese people should think about this problem. The problem of the emigrant are serious problem now in Japan. Refugees are different from an emigrant. However it does not different that a foreigner comes over to Japan from foreign country. The problem of emigrant has various opinions, so Japanese government should think about refugees and Japanese people should know this news.  I agree with the latter half of your opinion. Abe's argument sounds as if Japan lacks international cooperativeness. Even though other foreign countries declared to receive refugees, as for Japan, it sounds too selfish not to show the willingness to take in Syrian asylum seekers. Indeed, Abe's view itself that we have many things which we should do before accepting immigrants or refugees may be to the point. However, I think it is not appropriate for the answer to problem. It avoids the point. No one in the world would expect such an answer of Japan. Subsequently to the problems about STAP cell, the Olympic emblem and the stadium design, as this rate, Japan will lose its credit more severely in the world. On the other hand, I think Japan's financial assistant is enough contribution to refugee problem. Both financial support and receiving of refugees are essential. Furthermore, I can understand there are many problems with accepting of refugees. However, in terms of international cooperativeness, I think Japan should receive them little by little, and become one of the global players in resolving the problem.  I think Japan should accept a victim from Syria. Various problems may form by accepting a victim. But it's good that Japan is criticized by other advanced countries when only aid money is taken out to such international problem. I think so I should cooperate aggressively to such international big problem.  I strongly agree with your opinion. Thinking of people who are in danger of terrorism is very important thing. It is true that accepting people from Syria and other middle Eastern countries is risky thing, we should know that most of them are victims and only a few are terrorist. Saving these people is not easy thing, but understanding that kind of situation is necessary. Trying to help those people is the first step to make world peace.  I think Japan has to accept refugees. There are so many challenges to overcome, but we have to step forward due to strong growth of Japanese economy for the long future. Japan is closed country in fiscally and mentally. We can say it is strength of Japan like ""Japan has grown without interference"". Maybe it is true. But I think it will become failure in the future. We have to change fitting in this era that everything move globally. Any more, we shouldn't say the word of ""global"" because it's natural. Global is standard. Refugees will give us diversity, workforce, and growth. Of course, we need totally new solution to build high-level relationship with refugees. First, we need independent budget like fund for refugees. Only government cannot manage them by means of using only our tax for refugees. Creating a fund and financing variety of investors like corporate investor including sovereign wealth fund, the affluent population and so on. And we use this money for business mainly with refugees. Of course, in this proses, we have to invest a lot of money and time for education, welfare. Anyway, I mean, refugees don't have much credit capability, so the fund finances them and support their business. For example, connect them to the specialists, companies, overseas country and other fund. So, why we have to finance them taking lot of risks? Because refugees have double nationalities. They know and have network in their originate country. There is a business chance, isn't it? They will become key businesspersons. In this ""global"" era, there are fewer areas where aren't developed by advanced country. In almost developed countries, many countries and many companies are doing their business. So these countries generating refugees are kind of last frontiers. Accepting refugees is high reputation, high risk and high return. This is another war in global economy and politic.  I have totally the opposite opinion about this matter, since Japan is now facing the problem called ""Aging Populations. "" I think accepting a immigrants is one of the good way to prevent that matter. There is few young people in Japan right now and there will be less and less in the future. So accepting a immigrants could make the situation better, they can be a workforce. There might be a troublesome things to do to accept them. But you need to think about what you can get and lose by accepting them.  I agree that Japan accept refugees. Before that, we have to think about their future environment like. house, education and job. As we are worried to face population decrease and following short of the number of the people who are employed, Japan should willingly accept foreign people who are seeking place to live in. But it is as Japan take care of damage that The United States and other countries caused in Syria. I think someone must stop them from bombing innocent civilians who just wants to live with peace.  Accepting many Syrian refugees is not easy thing. First of all, Japan is not next to other countries, so called island country. This means that Japan rarely were exposed to different culture. That made Japan unwilling to accept foreigners. Of course Japan pays a lot of assistant money to help these countries, but other countries want Japan come to the cite, and help these people directly. If Japan don't go to the cite in fact, it is little sense to pay aid money. Also Japan should accept immigrant in terms of humane way. This kind of act can bring Japan some benefits.  I somewhat disagree with your opinion. Aiding money itself is enough to help these people because Japan pays so much money.  The refugee problem is a difficult issue all over world. Many developed countries face this problem. In Japan many people think that if Japan receive refugees they may commit a crime. And by the reason of that they disagree with the reception of refugees. However there are no evidences. Japanese prime minister Abe recommends the activities by women and elderly people and these activities will lead to economical growth in Japan. I think this way of thinking is OK. In addition to these, to receive the refuges also may be the good way to growth the economy. Why does prime minister Abe don't want to receive them? I think Japan should receive them positively.  I don't agree with you. The refugee issue is serious and common around the world. The countries not separated by water are starting to accept the refugees. But it is bad to leave all them. Now we must cooperate between countries. Surely, if we accept many refugees, some confusion may happen in Japan. But bigger confusion must happen in their countries. When I think it, we cannot help helping them, I sure.  To accept refugee is one of the biggest problems in this world now we live. Today's world have lots of refugees like political refugee, displaced refugee, economic refugee and so on. But World countries become severe when they are put under the situation they may have to accept refugee. There is many reasons they are unwilling to accept such people. First of all, there is almost no preparation to accept them socially. Every countries has poor people. If migrants lead a better life in front of them, they are likely to be vent of their pent-up feelings. Since this disturb public order, government avoid accepting. Secondary, the power of immigrant is uncountable. refugee is really hungry, , physically, materially, mentally. If such aggressive people entered a country, they may take place of the origin citizen. This is really horrible for people. So officials and people are wanting to avoid accepting such people. But accepting such people to some extent is good for economy, and it will also contribute to solve aging society. There is a good sides and bad sides to this problem. It seems that Shinzo Abe is facing a really difficult choice. But I think to manage to do with such difficulties is also a responsibility as a prime minister of Japan.  I agree with you because Japan has responsibility as a large country and every countries should take up this problem.  I think the problem of refugees is very serious. Because of the civil war in Syria, more and more people have lost their places to live. Therefore they have no choice but leave their own country and go abroad to live safely. I guess most of us think that it is not related to Japanese people. However, the problem of refugees is also important for us, although Japan and Syria (this country is in Middle East and next to Turkey and Lebanon and so on) are not near in the term of distance. But globalization has continued for this some decades and supposed to be continued even from now on. Then we must think everything more globally. Thinking about the problem of refugees from Syria, in my opinion, it is almost impossible for Japanese government to accept them safely. There are some reason. First, it is said that it is difficult for them to live in Japan. Because in Japan, only Japanese is spoken. I think the refugees from Syria cannot speak Japanese. The difference of language is very serious when it comes to living abroad. I think it not easy for them to learn Japanese because their language and our one is very different. Next reason is that if we accept the refugees, without doubt Japanese order will be broken. I mean, I'm sure our country will lost current safety. Let me take an example of attack at Paris last year. It happened in 13th November. It was big surprise for all of us. Because this attack, a lot of people passed away. Some media says that those who did an act of terrorism is try to behave as if they were refugees when they entered inside of France. It is the reason why some people think that it is dangerous to other countries to accept the refugees from Syria. When it comes to terrorism, everyone has possibility to have involved in the accident even if how they are careful about their environment. As a matter of fact, the United States of America decided to stop accepting the refugees saying that it can be harmful to American peace. Believing any religion too fanatically can kill people- I thought so when considering the conflict between different religions. Most of refugees don't have will to kill someone or to cause terrorism, but some do. That's why it is very difficult to accept refuges.  I think so too, refugees do not have a choice to leave their own country or stay there. However, it is fact that some developing countries still have not prepared for refugees to create an environment to live. If Japan accepts refugees, it might costs a small fortune although Japan has huge budget deficit. Nevertheless, I consider Japan should accept refugees as much as possible, and now is in time to take in refugees with Japanese hospitality"
ACA ACA-A6U-004 -9.7 "Previous Convictions Paul Wood Against Postmodernism: A Marxist Critique, Alex Callinicos, Polity Press in association with Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1989. pp. 207, ISBN 0 — 7456 — 0614 — 8. £8.95. What is it that makes this substantial book produce, mixed-in with its rewards and knowledge, a depressing effect? Does it matter? Callinicos' own apology about publishing yet another study of an over-worked subject notwithstanding, it remains an important contemporary debate. It isn't that; the more so since Callinicos' contribution contains a significantly original dimension. Despite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine. Uncritical testimonials to the postmodern's attractions are ten a penny, and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer. This study has the distinction of being both critical and radical, essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieu's interests in a period of overall stagnation. It is ‘of course’ unlikely that Callinicos' criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmodern's corners: movementist politics, the radical academy, post this-ism and that-ism, a variety of well-upholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it. Too much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them. Maybe this is one reason for depression, then: that the book's well-wrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects. This indeed has already happened. Callinicos' Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well, Marxist. It leads to the Gulag, you know, and is patriarchal to boot(translation: Marx had a beard). Given that Callinicos' book is difficult, and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated, I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are, and what they are not. In the first place, as the title makes plain, if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch, and the consequence of that claim, that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one. Callinicos' criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases, the three principal ones of which are: First: advocates of the postmodern in art (which attains uncommon prominence in so far as the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism), tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period. The main ones of these are: the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding, the laying of one text over or against another; the relationship to historical codes of representation; and the relationship to popular codes of representation. Callinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism (predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn) in order to demonstrate that the latter is a good deal more complex in respect of its characteristic conceptions of the subject, expression, reflexion etc, than the former are wont to have it. This is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avant-garde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of such as Eliot, Joyce, the Cubists, Surrealists and others (including, somewhat surprisingly, Kokoschka). A further set of more qualified — or at least less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered, by authors such as Lyotard, Jameson and Lash. These include: the postmodern as a tendency within the modern; a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernism's related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality; a distinction between the postmodern conceived in terms of the externalised and impersonal as against a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’; and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally rather than discursively (?). Callinicos' conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts, built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism, these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’, manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’(p. 28). It is in fact Callinicos' later claim that, rather than occupying a qualitatively distinct position, ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’(p. 53). The second main emphasis of Callinicos' critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture, viz. poststructuralism. Drawing on  his own previous work, as well as that of Dews and Habermas, the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida, and the ‘contextualist/historical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition; and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to which,a fortiori , post-structuralism succumbs. These concern: the subject; the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject; and, perhaps most fundamentally, the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests tout court , of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality. This is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways out of atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos. There is no space here, central though it is to Callinicos' argument as a whole, to do other than note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic, Habermas. If Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage, Habermas' main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism, manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’, and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speech-act theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson, as well as to Wittgenstein. In essence then, at this philosophical level, Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy, as it were Marx and Wittgenstein, in order to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms: principally that tradition, dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism, descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard. Compelling as it is, however, this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos' case. The third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy: which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern. There are two pillars to this account: the emergence in the post-war period, and more particularly in the last two decades, of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated as well as distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie in respect of its structured ‘overconsumptionism’. And secondly, the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid-1970s. The latter is primary; the emergence, or at least acceleration, of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the re-entry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom. This kind of argument reads well in Callinicos' hands, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness. A real tragedy has taken place. If one only takes educational institutions such as universities and colleges, let alone the world outside, the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned inside out. What began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism in terms of a materialist demand that the socio-political locale of culture be addressed, in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a self-serving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art. This stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender. What amounts to a fear of art, perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches. And it touches a lot. Making all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce, watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise out of the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing so much as witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution. It is one of Callinicos' main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics: the claim, as one of his own critics has had it, that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’(Patton, cited, p. 85). Callinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to single-issue campaigns and then to social democracy’. In sum then, while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation, such as the historical aspects of Foucault's work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson (not to mention the giant figure of Habermas), Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’, for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base, and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it. So far so good; or one might almost say, so unproblematic. Callinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees, with justice, as a trahison des clercs . Thus far there is something almost conventional about the book's stance. It is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist, critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism (if not the evidence of late capitalism's corruption and decay). But this is not the argument's main thrust; and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character. ‘Elusive’ isn't quite the word, however. It is more a matter of approaching the book's arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees. For the concomitant of Callinicos' critique of postmodernism is not, as it would be in half a hundred other cases, the defence of modernism. For one thing, Callinicos goes out of his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read, not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism, but an instance of a Modernist-type response. Thus: ‘poststructuralism […$ the philosophical expression of Modernism, whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’(p. 6); Nietzsche's ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’(p. 67). Callinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti in respect of Carl Schmitt, that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism as if its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’(p. 48). The point is that for Callinicos, Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anti-capitalism: that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition, described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of pre-capitalist values’(cited p. 67). The consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anti-capitalism, and as such one-sided and vulnerable. The principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper, and indeed of Nietzsche himself is, for Callinicos, their aestheticism. It is as well to be clear on this. Callinicos' defence of classical Marxism, of historical materialism, is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left. This defence of Marxism carries over, however, to a critique of Modernism itself: not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him, and therefore to Modernism itself, that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains in nuce the form of understanding proper to the world itself (p. 66). In the end, that is, Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but, following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived, against Modernism itself. Drawing largely on the Marshall Berman/Perry Anderson debate, and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity, itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation, Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial in respect of the fact of this last. Weber's conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is, I think, seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art. Both are then held to be deficient relative to Marx's conception of a ‘mode of production’within which differentiation can be understood, made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality. It is in connection with this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment. From his point of view, Modernism as a sub-species of romantic anti-capitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood: understood, that is, in terms of a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation and its romantic critique. Here lies the root of Callinicos, project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment; and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic. At this point Callinicos has to be careful: it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism, wandering naked except for its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism. It is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism. And Callinicos is aware of this: ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács' celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing, but decadent’?(p. 53). For fairly obvious reasons, mostly no doubt connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism (but also I suspect because of a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos' endorsement of Althusser's ‘complex totality’ against Lukács' ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties), Callinicos has to answer: No. This begins to be interesting, and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began. If I have been primarily expository hitherto (and I have been because I believe Callinicos' book to be the best on this subject that we have) I will now begin to turn to criticism; or at least to trying to ventilate that reservation which, faced by Callinicos, certainty, will not be stilled. In a sense it doesn't matter if Callinicos' defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Post-isms and -ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics. They will wither at the first frosts anyway, if they come; and if they don't… But with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche, and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’(p. 120) which is the only way ahead, something more serious is at stake. To backtrack a little, the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied: for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos' ‘No’ to Lukács. On the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács' evolutionism (to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous: crudely, if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean, as Lukács thought it did, that its art is too), and in favour of the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced (a position related to Brecht's polemic against Lukács). More empirically however, on the other hand, and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger, Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’(p. 53). This is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avant-gardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life, but to the integration of art into life. As Bürger has it: ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works. The business of the new configuration was different: art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’(cited p. 54). The ‘avant-garde’ here means, of course, constructivism, surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’. Just how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate, but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avant-gardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible. Contra Buchloh et al ., as well as Callinicos, there is nothing as far as art (as distinct from culture or politics) is concerned which will a priori privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding (don't forget: Benjamin owned a Klee). Be that as it may, these avant-gardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’. For Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’; as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. (These arguments owe much to Perry Anderson's location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as: a decrepit academicism; the presence of new technologies; and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’.) For Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’. The downside of this, so to speak, is that the defeat of October's aspirations also marks the avant-garde's defeat. ‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the avant garde. The political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avant-garde, and furthermore, through a kind of extension (since one assumes Anderson's tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avant-gardism) come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’. The end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life, and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’(pp. 60 — 1). The problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic. Callinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism; well and good. But the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience, since the death of Trotsky; or in a more apt frame of reference, since Guernica ? I will simply have to state the case dogmatically, but: this is untenable. All of Callinicos' philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime. Aside from the fact that he doesn't actually discuss it in any detail, there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avant-garde's shock value (backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamp's readymades) and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a sub-Warholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market. as if this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avant-garde's loss of critical virtue. In an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book, amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism, Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery: ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentieth-century painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists' (p. 161). The specifics aren't clear, but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say, Pollock to André, not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol. All of which says more about Callinicos, and the limits on his knowledge and interests, than it does about the work. Whither Brecht now, on the lure of the good old days; not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anti-capitalism? I shall conclude briefly. The point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways. The first response is that it doesn't matter very much. Callinicos, defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling, and the fact that he runs out of steam over post-war art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them at all. Most sociologists, economists and politicians, after all, don't get that far. The second road is however rockier; and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening, or challenging and exhilarating. Callinicos is very careful to say, in at least two places in the book, that aesthetic judgement as to the value of a work of art is at least relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds. Thus, in his discussion of Modernism relative to Lukács and Brecht: ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism, is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label. Brecht's polemic (i.e. against Lukács)[…]retains all its force today’(p. 53). And again á propos Postmodernism: ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish. Good art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’(p. 161). This magnanimity is precisely the problem. The traffic is all one way. Callinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics; politics, writ large, as embodying an ethics and a philosophy, is the active force. Thus post-Second World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’(p. 154)— allegedly because of the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism. Cause and effect: what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’. This is a language, a world view, a form of life perhaps, wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics; Bolshevism in the main case, though as Callinicos acknowledges, one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity, its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’; that is, when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’(p. 161). Art, it seems, is the perpetual recidivist, always ducking back into the aesthetic as soon as vigilant life averts its gaze. When times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in, the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avant-garde for art’(p. 157). When things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright, so too does ‘the avant-garde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’(p. 171). In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art. The individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance. But it can only be a quirk; and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed. Only once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology. But even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ rather than any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic. Of course, the whole thrust of the historic avant-garde, and particularly its celebration here, lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology; but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement. For by far the greater part, the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism. And there is no room for doubt as to which is the tail, and which the dog. Walter Benjamin once implied something rather different. Speaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’, he identifies a work's ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’. The relationship he postulates is not one-way traffic; it is dialectical. A work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’. I take this to mean that there is an equality, a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political such that an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim. The point of Benjamin's article seems to be to decentre the political, or at least to subject it to test, to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury: such that the art can, in principle, sort out the politics, and not just vice versa. It is this, in the end, which I find disquieting about Callinicos' book. Not the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals. But the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism (which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English) put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed. The critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes. (Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate? At least you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.) A requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here. There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic. But a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism. Art has to be more than an ornament, or a reinforcement. There has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics, or the relationship as well as each of its components will be inert. An unpredictable aesthetic, it could be said, is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task. If the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political, certain problems have to be faced. For example, what goes on when looking at, say, a Matisse in an art gallery. It is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov, let alone a Bouguereau. (It is a terminal problem with the race n'class n'gender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological.) But what of time spent otherwise? How to adjudicate? The problem of course goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience (though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not, or not only, a question of intensity). The relationship between, say, reading an article in Socialist Review on the bureaucracy's pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill, and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandt's nose in a late self-portrait just is open. One is not a priori more important than the other. Which is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection, or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison. The information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt. But the way Rembrandt's nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy. Which is to say, the political commentary is a form of writing. Or, to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days, of thought. And it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen. Which latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society. Thought and organisation, or aesthetics and politics, must circle each other warily, the one never letting the other out of its sight. The abyss which all this opens up is, perhaps, terrifying before it is ‘depressing’. I have mentioned Walter Benjamin here. Callinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms. For Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility, and that alone, which remainders melancholy and irony — that is to say, Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life. It is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument, however, that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof. One could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live, rather than what teleology to adopt; or at least that the latter does not sort the former out. Benjamin remarked, tellingly, that it is less a question of what a man's beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him. This is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one. Callinicos, in his haste to counter aestheticism, reduces the aesthetic. He has to. Yet the aesthetic will not be reduced. It is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere: but an ‘as if ’, no less substantial than the as if of revolution itself. Value, you say? Pushkin eating cherries before a duel; Lenin working day in day out on Iskra; one sentence or a newspaper (the point is of course, not one without the other); Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side. For revolutions may occur, but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life. As to truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless be beautiful, though it need not be. Certain kinds of one-way traffic, certain kinds of one-way street, are in the end not hard to negotiate. Their avoidance may be more difficult by far. And there is always the possibility — the necessity?— that beauty can be its own truth. Like taking poison on the border."
ACA ACA-B2K-004 2.19 "ERNST EQUATION FOR COLLIDING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES The solutions being considered here for colliding plane waves all have a pair of commuting Killing vectors that are assumed to exist globally. It may therefore be expected that the solutions obtained may be related to known cylindrically symmetric solutions, or to stationary axisymmetric solutions, which similarly have a pair of Killing vectors. Such a relation was first pointed out by Kinnersley (1975), and by Fisher (1980). The exact relation between these solutions has been established more recently by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), and Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1985 a ), and exploited by these authors and their colleagues. In this chapter we will present an analysis of the colliding wave problem using a method that has become familiar in the study of stationary axisymmetric space-times. In this case the field is described in terms of a complex potential function that is referred to as the Ernst potential (see Ernst 1968 a ). This approach leads directly to various methods for generating further exact solutions. A derivation of the Ernst equation First it may be recalled that, of the vacuum field equations (6.22a-f) considered in previous chapters,(6.22a) may immediately be integrated to give ,(11.1) and (6.22d, e) are integrability conditions for the remaining equations. Attention is thus focused on these main equations for the metric functions  and . It is now appropriate to consider a different combination of these functions, by putting  (11.2) or, inversely . (11.3) This modifies the form of the line element (6.20), which now becomes . (11.4) It is also convenient to introduce the complex function . (11.5) With this, the line element (11.4) can be written in the form  (11.6) and the two main equations (6.22d, e) can be written as the single complex equation  (11.7) It may be seen that this is in fact Ernst's equation, which can be written in the coordinate-invariant form  (11.8) where  is the square of the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field which, in this case, is a function of the two (null) coordinates only. Similarly, v2 is the 3+1-dimensional Laplacian operator (or the generalized d'Alembertian) given by . (11.9) Using the above notation, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor given by (6.23) can be written as  (11 10) When considering Ernst's equation, it is frequently found to be useful also to introduce an associated function Ε, defined by  (11.11) With this, the line element (11.4) or (11.6) can be written in the alternative form  (11.12) and the main equations (6.22d, e), or alternatively (11.7), become . (11.13) This is the alternative form of the Ernst equation and may be rewritten in the coordinate-invariant form . (11.14) Using this function, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor (11.10) can be written as  (11.1) The problem now involves finding appropriate solutions of (11.7) or (11.13). These equations, however, contain the derivatives of U , and hence they depend on the arbitrary functions f(u) and g(v) that are specified by the incoming waves. This apparently explicit dependence on initial conditions may in fact be removed by adapting the coordinate system of Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Here we again use (10.9–12) and put  (11.16) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting . (11.17) In this coordinate system, equation (11.7) takes the more familiar explicit form of Ernst's equation:(11.18) and (11.13) similarly becomes  (11.19) The intermediate steps in the derivation of these equations may be deduced from (16.6) and (16.11). See also (12.30–31). It may be noticed that, in this case, the solution of these equations immediately determines some of the metric functions. This is in marked contrast to their application in stationary axisymmetric space-times, where the Ernst equation only determines potentials for the fields. The original metric functions, as considered in previous chapters, are now given by  (11.20) Boundary conditions When looking for solutions of the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetric space-times, it is appropriate to require that solutions be asymptotically flat. However, for colliding plane waves very different boundary conditions apply. For colliding plane waves it is necessary to choose Z or Ε, and hence V and W , such that the solution of (6.22b, c, f) for M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. For vacuum solutions, it is appropriate to use (7.8) and equations (7.9) may then be written in the form . To ensure that the boundary conditions are satisfied, it is then essential that the solution of these equations should include the necessary components (7.10). In this approach, solutions in the interaction region for  or  are related to the functions  and , and hence S may be obtained as a function of f and g . The boundary conditions described in Chapter 7 may then be considered to place restrictions on the structure of these functions, which characterize the approaching waves. In practice, these boundary conditions are difficult to apply, basically because the condition that M be continuous is only indirectly applied to the functions V and W , or Z , or E , that feature in the main equations. It is therefore often convenient to apply the boundary condition in the form (7.15) or (7.16). Writing , this becomes  This form is particularly convenient when , which occurs when impulsive waves are present. The boundary conditions in this limited case only, have been discussed by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ). In terms of the functions f and g , the conditions (11.22) become  where k 1 and k 2 must satisfy the inequalities (7.13). Alternatively, writing , the boundary conditions require that   which, in terms of the functions f and g become  (11.26) Finally, it is convenient to express the boundary conditions in terms of the variables t and z . These become, for ,(11.27) where k 1 and k 2 satisfy (7.13). Colinear solutions In the next chapter, the approach described above will be used to derive new solutions for colliding gravitational waves whose polarization vectors are not aligned. Such solutions essentially have W non-zero, and hence Z and Ε are complex. However, before moving on to consider such cases, it is appropriate first to review the colinear solutions described in previous chapters. These solutions have Z and Ε real. (i)The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971), discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 8.2, which describes the collision of aligned impulsive gravitational waves, is given by . (11.28) In this case  and . It may be observed that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times,(11.28) is the Ernst potential which leads to the Schwarzschild solution. (ii)The Szekeres (1972) class of solutions, described in Chapter 9, is given by . (11.29) In this case  and , with  for  and . (iii)The ‘solution’ of Stoyanov (1979) given by (10.24) uses . (11.30) In Section 10.2 it has been argued that this solution must be considered to be unphysical on its own, but it may be included as a factor in more general solutions. It does not satisfy the boundary conditions (11.26). (iv)The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 a ) and Griffiths (1987), which is described in Section 10.3, is characterized by  where  (11.31) In this case  and , where  and .

It is not difficult to see how further solutions of this type can be generated."
ACA ACA-CTY-005 -9.98 "Foucault's Phantasms It is in the work of Michel Foucault that we find the most unrelenting offensive against historicist theories of history. But Foucault at least can hardly be accused of neglecting history as such. The demise of Althusserianism has meant that the extent to which subsequent writers, such as Foucault or even Derrida, continued to work within the problematic that his work had established, has tended to be overlooked. It was Althusser who, after Sartre, problematized the very concept of history and laid the basis for much subsequent theoretical investigation. In the post-Althusserian context of today it is nevertheless somewhat startling to find the Althusser of Reading Capital citing his debt to Foucault (along with Bachelard, Cavaillès, and Canguilhem) as one of our masters in reading learned works'. perhaps even more unexpected, in the light of the fact that a popular British Marxist position on Althusser is that he simply turned history into theory, is the choice of Foucault's Madness and Civilization (’ that great work') and The Birth of the Clinic as examples of the kind of history, focused on the necessity of the production of a concept, that he was advocating. In certain respects Foucault always remained close to the general positions from which Althusser worked, particularly in relation to the influence of Bachelard and his scepticism towards progressivist and homogeneous histories. All were concerned to establish the possibility of discontinuity in a history, as Althusser described it, no longer‘steeped in the ideology of the philosophy of the Enlightenment, i.e. in a teleological and therefore idealist rationalism’. But whereas Althusser followed Bachelard's and Cavaillès' preoccupation with the formal systems of the pure sciences and set theory, Foucault rather pursued Canguilhem's focus on the medical and biological sciences, which emphasized their cultural frame and the historical and institutional (both discursive and non-discursive) conditions of their emergence which, according to Canguilhem, ‘chronicle-history’ neglected. From Bachelard and Canguilhem, Foucault derived his emphasis on the history of science as an epistemological study of the formation of concepts, a process of separation and discrimination which defines both the object and the problem that is  being made intelligible. For Canguilhem the history of a concept will have its own specific temporality, demonstrating less a process of epistemological self-correction as in the pure sciences than the persistence of the problem within all the contradictory solutions and ideological values that have been given to it and which make up its history. This struggle is the inevitable result of disciplines which have no claim to the validation procedures of the pure sciences and involve non-discursive as well as discursive practices and forms of knowledge. Here the history of such sciences does not consist in the gradual unfolding and emergence of scientific truths, but rather of a history of ‘veridical discourses’. Truth, like historicity, is derived from particular discursive practices; it operates internally as a form of regulation, as well as being the historical product of the battle between different discursive regimes. Foucault's contribution was to adapt this type of analysis from the life-sciences to the human and social sciences. Typically, his history takes the form of establishing a concept of something that chronological history would assume had no history, for example, madness, or sexuality. In relation to the almost antithetical Marxist positions of Sartre and Althusser, Foucault does not, however, simply follow the latter rather than the former: he articulates through a historical perspective the problems that their work encountered and attempts to produce a new method of historical enquiry — though not a general theory of history as such — that is both theoretically coherent and politically effective with respect to the particular problems under examination. That History and Marxism as such are casualties of this process is one obvious reason why attacks upon Foucault have been particularly virulent. Foucault objects to historicism and Western humanism to the extent that they assume a continuous development, progress, and global totalization. To this he adds his own more individual list of suspect conceptual categories: the subject, class, ideology, repression, the science/non-science distinction, as well as any general theory of society, causality, or of history itself. It is interesting that despite this some writers are still prepared nevertheless to claim Foucault as a Marxist — perhaps less an indication of his Marxism than of his discursive power and the lack of alternatives within Marxism today. Foucault emphasizes that his work does not lay claim to universal or general categories, nor is it even homogeneous, a presupposition that, as he has shown, has less to do with the work as such than the critical construction of its ‘author’. Nevertheless we can say at least that his preoccupation with history has been consistent throughout: the articulation of repressed history in Madness and Civilization (1961), the historicity of history in The Order of Things (1966), the epistemic mutation of history and the theoretical difficulties of historiography in The Archaeology of knowledge (1969), and the attempt to write a different kind of history, ‘genealogy’, that demonstrates the emergence of new forms of  power in Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976–84) Like many of those discussed in this book, Foucault endorses the ethico-political project of establishing forms of knowledge that do not simply turn the other into the same: as he put it in 1968, he wishes to find another politics than that which ‘since the beginning of the nineteenth century, stubbornly persists in seeing in the immense domain of practice only the epiphany of a triumphant reason, or in deciphering in it only the historico-transcendental destination of the West’. This focus on the link between the structures of knowledge and of power is increasingly related to an accompanying analysis of the discursive and technological mechanisms of repression and domination. These ethico-political concerns formed the basis of his early works on madness: as he announced in his first book,Mental Illness and Psychology (1954): One day an attempt must be made to study madness as an overall structure — madness freed and disalienated, restored in some sense to its original language. Madness and Civilization was such a study, but the assumption that it was possible simply to lift the repression and to let otherness speak for itself was questioned by Derrida in his well-known critique, ‘Cogito and the History of Madness’. It is in this context that we can see the importance of the so-called Derrida-Foucault debate which is often misrepresented, not least by Foucault himself, as a confrontation between ‘textuality’ and ‘history’. But Foucault's own subsequent work shows that it could not really be a question of choice on these terms, for the simple reason that, as he himself is at pains to point out in The Order of Things , history is itself a discursive practice: while the latter cannot be simply equated with the textual, it cannot be crudely opposed to it either. The dispute between Derrida and Foucault was less a question of text versus history than an argument about history itself. Derrida focuses on Foucault's claim that in Madness and Civilization he is writing a history of the Other. His critique centres on two related problems: in the first place if, as Foucault argues, the expulsion of madness by reason constitutes the possibility of history as such, so that this gesture of exclusion produces the fundamental structure of historicity, then the ‘classical’ moment of this proscription that he describes must be an example rather than an originary moment. In the second place, if reason is defined by its elimination of madness, and if history is a rational concept, the question then follows, how can you write a history of madness? Derrida comments: ‘It is the meaning of ‘’ history’or archia that should have been questioned first, perhaps'. Implicitly he is criticizing Foucault's understanding of the relation of the same to the other which posits madness as outside the sphere of reason. To regard the latter as systematically oppressing madness and  forcing it to the margins — to literature, or the hospital — is simply to repeat, in reverse, the very structure that is being criticized. Derrida contends that if madness is constituted as madness, as other, by reason, then this means that reason is itself defined through it and therefore already contains and depends upon it. Madness cannot be considered to exist outside the historical conditions of its production — and could never therefore be ‘restored…to its original language’ as Foucault hopes. The problem for Foucault is that this argument involves more than just madness as such, for it really amounts to a questioning of the very possibility of critique. In his early work we can see that Foucault's position involves a remarkable development of Althusser's hints that art can function as a privileged category that provides an ‘internal distance’ from ideology by relating histories, writing reports. Something of the same special place of ‘retreat’ for art, especially literature and painting, is to be found in Foucault. David Carroll has recently emphasized the significance of, a transgressive aesthetics or poetics of self-reflexivity' in his work. Such self-reflexivity, far from involving a turning inwards as is so often generally supposed, comprises rather an edge or void from which a critical perspective can be opened up: a ‘thinking of the outside’. So madness, or certain radical forms of writing, such as that of Sade, Bataille, Blanchot or Roussel, by transgressing the limits of order and turning back to reflect upon it, enable a space from which a critique can be made. This self-reflexivity operates at the limit of reason or history, eluding even the structure of the epistemes . In this schema, Foucault is therefore proposing a fundamental, enabling separation between writing and history. But after Derrida's essay, Foucault abandoned his claims that certain forms of literature could effect such a critical, reflective detachment. This led to two problems: is there then any space from which a critique can be established? and how does Foucault reformulate the relation of writing to history? In his subsequent work, the connection between the two would remain profoundly equivocal. The seriousness of Derrida's intervention can be discerned from Foucault's subsequent repudiation of the central thesis of Madness and Civilization and the change of direction that his work took thereafter. This is apparent from his rethinking of the ‘age-old distinction between the Same and the Other’. While he retained his criticisms of rationality, Foucault substituted the idea of an otherness at work within reason for that of a repressed alterity existing outside or beyond it. If madness or the other is always inside, then this means that it is always already a part of reason or the same; but it will also be exactly the element that reason is unable to comprehend, and will therefore work disruptively. This reformulation shows why it was necessary for Foucault to free himself from what he later termed ‘the repressive hypothesis’ of liberation. It also provides the context in which to consider both the claim that for the later Foucault knowledge is absolutely determined, leaving him in the impossible situation of requiring something  outside this for any prospect of critique, as well as the question of exactly how power and resistance are interdependent and to what extent they are separable. Any answer to these problems must take Foucault's own resituating of the dialectic of the same and the other into account. Even so, it is not at all obvious how he relocates writing in relation to the history to which it had until then been opposed. If it had previously operated critically outside history's limits, offering the only available possibility of critical distance, how might writing work transgressively within it? II DIFFERENTIATED HISTORIES In The Order of Things , published three years after Derrida's critique, Foucault re-examines the links between Enlightenment rationality and history and poses the questions about the latter which Derrida had suggested that Foucault's work invites. In the Preface he resituated his earlier formulations as follows: The history of madness would be the history of the Other — of that which, for a given culture, is at once interior and foreign, therefore to be excluded (so as to exorcise the interior danger) but by being shut away (in order to reduce its otherness); whereas the history of the order imposed on things would be the history of the Same — of that which, for a given culture, is both dispersed and related, therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities. (xxiv) Foucault thus modifies his argument that reason simply excluded madness and initiated the possibility of history by suggesting instead that the histories of the Other and of the Same are necessarily implicated within each other. But at the same time he refuses Derrida's equation of historicity with difference as such, instead reformulating his former thesis so that now history itself takes part in the epistemic shifts that he traces. Initially Foucault argues that the stasis of what he calls the ‘Classical Order’ gave way to ‘History’— which took over both as the form of knowledge and as the fundamental mode of being for empirical phenomena. By the end of The Order of Things , however, he revises this somewhat conventional thesis to suggest that what was involved was not so much a move from a static to a historical view of things as the break-up of a common, unified historical time-scheme in which every phenomenon had had its place in the same space and chronology. In place of a unity of time came the notion of discrete temporalities, with a recognition of a historicity proper to each discipline or area of knowledge. Instead of a great historical narrative common to ill, everything now had its own chronology and its own history. The effect of this was to dehistoricize man himself. Whereas formerly he had been the subject of history, taking pride of place in God's historical scheme from creation onwards, now ‘the human being no longer has any history: or rather, since he speaks, works, and lives, he finds himself interwoven in his own being with histories that are neither subordinate to him nor homogeneous with him’(368 — 9). Man was no longer the measure of all things. Two possibilities were developed to deal with man's new homelessness in the world, his exposure, as Foucault puts it, to the finitude of the event, which attempted to draw all these heterogeneous histories together again: either men sought for some fundamental law through which a new general history could be constituted, or historicity as such was defined in terms of‘man’— whether as progress, economic laws, or cultural totalities. The creation of man as centre was effected by defining him against other, now marginalized groups, such as women, the mad, or, we would add, the allegedly sub-human ‘native’. This move formed the basis for the human sciences which, through their organization around the figure of man, once more brought about a unity to History. We shall examine the relation of this new humanism to the history of Western colonialism in a later chapter: it is not a question that Foucault himself elaborates in the course of what is claimed to be an, ethnology of Western culture'. Rather he points to the theoretical paradox involved, namely that the human sciences' very emphasis on historicity as a mode of being was equally applicable to themselves as forms of knowledge, and inevitably destroyed any attempt to formulate universal laws comparable to those of the natural sciences. Here we can see a rather different perspective on the human alienation which Lukács describes; in Foucault's account, Marxism's attempt to reproduce the totality in itself falls within the terms of his argument by which totalizing theories of history are based on an anxiety derived from the break-up of its unity. Marxism's claim to the status of a science proper thus functions as a device to avoid the historicity through which it accounts for other phenomena . The Order of Things by contrast points to the emergence of historicity as a mode of understanding, and argues that ‘History’, both as a form of knowledge and as the primary state of being of empirical phenomena — broadly speaking, the assumption of all Marxisms —is itself a historical phenomenon . This means that history cannot provide an unquestionable ground for knowledge, and that historicity cannot claim an a priori privilege as the fundamental mode of being either. As the two ‘counter-sciences’ ethnology and psychoanalysis have suggested, history is simply one possible discursive form of understanding — even if its problematic of temporality spills over into many others. In making this argument, however, Foucault is not concerned to dispense with history — rather to make history itself an object of historical investigation and to question its presuppositions. In particular, he challenges Hegel's equation in the Phenomenology of the evolution of history with the developing consciousness of man himself. Although this has been particularly influential for many forms of Western Marxism, it also represents a deviation from Marx's original claim that history is the effect of material  conditions rather than of human consciousness. In this way Foucault could be said to be returning to Marx in removing the subject from the centre of history, were it not for the fact that he dispenses with the consolations of Marx's historicism also. In this situation he asks, how do we come to terms with the event, with continuities and discontinuities, in short with history as difference and not just the story of sameness? Foucault adopts a strategy, obviously indebted to Bachelard, designed to restore the otherness that History by definition must disallow: he produces an account of epistemic shifts, with prior epistemes presented as altogether estranged from the present. In order to come to terms with the past, the initial gesture must be to confront its strangeness, rather than to seek for similarities and continuities so that it can be equated with the present and thus, in effect, dehistoricized. Following Althusser's suggestion that a historical problematic might be altogether invisible even to experiencing subjects, in The Order of Things Foucault analyses what he provocatively calls ‘the historical a priori ’ according to which the knowledges of grammar, natural history and wealth, and their epistemic replacements, philology, biology, and political economy, were structured. But as with Althusser's modes of production, so Foucault's attempt to elaborate a ‘positive unconscious ’ of knowledge was criticized by Sartre, and subsequently by many others, for being unable to give any account of change and for implying a total discontinuity between periods. The objection that Foucault neglects history because he does not attempt to give reasons why the epistemic shifts he describes occurred is perhaps inevitable but also begs the question: for conventional historiography has in general done nothing but account for such shifts — which has meant that it has consistently failed to recognize alterity and incommensurability in its insistent search for continuities with the past. Without history as a form of mediation the differences return as the problem, and it was this which, according to Foucault,The Order of Things was really trying to address. Here we might recall Derrida's criticism of Levinas's history ‘as a blinding to the other, and as the laborious procession of the same’. In the face of a history which obscures such discontinuities, the first stage for Foucault, therefore, is to defamiliarize it by reconstituting it without the mythology of a continuous History which has turned difference into identity. It is often assumed that Foucault is simply the philosopher of discontinuity, merely substituting it where previously there had been continuity; but the discontinuous is emphasized only because so much stress is normally placed on the continuous. It is not just a question of exchanging one for the other. This has a methodological implication as well: all too often it is assumed that Foucault's stress on disruption can be taken as equivalent to randomness, as we have seen with Perry Anderson. However, it is more helpful to consider it in the context of Canguilhem, who emphasized that the life sciences, like the natural sciences, require their own specific mode of history; they show that historical method itself must be  heterogeneous, in the sense that there is no single method applicable to the whole range of different histories. Even the history of discontinuities is itself impermanent and discontinuous. If certain forms of history stress continuity, try to account for change, the history of science by contrast must be disjointed, for it is made up of a series of corrections in which the errors of the past have to be simply discarded. Foucault, as we have seen, is also criticized on the grounds that he cannot give a cause for the shifts he describes, but this criticism itself begs the question insofar as it assumes a certain kind of history, which itself presupposes that there was a cause in the sense of a single uniform causality, rather than a disconnectedness in the scientific mode. In the context of conventional historiography, Foucault argues that the point is to analyse the different kinds of transformation, the complex ‘play of dependencies’, links and redistributions, rather than to provide yet another account of change, succession and its causes. The Order of Things , although in many ways Foucault's most influential work, remains, however, an oddity in certain respects: first, that in arguing for an a priori common to a (limited) number of knowledges, Foucault at times seems to be advocating a structural key between different levels within the episteme , thus restoring the form of the essential section so criticized by Althusser. Foucault has even been accused of returning, in this work, to the concept of a totality in the episteme ; it has certainly been somewhat hastily assumed that the latter can be appropriated more or less as a new way of describing a historical ‘period’. This fails to recognize, however, the extent to which it articulates only the structure of certain specific forms of knowledge rather than some single overarching principle. The constant emphasis on its being the Western episteme suggests immediate problems for any assumption that it constitutes a totality. The episteme rather delineates what Foucault calls a ‘cluster of transformations’; these, he suggests, enable the substitution of ‘differentiated analyses for the themes of a totalising history: They allow us to describe, as the episteme of a period, not the sum of its knowledge, nor the general style of its research, but the deviation, distances, the oppositions, the differences, the relations of its multiple scientific discourses: the epistemic is not a sort of grand underlying theory , it is a space of dispersion , it is an open field of relationships and no doubt indefinitely specifiable . They allow us furthermore to describe not the great history which would carry along all the sciences in a single trajectory, but the types of history — that is to say, of retentivity and transformation — which characterize different discourses…the episteme is not a slice of history common to all the sciences: it is a simultaneous play of specific remanences . finally they allow us to situate the different thresholds in their respective place: for nothing proves in advance…that their chronology is the same for all types of discourse… The episteme is not a general stage of reason, it is a complex relationship of successive displacements. This is very different from the integral paradigms of Thomas Kuhn to which Foucault's epistemes are sometimes compared. But if The Order of Things is thus concerned to analyse ‘ensembles of discourses’ that do not form a totality, it does not focus on the ways in which such forms of knowledges relate to the institutions in which and through which they are produced. In The Archaeology of knowledge Foucault corrects this by addressing the difficulties of making knowledges intelligible as a part of their institutional, social and political practices. III ARCHAEOLOGY Foucault's distrust of conventional forms of history, as we have seen, is a consistent thread in his project, as is his insistence that his historical method is limited to addressing specific problems — often comparable to those posed by the social sciences — to historical documents and practices in order to make them intelligible. Only once, however, does he devote a whole book to the problem of historical methodology. In The Archaeology of knowledge he develops his suggestion in The Order of Things that an epistemological mutation is taking place today with regard to the very concept and methodology of history. The book is both an account of and an intervention in that process, veering between the descriptive and the prescriptive. It begins by delineating the epistemological shift: the old order could be termed ‘History’, a continuous and chronological historiography, including Hegelianism and related forms of Marxism, with its philosophies of history, its assumptions of a rational, progressive and teleological historical development, its desire to discover a meaning in history, its questioning of the relativity of historical knowledge, and its use of categories such as tradition, the history of ideas, the oeuvre , the author and the book. Against this Foucault contrasts the work of the Annales school which analyses long continuities in certain social forms: The old questions of the traditional analysis (What link should be made between disparate events? Flow can a causal succession be established between them? What continuity or overall significance do they possess? Is it possible to define a totality, or must one be content with reconstituting connections?) are now being replaced by questions of another type: which strata should be isolated from others? What types of series should be established? What criteria of periodisation should be adopted for each of them? What system of relations (hierarchy, dominance, stratification, univocal determination, circular causality) may be established between them? What series of series may be established? And in what large-scale chronological table may distinct series of events be determined? (3 — 4) Foucault notes that, at the same time as the Annales school and others were constructing a history according to the long durée , in the history of science, philosophy, and literature, attention was turning in exactly the opposite direction, that is away from vast unities towards phenomena of rupture, discontinuity, displacement and transformation, towards different temporalities as well as architectonic unities. Here he instances in particular the work of Bachelard, Canguilhem, Serres, Guéroult, and Althusser. He argues that, given the proliferation of both discontinuities and long periods, the problem is now to constitute the series, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series. In other words, rather than set these antithetical approaches against each other as one might have expected, Foucault suggests that they are part of the same mutation. Foucault characterizes this epistemic shift in terms of the difference between what he calls ‘total’ and ‘general’history, or, History and archaeology. He explains this as follows. Total, or, elsewhere, global, history assumes a spatio-temporal continuity between all phenomena, and a certain homogeneity between them insofar as they all express the same form of historicity — Althusser's essential section — whereas in general history the problem is precisely to determine the relation between different series: whereas a total history draws everything together according to a single principle, a general history analyses the space of dispersion and heterogeneous temporalities. Total history seeks to reconstitute the overall form of a society according to some fundamental principle, law, or form, be it metaphysical or material, while general history despite its name is by no means concerned to produce a general theory of history, nor even a cohesive or comprehensive view, but rather to conduct a historical investigation according to particular problems, opening up a field ‘in which one could describe the singularity of practices, the play of their relations’. Foucault specifies the difference between them by contrasting their relation to the document: the historians of total history have been engaged above all in the interpretation of documents, attempting to reconstitute the past, to give it an inner meaning (always available only to the historian), to recover a voice and allow it to speak. The historians of a general history, on the other hand, reject interpretation as such in favour of making the evidence of documents intelligible by posing questions to them, constituting through such questions what counts as the series of historical events, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series, or what rules operated for particular discursive practices. This stress on intelligibility is a useful corrective to the widespread current assumption — for which Foucault himself is also partly responsible — that history is just another form of interpretation. Unexpectedly, perhaps, Foucault traces the beginnings of this epistemic mutation in the thinking of history to Marx. This implies a challenge that contemporary Marxism has yet to address. As we have seen, for some  Foucault can apparently be dismissed with ease as merely the philosopher of discontinuity, a description which is hardly adequate; for others, criticism takes the form that he simply relativizes history, but this is really no better, for history is itself a mode of demonstrating the relativity, temporariness, and temporality of phenomena. Unless it is possible to prove the identification of History with Truth, as Sartre tried to do, then the claim that a single univocal History is not relative only works by removing all other elements in the set to which it could be compared, thus making a set of one. Effectively, however, all this does is to turn all history into a single event — which, paradoxically, dehistoricizes it. What has not been adequately considered is Foucault's characterization of an epistemological shift within the theorization of history itself. He suggests not only that it begins with Marx but that he himself forms part of this mutation, which means that, according to his argument, in order to dismiss him you would have to dismiss Marx also. Foucault thus does not merely set up an alternative history, but contends that that alternative is part of a displacement that is in the process of replacing the history that preceded it. It is therefore necessary to address not only his theoretical and methodological but also his historical arguments — something that his critics have singularly failed to do. The Archaeology of Knowledge thus analyses the shift in historiography of which Foucault himself is the most powerful contemporary representative. As epistemic breaks go, however, it seems to be a slow one: Foucault attributes its hesitancy to a fundamental reluctance to think difference rather than the reassuring form of the identical: it is, he comments, ‘as if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own thought’. Here we encounter the continuing dominance of the philosophy of the subject, which, according to Foucault, was specifically introduced in order to provide a ‘shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness’ against the intrusion of heterogeneity. Continuous history and the subject are thus dependent on each other. Instead of centring his analyses on the knowledge derived from the experience of the subject, Foucault investigates the conditions of emergence of the subject as the basis of knowledge; he argues that at the same time as it was widely proposed as the one saving good of human civilization it also facilitated a more sinister operation. Just as History involved the legitimation as knowledge of certain forms of political power, so the production of the subject by the human sciences as an object of knowledge also enabled a new form of political control: ‘The individual is not a pre-given entity which is seized on by the exercise of power. The individual, with his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies’. In Discipline and Punish Foucault demonstrates how the individual is constituted through specific technologies of power; in the History of Sexuality , he shows the extent to which the human sciences, including medicine and the practice of psychoanalysis, facilitated the extension of control beyond the limits of the body in the construction of the inner realms of subjectivity, consciousness and experience. Foucault argues that a whole series of movements since the nineteenth century, including various anthropologizing Marxisms, have developed complicitly with this so as to preserve the sovereignty of the subject against Marx's and others' decentrings: positivism, the Hegelian Marxism of Lukács, the Marxist humanism of Sartre, as well as various theories of cultural totalities such as that of the Frankfurt School. Dispensing with the subject necessarily also means the end of the use of the category of ideology; in this context Foucault's later work counters Althusser's influential essay on ideological state apparatuses. Many of those now hostile to Althusser continue to endorse this essay, which offers a theory of institutional power dependent on the categories of the subject and ideology. Foucault is critical of such a theory not just because it is based on a science/non-science distinction which for him is simply the product of a particular discursive formation which claims access to the real, rather than involving any epistemological questions of truth or objectivity, but also because it produces the notion of ideology as a secondary mediation (as in Althusser's interpellation) in an inside/outside structure between the determinants of power and the individual subject. For Foucault, the tendency of theories of ideology to entrammel themselves in the categories of psychoanalysis, even with the eternal in Althusser's case, means that they themselves begin to utilize the very procedures of individuation that they ought to have been analysing. The questions of the subject and of ideology raise as their corollary the problem of what position of enunciation the historian can claim in relation to his or her own work. Foucault is particularly critical of the appropriating structure of totalization, Marxist or otherwise, insofar as it implies the superiority of the theorist who produces the totalization of knowledge; in the same way, he distrusts the use of history as an encompassing framework because it works as a power structure that enables the expropriation and control of the past according to the perspective and truth of the present. It elides the fact that the historian will always also be historically located and therefore cannot be in a position to produce a final totalization, a dialectical situation anticipated by Sartre. Foucault argues that just as there can be no general theory of history, but only particular answers to particular questions which make individual practices intelligible, so the intellectual can best hope to be specific rather than universal (universal in the sense of proposing transcendent values, systems, totalities, narratives or teleologies). This does not mean that the intellectual therefore nihilistically celebrates dispersion, fragmentation or relativity: rather she or he is the person who, facing such dispersion but without conceding to the nostalgic desire for totalization, poses the questions and constitutes the series and continuities for analysis — and thus for transformation — while attempting to respect its heterogeneity. This suggests why, contrary to the way in which certain commentators tend to represent them, it is clear that for Foucault, as for Lyotard or Derrida, total fragmentation would be as counter-productive — and as impossible — as total synthesis. As Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak puts it: ‘Theoretical descriptions cannot produce universals. They can only ever produce provisional generalizations, even as the theorist realizes the crucial importance of their persistent production’. Such arguments will have no pretensions, by definition, to knowledge-claims that affect to rise above the historical conditions in which they are made. IV HISTORY AND THE EVENT Despite his programmatic emphasis in the Archaeology on the discursive formation as a means of making intelligible those knowledges that are formulated through their institutional components, Foucault turned away from this kind of historical enquiry because it was too ‘clean, conceptually aseptic’— in other words, too apolitical. Foucault therefore abandons analysis of epistemes for the more Nietzschean ‘genealogy’, which allows him to articulate conflict in terms of differentiated histories with their own conceptual specificities and their own times, while retaining the possibility of the formulation of aims and intentions: I would call genealogy…a form of history which can account for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects etc., without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history. Genealogy develops the possibility broached in the Archaeology that in a general history different significances can be accorded to events, depending on‘their correlation with other previous or simultaneous events, discursive or not’. Here it is the problem the historian poses that determines what constitutes an event and what status it has. Foucault's genealogy means that by asking a question, posing a problem, you set up a generality against which you constitute events and arrange them in a series. The construction of that generality does not pretend to be the only possible one — the same event could operate in all sorts of different ways in different series, temporalities, which would mean that, strictly speaking, it was no longer the same event, for it would have been dispersed in their different rarefactions. This is not supposed to suggest that events cannot be said to occur straightforwardly in the real but rather that when set up in any series, narrative, or history they are constructed as such events retrospectively by the historian. If all history attempts to conceptualize the event, to wean it from its finitude, then Foucault like many of his contemporaries is concerned to  respect its singularity. In the essay ‘Theatum philosophicum’(1970), written shortly after the Archaeology , Foucault attempts to avoid the snares of the problem of the relation of the event to the totality, or the particular to the general, that beset both Sartre and Althusser, by arguing that the event as event is only constituted through its repetition in thought as a ‘phantasm’: ‘it makes the event indefinite so that it repeats itself as a singular universal’. This argument, which Foucault derives from Deleuze, although at the same time he tellingly invokes Sartre's theoretical formulation designed to solve exactly the same problem, provides a way of avoiding the incommensurability of the relation of the event to the concept by allowing ‘the disjunctive affirmation of both’— thus solving the problem that the concept, as a part of the language of generality, will inevitably travesty the event's singularity: Logique du sens causes us to reflect on matters that philosophy has neglected for many centuries: the event (assimilated in a concept, from which we vainly attempted to extract it in the form of a fact , verifying a proposition, of actual experience , a modality of the subject, of concreteness , the empirical content of history); and the phantasm (reduced in the name of reality and situated at the extremity, the pathological pole, of a normative sequence: perception-image-memory-illusion). After all, what most urgently needs thought in this century, if not the event and the phantasm? Well, it might be hard to see it as that important. Foucault's gesture, however, marks the radical scope of such an anti-essentialist project which exploits Plato's admission that there can not only be a good copy but also a bad one (phantasma)— characteristic of the secondary representations of the poets. Deleuze reverses Plato by validating this simulacrum of the good copy on the grounds that, precisely because it is a bad copy, it breaks down all adequation between copy and model, appearance and essence, event and Idea. As plato realized, it is dangerous because its effect is to dethrone the Idea from its position of Truth. Moreover, because the bad copy by definition cannot claim to be copying anything but itself, it creates its ‘original’ retroactively, so that the copy precedes the original in a ghostly originary repetition. Descombes describes a comparable paradoxical structure in his account of ‘originary delay’: a first event cannot be the first event if it is the only event; it cannot be said to be a first until it is followed by a second, which then retrospectively constitutes it as the first — which means that its firstness hovers over it as its meaning without being identifiable with it as such. Thus, the phantasm, rather than constituting the event, hovers over its surface like a cloud, as an effect of meaning not identifiable with anything in the event as such. Deleuze's best-known example of how this works is the battle: ‘Where’’, he asks, ‘is the battle? What we call a battle consists of a vast, heterogeneous array of individual actions in the field — fighting, firing, charging, wounding — none of which constitutes ‘the battle’ as such. ‘The battle’ hovers over the individual actions like in incorporeal cloud, distinct from them, but at the same time making up a surface of their meaning-effect, a simulacrum that brings the event into being at the moment when language and event coincide. Foucault recognizes in Deleuze's account of events as singularities, points or intensities on a surface ready to be actualized in any particular form or meaning, the potential for pushing further his own notion of history as a genealogical series. Such genealogy works by repeating the (non) event, as an event, in thought — in a structure comparable to Freud's ‘deferred action, or ‘retroactivity’. No more than the latter does it seek to lay claim to ‘the real, or Truth as such. Foucault inflects this model by focusing on the possibility of constructing the series so as to repeat the disruption and discontinuity of the (non-original) event. In freud, the point is similarly not just the question — on which most attention gets focused — of whether the event ‘really’ happened (a good copy) or was subsequently fantasized by the experiencing subject (a bad copy), but rather that it is repeated as a disruptive event that fissures ordinary forms of psychic continuity and therefore gains analytic attention in the present. The same structure can be utilized by the historian so that the writing of history can itself become a disruptive event and consequently a form of political intervention. V FOUCAULT'S PHANTASMS If Foucault proposes the philosophy of the phantasm as a way for the historian to produce the meaning-effect of the event while still doing justice to its singularity, it also offers a way of thinking through some of the paradoxes that we have encountered in the problematic conceptualization of history. From Sartre to Foucault history has repeatedly emerged as a contradictory concept, both totalizing and detotalizing, essentialist and non-essentialist. Such contradictions can be productive: the attempt to reject historicism absolutely results either in an utter particularism or in a surreptitious return of historicism in a different form. Only an understanding that recognizes that an irresolvable tension works within the historical schema itself will be in a position to make its contradictory claims productive. This possibility is outlined by Foucault himself as early as The Order of Things . He comments: The more History attempts to transcend its own rootedness in historicity, and the greater the efforts it makes to attain, beyond the historical relativity of its origin and its choices, the sphere of universality, the more clearly it bears the marks of its historical birth, and the more evidently there appears through it the history of which it is itself a part…inversely, the more it accepts its relativity, and the more deeply it sinks into the movement it shares with what it is recounting, then the more it tends to  the slenderness of the narrative, and all the positive content it obtained for itself through the human sciences is dissipated. (371) History becomes the impossibility between this Scylla and Charybdis — in Lyotard's terms, it contains within its own project an incommensurable difference . It can only be described in terms of its organization according to an economy of logical tensions or strictures, of demands and constraints. It is, as Derrida comments, a question of showing: that history is impossible, meaningless, in the finite totality, and that it is impossible, meaningless, in the positive and actual infinity: that history keeps to the difference between totality and infinity. Thus both historicism or entirely differentiated histories are in themselves impossibilities: history will always involve a form of historicism, but a historicism that cannot be sustained. It is thus a contradictory (quasi) concept — a phantasm — in which neither the elements of totalization nor difference can be definitively achieved or dispatched. This means that history can be theorized not so much as a contradictory process but as a concept that must enact its own contradiction with itself: ‘this difference is what is called History ’. In this context, we may recall that Althusser, rather than simply criticizing the notion of history as a totality as Foucault often tended to do, argued for the rearticulation of different histories within a decentred totality, on the assumption that history cannot do without one. Was it simply incoherence on his part when he suggested that his ‘science of history’, even though it allows for differentiated histories, still demands to be considered within a general concept of history? We have seen the ways in which Sartre's Critique shows how totalization cannot work without a movement of self-transcendence, a repeated interpolation of an excess beyond the totality which paradoxically then means that the totality can no longer be a totality. Although Sartre's inability to effect self-totalization is often presented as a failure, the movement of history that he describes is increasingly enacted through his own writing. Such a shift is not immediately discernible in Foucault. His Deleuzian notion of the phantasmatic event constituted a brief attempt to reformulate the relation of the particular to the general as a problem of history. But he made little effort to develop this outside his own definitions of the genealogical method, while his shift into the problematics of power seemed to lead him into a labyrinth from which it was virtually impossible to extract himself. The philosophy of the phantasm may, however, help us to do justice to the event of Foucault himself. One of the oddities of Foucault's work is that it seems riven by an internal tension — for example, as peter Dews notes, while on the one hand Foucault lays claims to a form of objectivity in his archaeology, and eschews interpretation in favour of ‘intelligibility’, on the  other hand throughout his life he was also prone to endorse a Nietzschean insistence on the interminability of interpretation. For Dews this equivocation over the epistemological status of his own discourse is a sign of an uncontrollable oscillation: ‘the shifting perspectives of Foucault's work’, he writes, ‘do powerfully illuminate, but at the same time fall victim to, the contradictory processes which they address’. But such a self-undermining of the epistemological status of his own work is also characteristic of Lacan, and of Freud — indeed, Dews argues that this constitutes Freud's greatest strength. We might therefore wonder whether its appearance in Foucault, far from being the result of theoretical ineptitude, does not involve simulacra, or ghostly bad copies, similarly designed to undermine the claims of theoretical mastery, and to produce in his texts surface-effects of the kind of heterogeneity we might expect from someone who had contested the unifying function of ‘the author’. With respect to history, the vacillations of Foucault's writing enact the impossibility of its simultaneous finitude and infinitude, the irresolvable conflict between history as meaning and history as difference, between history as a teleology and eschatology and history as the event, as finitude and mortality. Here we once more encounter the recognition that at a conceptual level the idea of history cannot be taken further: rather it can only be addressed through a tension in the writing itself. The early opposition between writing and history which enabled a critique from an outer limit has thus been replaced by a dissension within Foucault's own discursive practice. Instead of locating the other elsewhere in the transgressive writing of literature or madness, Foucault himself becomes plato's banished poet, and enacts in his language a supplementary simulacrum of the delirium of history. As Maurice Blanchot has put it: ‘And were not his own principles more complex than his official discourse, with its striking formulations, led one to think?’ VI HISTORY AS POWER In later work Foucault veers away from his most radical philosophical insights towards an analysis of discursive and extra-discursive systems of domination and exploitation, with increasing focus on the apparently more political question of power. But perhaps this shift is not so distinct: for the interaction of power and resistance, which mimes the mutual contamination and transmutation of Freud's death-drive and pleasure principle, also operates is a simulacrum of the ungraspable, vacillating manoeuvres of Foucault's formulations of history. Whereas Foucault was inclined to remark that in retrospect he considered that all his work had been about power, it seems almost equally possible that his analyses of power constitute a continuing meditation on the phantasm. Although in no sense a general theory, Foucault's notion of power reformulates the problem of agency and determinism which had beset Sartre and many others by focusing on the  possibility of making intelligible the strategies and techniques of local operations of power without relying on the dialectic of ideology and the consciousness of subjects, or on their corollary, the assumption that power operates globally and homogeneously. The absence of the category of consciousness inevitably plays down the role of individual subjects and thus of individual agency and resistance as a result of specific acts of will. If this causes difficulties for some, Foucault's scepticism with regard to the tendency to inflate the effect of individual agency can only be compared to the position of many Marxisms in which resistance and revolution are hardly the privilege of the individual as such, but rather of collective class action. Those who forget the virtues of solidarity in order to protest against the downgrading of individual agency might recall that it has been intellectuals who have been most prone to inflate the significance of individuals — particularly intellectuals — to the same degree that their theories propose universal categories and claim universal effects. Moreover the exclusive focus on ‘resistance’ as a privileged political category is itself open to question. As with his genealogical history, Foucault's meditations on power are not themselves without problems, but reactions to them can also be too hastily dismissive, often because it is assumed that they are proposed as a general theory. For example, after the History of Sexuality much has been made of Foucault's analysis of power as a form of totalizing paranoia; but the analyses in that book, of, for example , the shift from the Catholic confession box to the confessional psychoanalytic couch, are both culturally and historically specific, and Foucault's remarks about them need to be put in the same perspective. After all, if ‘the system’ really was bent upon the form of totalizing control that according to Foucault psychoanalysis, for example, enables, it is worth recalling that psychoanalysis has never been adopted by the state as such and that its activities remain confined to a few very limited districts in a handful of prosperous cities round the world. Similarly, those who claim that Foucault removes the possibility of resistance as such miss the point: all that he downgrades is a theory of resistance centred on the individual subject as sovereign agent. He argues that to focus analysis in this way neglects the disciplinary forms and technologies through which power operates. The claim for a straightforward oppositional kind of resistance also assumes that subjects can resist from a position outside the operations of power, according to the dominant inside/outside model of conventional politics. This is the context in which to place Foucault's own recognition after Derrida's critique that he could no longer postulate madness or the other as outside, after which he maintained that the other is also always inside; he formulates the structures of power in exactly the same way, so that the forces of domination and resistance are caught up, sometimes indistinguishably, within each other. Acts of resistance may of course continue to be initiated through individual acts of will, but as for Sartre  there is no guarantee that they will produce intended effects. An awareness of this structure does not mean that strategic intervention is either useless or impossible; but it does mean that analysis of how resistance actually operates, in what conditions it succeeds or fails, needs an altogether more complex model. Foucault's account of power is thus difficult to the degree to which he argues that the exercise and resistance of power work in a disruptive rather than a dialectical relation to each other, suggesting that ‘points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network’. Where there is power, there is resistance: contrary to what is often assumed, it is the absence of resistance which is impossible. power is a two-way process. Just as the exercise of power is heterogeneous, so is resistance; Foucault's point is simply that ‘there is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary’. Resistance does not operate outside power, nor is it necessarily produced oppositionally: it is imbricated within it, the irregular term that consistently disturbs it, rebounds upon it, and which on occasions can be manipulated so as to rupture it altogether: Just as the network of power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes through apparatuses and institutions, without being exactly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of resistance traverses social stratifications and individual unities. And it is doubtless the strategic codification of these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on the institutional integration of power relationships. It is in this way that Foucault can return to the possibility of doing historical work that has political force through his notion of genealogy, which means, as he puts it, ‘that I begin my analysis from a question posed in the present’. The question enables the tactical use of historical knowledge in contemporary political situations which necessitate the posing of the question with which genealogy begins. Such politics stress the local or the specific without assuming that they constitute the starting point for a global hegemony into which they will be subsumed. Foucault does not aim to produce ‘a’ politics any more than ‘a’history. It is this factor which, perhaps above all, has enabled the critical use of Foucault's analyses of power in demarcated areas of analysis. Ironically, Foucault's most problematic ‘theory’ has generated the most successful and probing historical work among his followers. VII CODA: THE NEW HISTORICISM The relation of Foucault's politics to history leads to the question of the tactical use of Foucault himself in current forms of criticism; in addition to his extensive use by historians and sociologists, he is also associated with those movements that have become known as ‘new historicism’ and ‘cultural materialism’. The former is identified closely with Foucault, while the latter owes its allegiance to Raymond Williams, and really only amounts to a way of describing British ex-Marxists. New historicism is most concerned with the late Foucault, in particular with representations and mechanisms of power, the means through which cultural artefacts can be shown to be not passive reflectors of the history of their time but active producers of it. This charting of the circulating relations between aesthetic and other forms of production works best in those historical periods, such as the Renaissance, where there was no modern concept of Literature, thus allowing literary texts to be mapped against the political and other discourses of which they formed a part. New historicism emphasizes the way in which certain rituals and practices, for example of kingship, are equally a part of the processes and representation of power — whether at a beheading, a masque or in a poem. At the same time, it can also bring out the complex ways in which such forms of power also produce their own forms of resistance; as critics like Stephen Greenblatt demonstrate, these are not separable processes but are simultaneous effects of power. The illustration of such a double logic working at a textual level often comes to seem remarkably close to a deconstructive analysis: in the same way as Derrida or de Man could be said to be deconstructing received readings that have institutional purchase, so the new historicists shift our understanding of institutionalized historical accounts. However, the very historical focus poses the problem of agency and containment in a more immediate way that demonstrates some of the dilemmas that follow from Foucault's genealogical history. The real difficulty, as Greenblatt shows, is what status can be accorded the category of subversion or resistance: what is the historical status of the ‘subversive, elements of a text? If the process of the construction of knowledge can be shown to work against itself, this can operate because the ideas of the dominant order are not in fact threatened by alternatives which, with hindsight, may appear radical to us now. As the cultural materialists concede, subversive thoughts are not subversive until they become a practice. Can they be shown to have had historical effects? From the point of view of a radical politics, the onus on the critic, therefore, is to show the ways in which such subversions can be shown to have produced specific instances of change. Correspondingly, as Greenblatt argues, Renaissance ideas which might be subversive today are ignored in favour of‘radical’ ideas which seem to echo our own. Both groups follow Foucault to the extent that they neither propose, nor utilize, a general theory of history as such; but unlike Foucault they simply tend to shelve the whole problem so as to avoid its theoretical difficulties. So, despite the Lukácsian resonance of its name, new historicism abandons both the notion of history as a readable background to literary texts, and the Marxist dependency on reflection, in its effort to recontextualize literary texts in a more immediate way with other forms of social production. For their part, the British cultural materialists quickly adopted a name which tactfully removes the suggestion of Marxism as such. In the context of the present discussion of history, moreover, it is highly significant that traditional ‘historical materialism’ has been jettisoned in favour of the anthropological ‘cultural materialism’. The cultural materialists abandon the traditional Marxist use of history as a ground for truth in favour of bringing history into the present day in order to intervene in their own institutional and academic political context. In this case it becomes less a matter of addressing contemporary political problems than of resisting institutional power, namely those critical readings which have recently claimed cultural hegemony, and of providing instead alternative accounts which insist on heterogeneity and resistance in historical texts. An identification is then implicitly or explicitly made with parallel forms of political struggle in our own day. In other words, where yesterday's historian looked for the history of an oppressed working class, today's historian looks for marginalized groups, and those who have transgressed social norms. Whether they actually were subversive becomes irrelevant to the extent that they can now be retrieved to offer a potential that has a contemporary, that is twentieth-century, political relevance. To this extent we could say that the cultural materialists re-assert a form of reflection theory, where history has become a mirror in which contemporary political priorities have been substituted for the former certain ground of Marxist analysis. The cultural materialists are inclined to separate the self-contradictory differences isolated by the new historicists into a more conventional political paradigm of opposing classes, of hegemony and subversion. Similarly, though Foucault is often invoked, there is a marked tendency to continue to utilize theoretical categories such as ideology, consciousness and the subject. Here it is salutary to recall Foucault's scepticism with regard to the ‘perilous ease’ with which politics quickly assumes positions that provide intellectual guarantees rather than specific analyses of particular relations or transformations; he reacts in the same way to political analogies, and correspondences, or to hasty links with current political practices. To the last, Foucault himself remained suspicious of any ‘progressive politics, if that meant that it continued to be linked to a (hidden) meaning, origin, or the subject. But if the cultural materialists, unlike the more fastidious new historicists, cheerfully ignore the theoretical consequences of Foucault's work for many Marxist concepts, in other ways they are closer to him  insofar as they make clear in their work their own political priorities and commitments. Nevertheless it is worth recalling that Foucault never starts at the political, but rather begins with a contemporary problem and then addresses questions to politics about it. He argues that intellectual work need not always be measured against immediate political ends; rather the question to ask is what project is it undertaking, what problem is it analysing? It should always be possible for the intellectual to justify and to show the grounds on which any particular activity has been constituted. At the same time, it is too easy to condemn certain forms of work for being apolitical simply because they do not correspond to a certain paradigm of immediate political effectivity. Political interventions can also work according to different time scales. But if the cultural materialists tend to place a politics rather than a problem as the starting point of their enquiry, they do emphasize the deployment of specialized knowledges in the service of the popular political struggles of today. This suggests a closeness to Foucault's notion of genealogy that the more strictly academic new historicists, whose own politics remain more carefully hidden, ignore."
ACA ACA-ECV-005 0.3 "5 The Philosopher's Child Judith Hughes SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING Children have served philosophy very well. That is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice. Along with a selection from a list including women, animals, madmen, foreigners, slaves, patients and imbeciles, children have served in that great class of beings, the ‘not-men’, in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves. Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention. They have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood. Generations of philosophers have documented this process. Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come. Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood, boyhood and youth. That is the second thing to notice; the philosopher's children are boys. The fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, no doubt, the reasons for this were largely social. But the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice, though many might think this real and bad enough. Education has an end. Although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘for its own sake’, what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be. Where the end is  person- rather than role-oriented — that is, where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of, say, information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve. Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them. The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter. Education has been directed at the production of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, in short, the autonomous human being. Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species. Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all. The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others. It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy. Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction. This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself. It is also about children. WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children? There are, of course, the familiar and obvious reasons  connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too. When philosophers dismiss women as ‘not-men’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics. Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep. It would be well to know just what this entails. Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like. A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women, they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality, capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics. We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous? Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive. It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children. Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience? What is it to be treated as a child? Women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves. It is no accident that the liberation of women, such as it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general; liberation for one part of the ‘not-men’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you. The assumption that all groups in the ‘not-men’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children. ‘That's what they used to say about women’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false. But it should make us very suspicious. That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all, but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill's famous disclaimer in his essay On Liberty . Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection, Mill (1910) asserts: this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the  maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. (p.73) This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings. The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational. If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children. I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place. Partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘children’ covers such a wide range of potential images, I shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society. She is the child of this paper unless I indicate otherwise. Throughout we should ask ourselves, does this (whatever is being said) apply to her ? First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past. One thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults; in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have. NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18…. the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty; the woman has but its authority is imperfect; so has the child, but in this case it is immature. (Aristotle, 1959,1260A) Children…are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained the use of speech but are called Reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. (Hobbes, 1914, p. 21) [Children]…love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined…[by which]… I mean, that you should  make them sensible by the Mildness of your carriage, and the composure even in your correction of them, that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them. (Locke, 1968, p. 181) In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done. Young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are, or they get puzzled and ask question after question. But as we approach the age of youth reason appears. At what age ought the education for youth to begin? Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect… The youth…is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement. (Kant, 1930, pp. 250–1) If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences. (Mill, 1910, p. 139) What are the philosophers' children like? They have an ‘immature’ deliberative faculty (Aristotle), are not ‘endued with Reason’(Hobbes), until roughly the age of 10 (Kant) and are ‘incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives’(Mill). But they are not completely lost causes. The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the ‘possibility apparent’ of turning into rational beings (Hobbes); they love to be treated as though they were rational though they are not so yet (Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles (Kant). Until the time when these things happen then Mill's disclaimer comes into operation. Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions. The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; that is, on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals. It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both. In either case, the political implication is that denying rights  to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests. In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection. Beyond that, the similarities seem remote. There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle. Apart from being false, such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states. The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational, non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill. Children, according to Hobbes, have the ‘possibility apparent’ of becoming reasonable. In what does the possibility consist? Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the ‘possibility apparent’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones. But what? Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have. It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child. Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others. But then, either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘intelligently’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals. In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it. Locke's remarks are just as puzzling. Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were. How is this possible? Apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is. Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice? Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes; I must at least say something. Is it just that I talk to them that they love? Maybe, but I can also, if I like, talk to my car, but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational. Lockean children have the added  amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves, while Kantian kids, two stages back from rationality, have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions. Mill's minors are a little more complicated. Part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree. But in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions. Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene. All in all, it is a pretty unconvincing picture. If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are. If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults. Hobbes et al . are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why, often in the same sentence, they produce these contradictions. The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery. ILLEGITIMATE INFERENCES The recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot, therefore, be denied it on any account. We should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left, the pederast lobby or children themselves. It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought. In Escape from Childhood (1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be. He sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children's needs, and an oppressive invention at that. He suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote, to manage their own financial affairs, to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and  to make and enter into, on a basis of mutual consent, quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms. Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience. He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years, and remarks: We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add. Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible? (Harris, 1982, p. 49) Now Holt and Harris both have many wise, enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children, but as these remarks show, putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter. Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions. What, we may ask Holt, happens to the child who, dissatisfied at home, seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him? What if no one wants him? Our papers are currently full of ‘hard-to-place’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents. In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others. What, we may ask Harris, happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination? To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination. He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults. These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise. In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here. Suppose Holt's 6-year-old does opt out of school? What happens to her then? What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her? Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead? However much she may enjoy such pursuits, there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied. Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her, who will? His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide. Holt's child is actually the Artful Dodger; mercifully, not all children are. There are other difficulties too. It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to, but Holt clearly does not. He proposes that ‘the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them’(Holt, 1974, p. 15). If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children, then he is mistaken. The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them. He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties, but he cannot forgo them. They are not just available to him, they are his. That is what being a citizen involves. Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children. Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them. But the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities. Failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral; failure to carry out one's duties is not. It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens. Children still would not have full political status. Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen; they are an integral part of being a citizen. Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities  and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark: I do not say, either, that these rights and duties should be tied into one package, that if a young person wants to assume any of them, he must assume them all. He should be able to pick and choose. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) If he can ‘pick and choose’, I suggest, he is not a citizen, he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option. Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem. They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all. Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness. WHEN IN DOUBT, GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense. That it is firmly tied must be correct; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information. Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it. Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the Politics which I quoted earlier; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority. What did he mean? What he did not mean is that women lack rationality; they can and do deliberate. At first sight what he seems to be saying is simply that no one is going to take any notice of the conclusions which a rational woman reaches after deliberation. On further reflection, I think this is exactly what he is saying, and its significance is immense. His  view is that the judgements which women make have no standing. Keeping to the domestic front for the moment, what this means is that the conclusions which women reach, no matter how carefully and intelligently they are worked out, can never have the status of decisions. You cannot decide, though you may desire, to divorce your husband if the law does not allow; you cannot order the wine if only his signature makes the order legitimate. And your inability to decide or to order has nothing to do with your mental powers. But Aristotle is not just making a sociological point about what is and is not permitted to women in his society. His remark goes deeper than that. It refers not to power but to authority, and what I think he means is that although a woman can make good and wise judgements, she cannot be the arbiter of that goodness or wisdom. For that she needs the ratification of men, and that is enough to conclude that her judgements lack authority. Now that is quite different from saying that women always make bad judgements, that is to say, that they suffer from some deficiency of rationality. Aristotle only produces spurious suggestions about a woman's incapacity to think or to stick to principles when he is obliged to say something about why their judgements lack authority. It then looks as though the argument runs: (1) Women lack some moral or cognitive capacity therefore (2) Women (must) lack authority. In truth this version is the argument on its head; its real form is: (1) Women lack authority therefore (2) Women (must) lack some moral or cognitive capacity. The important point here is that Aristotle's women are not autonomous, not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority; that is, their right to make decisions, to speak for themselves is not acknowledged. This acknowledgement is absolutely essential, for without it no mental act which they perform, however well, will count as a decision at all. The point I am making here is based on an observation by Stanley Cavell (1979, p. 460) and repeated by him in many contexts: ‘a human being could not fail to know, confronting me, that I am a human being’. Why not? Because to see someone is to see them as a human being and to see them as a human being is to acknowledge them as such. This acknowledgement is not derived from a prior knowledge of facts, rather it is a precondition of there being any  facts. We do not, on the Cavell model, first discover certain truths about an object and then conclude that it is a person; we first acknowledge the person and only inquire into facts later if necessary. The point was put graphically by my colleague, Ian Ground. Faced with a row of objects we do not, he said, lampooning Wittgenstein, perform appropriately by pointing to one after the other saying that's a tree, that's a tree, that's a man, that's a tree. Rather we will say (pointing) that's a tree,(pointing) that's a tree,(waving) hello!(pointing) that's a tree. What makes us greet the man is not an albeit swift chain of inference, it is his presence which commands the acknowledgement while the presence of the tree does no such thing. Of course, if the man is clearly carved from stone then pointing is in order, and if we subsequently discover that ‘he’ is an inflatable rubber doll we are suitably embarrassed. But we are embarrassed because we got it wrong when usually we do not. In our viewing of the other we see ourselves being viewed; the recognition is mutual. How then is it possible to withhold acknowledgement? Cavell's answer is that it is not. There is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being. In a poignant discussion of the hypothesis that Southern slave owners did not see their slaves as human beings he disagrees: When he wants to be served at table by a black hand, he would not be satisfied to be served by a black paw… Everything in his relation to his slaves shows that he treats them as more or less human — his humiliations of them, his disappointments, his jealousies, his fears, his punishments, his attachments. (Cavell, 1979, p. 376) Treating people as if they were not people is not a possibility; to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster, but it always breaks down. What is possible is to treat people as more or less human. We can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts. This may not be downright evil, but in the absence of potential disbarments (like possibly being a rubber doll) it requires a considerable amount of bad faith. It is very hard to do. This is what Aristotle appears to do to his women. They are human, and are acknowledged to be, they can think but they are not to be acknowledged as authoritative, and if their presence demands such  acknowledgement, they are bad women who should have been taught to hide or repress such demands. Rousseau's blueprint for the education of Sophie is directed at this end, and if it is truly successful, she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement. Then she has been infantilised and she is no longer autonomous. But Rousseau's blueprint contains its own contradiction. If you need to teach people or compel them in some other way to repress their natural demand for acknowledgement as rational, competent, authoritative human beings then you have no answer to the charge of some malefaction between bad faith and dreadful wickedness. Is this unfair to children? When we deny autonomy to our 10-year-old, are we too guilty of bad faith? What reason could we produce to allow that she may have the capacity to act autonomously while denying her the capacity-to-act-autonomously? Whatever it is we should first notice that while the capacity to act autonomously is construed as a psychological capacity, the capacity-to-act-autonomously is not. It is a social capacity which depends upon the acknowledgement of others. What we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust; we have to ask, does her being demand it. CARRYING THE CAN To do this we need to consider another element in the picture of autonomy which was so meticulously side-stepped by Holt. That is, the matter of responsibility. In Freedom and Resentment (1974, p. 19) Strawson talks not of a child's emerging autonomy but of ‘the progressive emergence of the child as a responsible being’. Responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lip-service is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children. I believe it to be central. In his essay, ‘In Defense of Anarchism’(1970), R. P. Wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy. He argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to take responsibility for those actions. To take responsibility is to accept the duty of deciding for oneself what is right. A man, Wolff argues, can forfeit his autonomy by not  taking the responsibility on himself; by, for example, obeying commands blindly; but he cannot abnegate the responsibility which the possibility of choice confers upon him. Since being autonomous includes both freedom of choice and the capacity to reason about those choices, the impairment of either is a bar to autonomy. Against this background he makes two remarks about children: It is quite appropriate that moral philosophers should group together children and madmen as beings not fully responsible for their actions, for as madmen are thought to lack freedom of choice, so children do not yet possess the power of reason in a developed form. It is even just that we should assign a greater degree of responsibility to children, for madmen, by virtue of their lack of free will, are completely without responsibility, while children, insofar as they possess reason in a partially developed form, can be held responsible (i.e. can be required to take responsibility) to a corresponding degree. (Wolff, 1970, pp. 12–13) All men refuse to take responsibility for their actions at some time or other during their lives, and some men so consistently shirk their duty that they present more the appearance of overgrown children than of adults. (Ibid., p. 14) There is a striking similarity between Wolff's way of talking about children and the views we saw put forward by Hobbes, Locke and Kant. Wolff begins with the assurance that children are not rational and then immediately back-pedals to say that actually they are, partially at least. Four paragraphs later where the second quotation appears, the child is not unable to take responsibility but is refusing to take it. She is not an incompetent but a degenerate. Having denied that she is incompetent, I am certainly not going to concede that the only alternative is to make her a degenerate; there must be another choice available. What is missing from Wolff's analysis, though it is present in his terminology, is the recognition of the public face, the mutuality of responsibility. He talks of assigning responsibility to children,holding them responsible,requiring them to take responsibility and these are natural ways of speaking. What they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason; now a third party is present and is an  active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role. People are not only responsible for something, they are responsible to God, other individuals, society or themselves, and this latter Kantian notion is derived from the primary social context in which it makes sense for the concept of responsibility to be invoked. This is just what I was claiming for authority. To say either that someone acts authoritatively or that someone is responsible for his actions may depend upon the possibility of ascribing mental states or capacities but neither is merely a shorthand way of ascribing them. In the case of the fully autonomous person, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. The capacity-to-act-autonomously is the coming together of the two. If both or either is impaired then so is this capacity, and both depend upon the psychological capacities of the agent plus the recognition of other members of the moral and political community. This raises a difficulty. PASSING THE BUCK The problem here seems to be this: am I saying that a child is responsible if and only if we declare her to be so, given that she knows what she is doing? This view has some historical clout. Given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions. Children were still being imprisoned and deported when Mill wrote that disclaimer. Is it then just a matter of fashion, of the times in which we live? Not entirely; to begin with we might take a pragmatic line in the light of new knowledge about the long-term effects of such treatment on a child's subsequent development. We might argue that while we can hold her responsible, the consequences of so doing turn out to be unacceptable. But the horror which writers such as Dickens expressed at the cruelty of his times was prompted by no such knowledge. Dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up at all. What Dickens saw was what most of us see, the inhumanity of treating a child in certain ways. In what does the inhumanity consist? Not just in harsh action; increased concern about children is almost always part of a larger concern about people in general, but when horrible things are happening to people it is not unusual to focus on children and try special pleading on their behalf. This special pleading is, no doubt, partly emotional but it might very well include reference to  children's lack of knowledge and understanding. Yet the inhumanity does not consist in the ascription of certain cognitive states either. We may be quite right to ascribe agency to a child for his acts. The inhumanity seems to lie in allowing the full weight of responsibility to fall on the child. Responsibility is not only about agency. ‘When we say a person is responsible for what he does we mean not just that he was the agent…we also say that the act reflects (back) on the agent,’ writes David Wood (1973, p. 191). How much reflecting goes on depends upon the reflective capabilities of the child and also on the strength and direction of the beam which we, the adults, determine. Perhaps now we can take Mill's insight on board without opening ourselves to the charge of arbitrariness. Mill wanted to protect children against the harm which they might do themselves. The problem which was supposed to bring liberal theory crashing to the ground was that we do not wish to justify interfering with adult liberties on these grounds. It may be that what we are protecting children from is not so much the awful consequences of their ignorant decisions but of the burden of responsibility for those decisions which children are not yet ready to bear and which, for entirely non-political reasons, we cannot choose to impose upon them. If giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a one-person game, then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but I have already argued that they are not and could not be. We can only play at ascribing responsibility outside this mutual interaction; making the horse a senator, blaming the toy which the child trips over are games which do not fool the horse or the toy. Growing up, maturing, emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly. Respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it. We leave unhappy teenagers who ‘don't want to talk about it’ alone; the tearful 5-year-old comes and dumps the problem in your lap. In between, we say, we ‘play it by ear’ and what we listen for is the child's own claim to have its decisions treated as authoritative and to be ready to bear the responsibility. This claim is not a conscious, spoken claim; if it gets to that stage, we have already left it too late. The claim is implicit in the child's own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we  can do no other than acknowledge it. But neither can we impose it. Holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible; we may succeed in the former, without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter. Now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that I have still, therefore, failed to distinguish them from children. However, there is a difference. With children, the presupposition is that we take the responsibility until they show us that they want it; with adults we assume that they take the responsibility unless they show us that they don't. (We are surprised when the ‘man’ turns out to be a robot.) That is what membership of the moral and political community is, and it is a serious business which deserves more attention than I can give here. It is quite correct that children's application for membership should be taken seriously; once accepted there is no turning back, resignation is not an option. To end, a word about voting. Voting is not just a matter of knowing how to put a cross on a piece of paper, nor of having a rough or even quite refined view of the policies of the major political parties. It also, in a democracy, involves being responsible to some degree for the society which we have. Maybe ‘I didn't vote Tory’, but even that does not enable me to opt out of that responsibility entirely. Why else would I buy the sticker? Let us ask our 10-year-old's mother if her daughter is ready to take that responsibility. What would she say? Perhaps that, yes, her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable; yes, she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions. Also, perhaps, that sometimes at night, she finds her crying for the starving of Africa or unable to sleep with the terror of the possibility of nuclear war or desperately seeking a denial of the reality of the horror of the Holocaust. Perhaps she would be angry if, by trying to impose responsibility on her daughter by giving her the vote, we were also taking from her the only comfort which she has, namely that when she is older she will change all that. Or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready; she would be right. Denying the vote to children is not based on some false assumption about 10-year-olds' political knowledge, nor to deny that they have interests, nor to protect them from the harm their votes might do. It is to take responsibility to ourselves for the way the world is. And that really does belong to us."
ACA ACA-EWW-003 0.080000000000001 "Properties of Matrices 1.1 ASSUMPTIONS, CONVENTIONS; TRANSPOSITION AND RELATED DEFINITIONS In this chapter we shall discuss certain characteristics and properties of matrices which are of particular importance in dynamical studies of systems with multiple degrees of freedom. We assume the reader to be familiar with the notation of matrices and with the rules of combination: addition, multiplication, etc., and with conformability and non-permutability. We also assume familiarity with the elementary rules for combination and evaluation of determinants. In general, matrices are rectangular; but of particular importance are matrices having equal numbers of rows and columns — i.e. square matrices — and those having only a single row or column, which we call vectors; both types are special forms of rectangular matrices. Normally, we shall use capital bold type, e.g. A, to denote square and rectangular matrices having two or more rows and columns, and lower case bold type, e.g. x, to denote vectors. If a matrix A has m rows and n columns, i.e. it is of order (m × n), its typical element  lies at the intersection of the ith row and jth column (). If we form the matrix  by writing columns for rows in order, the new matrix, of order (n × m) is called the transpose of A and is denoted by . For example, . The process is clearly one of reflection in the diagonal containing the terms , which is described as the principal diagonal. It is of particular importance in square matrices. The terms  in A form the superdiagonal and  the infradiagonal, while for a square matrix of order (n × n)— or more simply, of order n — the elements , form the secondary diagonal. An important property of a square matrix is its trace; this is the sum of all the elements in the principal diagonal. Wherever it saves space, we shall always write a column vector x as  the braces{} denote that this is to be read as a column. Since in dynamics, we are usually more often concerned with columns than with rows, we shall write a row vector as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. . 1.2 SYMMETRIC AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC MATRICES If , the matrices, which are necessarily square, are termed symmetric; if , they are said to be skew-symmetric: in this case, since  = , the principal diagonal has zero elements. A square matrix having zeros everywhere except in the principal diagonal is called a diagonal matrix and is clearly symmetric. The unit matrix I is a diagonal matrix of unit elements; a matrix having all its elements zero is said to be null and is written 0. It is possible to express any square matrix as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix; this is shown by the identity . The first term is unaltered by transposition; the second changes sign. 1.3 REVERSAL OF ORDER ON TRANSPOSITION If we have a matrix product A = BC, where B is of order (m × r) and C of order (r × n), then A is of order (m × n). If , B and C are conformable only in that order. The typical product element is  . Transpose B and C; Then  are of orders (r × m),(n × r) respectively, and are therefore conformable only in the order . Moreover , or . Hence transposition of a matrix product requires reversal of the order of the matrices. By an obvious extension, if A = BCD, then , and so on. In view of the formulae (1) and (2) it is clear that these results hold whether or not B, C are conformable both in the order BC and in the order CB, including the case where both are square. For the unit and null matrices,(1) implies . 1.4. PARTITIONING OF MATRICES Any matrix may be partitioned, by drawing dotted lines between adjacent columns and adjacent rows, into submatrices. We do this, notionally, in any matrix multiplication: if we are performing the operation BC = A then we isolate a row of B and a column of C — respectively (1 × n) and (n × 1) submatrices — to produce an element — i.e. a (1 × 1) submatrix of A. Similarly, we could, for example, isolate the first three rows of B and the first four columns of C and multiply these submatrices, of order (3 × n) and (n × 4), to give a (3 × 4) submatrix in the top left corner of A. Again, since  it makes no different if we divide the range, s, of summation into subranges; each subrange can be summed, and these sums added to give the total. This is equivalent to vertical partitioning in B with conformable partitioning in C. An example will make this clear. The product BC = A could be  , where B is (4 × 5), C is (5 × 6) and A is (4 × 6). Here B has been partitioned between the second and third rows to give, at the top, a (2 × 5) submatrix (ignore the vertical partition for the moment); C between the fourth and fifth columns to give, on the left, a (5 × 4) submatrix. Multiplied together, these give the (2 × 4) submatrix at the top left in A. The vertical partition in B, after the third column, and the corresponding partition in C, which must be after the third row, merely divide each summation into two parts. Symbolically, we may write the operation as , where the elements  etc are now the above submatrices. It is important to note the conformability; thus  is (2 × 2) × (2 × 4) = (2 × 4) also; and  is also (2 × 4). It is evident that, though partitioning is largely arbitrary, conformability both in multiplication and in addition is essential. Partitioning is often of great use, both in analytical manipulation of matrices and in numerical cases, especially when submatrices can be chosen having simple forms, such as a unit or a null submatrix. 1.5 SINGULAR MATRICES, DEGENERACY AND RANK In a square matrix A of order n the array of elements has a determinant  which is in general nonzero: this implies that the columns (and the rows) are linearly independent, so that there is no nonzero column vector x such that Ax vanishes. If, however, a vector x does exist for which Ax = 0, this clearly means that any column of A can be expressed as a linear sum of the remaining columns; by the rules for evaluation of determinants this requires  to be zero. If two different vectors x exist for which Ax = 0, then not only is zero, but also all the minor determinants of order (n — 1) vanish. When , the matrix A is said to be singular. If only one vector x exists for which Ax = 0, A is said to be simply degenerate, or to have simple degeneracy; if more than one such vector x exists, A has multiple degeneracy. Complementary to the definition of degeneracy is that of rank: for a square matrix, the sum of the degeneracy and rank is the order of the matrix; thus   The rank is in fact the order of the largest nonvanishing minor of , so that rank 0 implies a null matrix. We shall be much concerned in this text with matrices which are simply degenerate (degeneracy 1) and with matrices in which all columns (and all rows) are proportional to each other; in the latter case all second-order minors vanish, so that the rank is 1. In general, for a rectangular matrix, the rank is the number of linearly independent rows (and columns). 1.6 FACTORISATION OF MATRICES All matrices can be factorised, usually in a variety of ways. In the simplest (trivial) case we may write A = AI = IA where I is the conformable unit matrix. Even I itself can be factorised in a variety of ways; as one example, if J is the square matrix which has units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which we shall call the reversing matrix, then ; e.g. for order 3  so that J is a double factor of I. The ability to factorise a matrix appropriately can often be of great assistance in solving practical problems. Singular matrices can be factorised as the product of two rectangular matrices — again, in more ways than one — the orders of which are determined by the rank of the matrix. This may be illustrated by a simple numerical example. Let   Inspection shows the third column to be the sum of the first two. Hence if we partition the matrix appropriately,  where the submatrix products are written separately. If now we postmultiply the (3 × 2) submatrix of A by I, we can add the last result to it to recover A as the matrix product  Finally, a matrix of rank 1 can be expressed as the product of a column and a row in that order — for such a matrix has effectively only one independent column, all the other columns being proportional to it; similarly for the rows. For example  In general, any singular matrix of order n and rank r is expressible in an infinite number of ways as the product of two matrices of order (n × r) and (r × n), since r is the number of independent columns (and rows). 1.7 ADJUGATE AND RECIPROCAL MATRICES If  is a square matrix of order n, and if, in the determinant , the element  has the cofactor  (that is, the value of the determinant obtained from  by deleting the ith row and jth column, leaving a minor of order (n — 1) which is then multiplied by , then by the rules for evaluation of determinants  while   since the summation in the latter result gives the value of a determinant having two equal rows. It follows that if the cofactors  are arranged as a matrix  of order n, then  where, to conform with matrix multiplication rules, we must use the transpose of  to postmultiply A. If instead of a row summation as in (1) we use column summation, we find also  so that A and  are permutable. The matrix  is called the adjugate of A. If A is singular, so that  vanishes, then  In this case, if A is simply degenerate,  is of rank 1; but if A is multiply degenerate, so that all the cofactors of Aij vanish for all i, j, then  is null. These results are examples of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (see Theorem XII of 1.22), viz. the degeneracy of the product of two matrices is at least as great as the degeneracy of either factor, and at most as great as the sum of the degeneracies of the factors. When , we may divide  by , calling the result R. then AR = I, and R can be described as the reciprocal or the inverse of A. We have already seen that it permutes with A; however, this is readily proved alternatively. Let  from the latter, postmultiplying by R1, we have R2AR = R1, and using the former, R2 = R1. Moreover, the reciprocal is unique; for if AR1 = I and AR2 = I, then A (R1 — R2) = 0, and on premultiplication by R1 we have R1 = R2. In conformity with usual algebraic notation, the reciprocal of A is written  so that a separate symbol is unnecessary. Thus  expresses the essential property of the reciprocal of A. Just as with transposition, if a matrix product is inverted the order of the factors must be reversed. Let A = BCD, where the matrices are all square and non-singular. By premultiplication or  postmultiplication as required, we have successively  1.8 POWERS OF MATRICES, POLYNOMIALS AND SERIES We have just established the existence of a negative power of a square non-singular matrix. In general, any square matrix can be raised to any positive integral power by continued multiplication, in any order, by itself. Any such powers are evidently permutable; for example  Similarly, any power of a matrix may itself be raised to a power; for example  while if A is non-singular  Evidently, the index laws of ordinary algebra apply. In particular,  where A is non-singular; in fact  applies for all square matrices. Just as we can have polynomials involving powers of a scalar quantity{ gl}, e.g.  so we can have polynomials of a square matrix A:  where the  are scalar multipliers. Polynomials of matrices are of great importance in a variety of ways. For example, suppose we can find a set of multipliers pi such that P(A) vanishes. Then, if  exists, we may premultiply or postmultiply P(A) by  to obtain  as a convenient formula for computing . We can also define matrix series; for example the parallel series  exp A converges in exactly the same way as exp{ gl}. In parallel with the scalar series, exp (-A) is the reciprocal of exp A.  If, as in (2) and (3), we have a polynomial or series in a scalar quantity{ gl}and the corresponding function in the square matrix A, we may multiply the scalar function by I to obtain the two matrix functions  Subtraction term by term then gives  where Q is a function we need not evaluate here. The matrix  is of very great importance, not only in studies of the intrinsic properties of A, but also in dynamical and other applications it is called the characteristic matrix of A. 1.9 SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX We have already defined symmetric, skew-symmetric, diagonal, unit and null matrices. We now summarise and extend these definitions. (1) Symmetric matrix — characterised by A = AT. (2) Skew-symmetric matrix — characterised by A = — AT. (3) Diagonal matrix — characterised by . We now establish an important property of diagonal matrices. Let C be any square matrix and D a conformable diagonal matrix with diagonal elements . Then postmultiplication of C by D multiplies the columns of C in order by , etc., while premultiplication of C by D multiplies the rows of C in order by , etc. Thus, the typical element of CD is  while that of DC is . It follows that if C and D permute, so that DC = CD, then  if . For a diagonal matrix D having all its diagonal elements different, it follows that C must then also be diagonal. If D has some equal diagonal elements, then C can possess nonzero off-diagonal elements in a ""diagonal submatrix"" corresponding to the equal elements of D. For example, if  which we write as D = Diag(1,2,3), and   then if C and D are to permute we must have  so that d = e = f = g = h = k = 0, leaving C = Diag (a, b, c). However, if D = Diag(1,2,3) we have that  so that e = g = h = k = 0 leaving  which we may write as Block Diag  where  Finally, we note that if  for all i, then . This follows from the identity . (4) Unit matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with units in the diagonal positions; it is written I. (5) Scalar matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with the same scalar quantity, say , in the diagonal positions. Evidently such a matrix may be written ; multiplication by a scalar matrix therefore implies multiplication by a scalar quantity. (6) Reversing matrix — this is the square matrix having units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere; it is written J. Postmultiplication of any matrix C by the conformable J matrix reverses the order of the columns of C while premultiplication by J reverses the order of the rows. (7) Null matrix — this has zero elements throughout. (8) Triangular matrices — these are of two types: lower triangular, L, and upper triangular, U. L is characterised by a typical element having the property  while U is characterised by . Thus, for example  are, respectively, lower and upper triangular matrices. An obvious and useful property of triangular matrices is that their determinants are simply the products of their diagonal terms. Thus, in the above example,  Another useful property of triangular matrices is the ease with which their reciprocals may be calculated. For example, if R = (Rij) is the reciprocal of a lower triangular matrix L then  where a, b, c,…must be nonzero; otherwise  and R does not exist. The first row of the product gives  and in view of this, the second row, excluding its first element, gives  and so on. Accordingly, R is also lower triangular, and its diagonal elements are , as is otherwise obvious from consideration of the cofactors of a, b, c,…in L. Hence a computer program to find R needs to calculate only the n (n — 2) /2 elements below the diagonal; and these are found progressively. For example  gives, from the first column,  and from the second column,   Transposition of the above shows that the reciprocal of an upper triangular matrix U is itself upper triangular, and that its diagonal elements are the reciprocals of those of U. (9) Persymmetric matrix — this is a square matrix in which the elements in any line parallel to the secondary diagonal are equal. Thus, if A is persymmetric, it is characterised by the typical element  and hence has, in general, 2n — 1 independent elements. For example, the matrix  is persymmetric. (10) Centrosymmetric and centroskew matrices — a matrix which is symmetric about the centre point of its array is said to be centrosymmetric; thus, if A is centrosymmetric, of order n, it is characterised by  More simply, if J is the reversing matrix, a centrosymmetric matrix has the property A = JAJ A centroskew matrix is characterised by the equation A = JAJ. For example, the matrices  are centrosymmetric, while the matrices  are centroskew. Centrosymmetric matrices and centroskew vectors arise in the study of the dynamics of mechanical systems having physical symmetry (e.g. a suspension bridge). (11) Orthogonal matrices — a square, non-singular matrix A having the property  is said to be orthogonal. Orthogonal matrices are of very great importance in dynamics. For example, the matrix  is orthogonal, since  It should be noted that the determinant of the above orthogonal matrix is unity: in general an orthogonal matrix will have  as its determinant since  (12) Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices — if a matrix, A, has complex elements, it can clearly be written in the form  where B and C are real matrices and  is the conjugate of A. If B is symmetric and C is skew-symmetric, A is said to be Hermitian. Evidently in this case  If B is skew-symmetric and C is symmetric, A is said to be skew-Hermitian. Evidently in this case  For example, the matrix  is Hermitian, while the matrix   is skew-Hermitian. It should be noted that if A is Hermitian, then iA is a skew-Hermitian. (13) The isolating vector ei — this vector is the ith column of the unit matrix; it has a unit in the ith element and zeros elsewhere. The operation  isolates the ith row of A, while Aej isolates the jth column. The combined operation  gives the isolated element of  (14) The summing vector  — this is the vector of which all elements are units. Evidently  gives a row which is the sum of all the rows of A and A{gs} sums all the columns of A. Its principal use is in the checking of numerical operations. The above list is by no means exhaustive, but it covers most of the matrix types which arise in the present text. 1.10 VARIABLE MATRICES, LINEAR SUBSTITUTIONS AND ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS So far, we have discussed the properties of matrices, and the algebra of matrices, in general terms, and without reference to the nature of the elements: where illustrations have been given we have used arithmetical numbers for elements. But the elements can of course be variables. They may, for example, all be functions of time, so that we must write A = A(t); they may be functions of a parameter, typified by  when the elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}, the matrix is called a lambda-matrix; or the elements may themselves (especially for vectors) be independent variables. Finally, when sets of differential equations are written in matrix form, some of the matrices will be, in effect, operators. We now proceed to examine some simple cases. Suppose first that we have a set of variables  related to a second set  by an equation of the type y = Ax; such a relation might, for example, connect the coordinates, referred to two different sets of axes, of a point moving in n-space. Such a relation is called liner substitution. Apart from its intrinsic importance, it is of interest since the subject of matrices evolved from it. Cayley took a set of equations such as  and enclosed each side in brackets, so that two equal columns could be connected by a single equality sign. He then extracted the vector x and wrote it vertically as a parallel to y, so requiring the row-by-column rule for multiplication. A second substitution of the same kind, such as z = By. implies z = By = BAx, so that BA is the matrix converting x into z. If the values of x are unknown, but y is given (say y = b) then we have a set of linear algebraic equations for x: Ax = b, of which the formal solution is : however, various well known methods exist for finding x without computing  (see 2.5). As a very simple example of a linear substitution, consider the coordinates of a point P relative to two sets of axes  mutually inclined at an angle  Evidently  elimination of r,  gives   and it should be noted that in this case the matrix of transformation is orthogonal. The formal solution  (3) assumes that A is non-singular. Suppose, however, that A has degeneracy s. Then s of the rows implicit in (3) may be compounded from the remaining n — s rows, and so provide no extra information. These s rows, including the appropriate elements of b, may thus be discarded. We are left with n — s rows which may be written in partitioned matrix form as  where A1 is a non-singular submatrix of A of order (n — s)(some reordering of the elements of x may be necessary to obtain the non-singular minor),  is of the order  and c is the reduced vector b; x has been partitioned conformably into n — s elements (y) and s elements (z). We may write this equation as  Equation (5) is known as a parametric solution: since we have only n — s independent relations we can determine only n — s unknowns (y) in terms of the remaining s quantities (z), which may be regarded as arbitrary parameters in the problem. 1.11 BILINEAR AND QUADRATIC FORMS Scalar functions often arise which are linear and homogeneous in two sets of variables x1,…, xn and y1,…, ym. By inspection, it is evident that such a function may be written as  when x, y are written as columns. Here A, of order (m × n) is called the matrix of the form. Suppose we wish to express f in terms of new variables , where  then  so that  is the matrix of the new form. We say hat A and  are connected by an equivalent transformation. If the elements of x, y are independent variables, we may differentiate with respect to them. For example, from (1) above,  is the first element in the column Ax,  the second, etc., so that  In this text, we shall be more concerned with quadratic forms, obtained from bilinear forms such as  when y = x, so that  where A is now necessarily square. Moreover, although in the formulation of A the elements Aij and Aji may not be equal, we may note that (see 1.2)  and on transposition it follows that  so that A may be replaced by its symmetric equivalent ; we now assume that A is symmetric. Then if we form  we have  since transposition of the second term repeats the first. Thus, since  If we express a quadratic form  in terms of another set of variables y given by the linear substitution x = By, then  where  and we observe that C, like A, is symmetric. A transformation of type (2), in which A, C need not in general be symmetric, but in which B is square and non-singular, is described as a congruent transformation and is of particular importance in dynamics. A quadratic form  and the matrix A within f, are said to be positive definite (pos. def.) if  for all real, non-null vectors x. We may construct a table for such definitions (Table 1). Necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadratic form to be pos. def. are established in Theorem XIII of 1.22. If a skew-symmetric, transposition shows that  vanishes.  1.12 EQUIVALENT MATRICES AND CANONICAL FORMS We have just defined the general equivalent transformation, and this leads naturally to the important concept of equivalent matrices. We approach this by considering the elementary operations which are commonly used in the condensation of determinants. Let I  be the unit matrix with its ith and jth rows interchanged. The new matrix is symmetric, since both its i, jth and j, ith elements are unity; moreover, its determinant is -1, since in moving the jth row to the ith position  we cross j — i rows; but the original ith row is now the i + 1th and so in taking it to the jth position we cross j — i — 1 rows. In view of its symmetry  can equally be obtained by interchange of the ith and jth columns instead of rows. Let us restrict ourselves to square matrices; then premultiplication of any matrix A by  has the effect of interchanging the ith and jth rows of A; postmultiplication of A by  interchanges the ith and jth columns. Next, let  be the unit matrix with the addition of an element k in the  position. Then premultiplication of A by  has the effect of adding k times the jth row of A to the ith row; similarly the operation AI(kij) has the effect of adding k times the ith column of A to the jth column. The determinant of  is clearly unity. Finally, let  be the unit matrix with the element  substituted for the unit in the i, ith position. Then I(li)A multiplies the ith row of A by l; A multiplies the ith column of A by l. This operation is evidently an extension of the I operation; instead of adding multiples of a different row (or column) to a given row, it adds multiples of the same row; however, it differs in that now the determinant is l. The reciprocal of I is I itself, since a double interchange of two rows restores the original matrix; the reciprocal of I is also evidently I and that of . Any product of these various matrices is always non-singular. Two matrices, A, B are said to be equivalent if one can be derived from the other by any finite number of elementary operations of the types specified above. Hence, if all the premultiplications and postmultiplications are grouped together to form (non-singular) matrices P and Q respectively, and A, B are equivalent, then B = PAQ and  Since k, l are arbitrary (except that ) it follows that there is a infinite number of matrices B equivalent to A. However, there is one matrix which is of especially simple form; it is described as the canonical form of A. First, let us suppose that A is non-singular. If A11 = 0 we can bring any non-zero element to the A11 position by the use of I we can then reduce this element to unity by the use of I(l), and then reduce all the remaining elements of the first row and the first column to zero using I(k). We do the same for the submatrix bordered by the first row and column, and so on, so that finally we reach the unit matrix as the canonical form for A. It is to be observed that, since in using elementary operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l) on A we are effectively at each stage multiplying together determinants neither of which vanishes, the reduction of A to I must be possible when A is on-singular. In passing, we may note that, since PAQ = I,  Now suppose A to be singular, of rank r and order n. This means that all minor determinants of order r + 1 vanish, but at least one minor of order r is not zero. None of the operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l), in so far as they affect the minors, can make a minor of order r + 1 nonzero, nor make the minor of order r vanish, since they merely condense these minors. We may therefore use the processes above as for a non-singular matrix; we achieve a series of units in the positions; the other elements in the matrix are all zero. The canonical form of A is thus  where I is of order r. If B = PAQ, where P, Q are non-singular but otherwise arbitrary, then the canonical forms for P, Q are the unit matrix. It follows that P, Q can be constructed from I by elementary operations; accordingly, if any such product, provided only that P, Q are non-singular, A and B are equivalent matrices; and in particular, they will have the same rank. 1.13 LAMBDA-MATRICES We have already defined a lambda-matrix of which the elements are rational integral functions of some parameter  Such matrices arise in many problems of mechanics. For example, suppose we have a pair of simultaneous differential equations  where the coefficients  are constants. We can write these as  where the column matrices are all functions of time. An alternative symbolic formulation would be  where D = d/dt and the square matrix is now an operator on x. Finally, if we are seeking the complementary function of the equations, we write x proportional to exp  and obtain  as the equations determining  and the ratio  In abbreviated form this can be written . The equation determining  is obtained from the vanishing of the determinant of the lambda-matrix; it is evidently a quartic in  and each of the four roots will have its own associated vector x. While it is often convenient to deal with equations such as(2) in the way indicated, it is also often useful to transform them into first-order equations. This may be done in various ways, but one simple and useful device is to adopt two auxiliary variables:  and to write the equations in the form  Then if we now write  and  proportional to exp  and again seek the complementary function, the four equations may be written, with a little rearrangement,  This equation can clearly be written in partitioned form as  or  where  The quartic determinantal equation obtained from this first-order set of equations may be seen by inspection to be identical with that obtained from the quadratic formulation. A matrix of the form M +  is called a matrix pencil (see 2.9, 2.10). 1.14 ADJUGATE LAMBDA-MATRICES If A  is a lambda-matrix, its elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}and so also, therefore, are the cofactors{ ga}of the elements of A: hence the adjugate,  of A is also a lambda-matrix, and   We shall denote the determinant  by . The reciprocal of A, however, being  divided by  is not a lambda-matrix, unless it should happen that  is independent of . 1.15 EQUIVALENT LAMBDA-MATRICES If we have an equivalent transformation  where P, Q may be constructed by any of the elementary operations defined in 2.12, then B and A are equivalent. It should be noted that the determinants of P, Q must be non-vanishing constants, though  may appear in them. This implies that in an operation I(k) we may see I( ),; but  will not appear in I(l) operations, except in a self-cancelling form, e.g. we could use I(l) with  in the ith place, following with I(l) with  in the jith place, so that the product of the two steps has unit determinant. I (i, j) is, of course, independent of . Using elementary operations of this kind, we may construct a canonical form of lambda-matrices, which is diagonal, the elements in the diagonal being functions of . The canonical form is not unique; the best-known form is that due to Smith (see Ref. (1)). If C( ); is the canonical form, since C{ () = PA( )Q; we have  and since  are non-vanishing constants, we have that  and  differ only by a scalar multiplier. Hence the roots of  are identical with those of . 1.16 THE CHARACTERISTIC MATRIX AND ITS EIGENVALUES Suppose we have a linear substitution Ax = y in which it is required that y be a scalar multiple of x, say x. Then x — Ax = (I — A) x = 0. Then the square lambda-matrix (I — A), which is the characteristic matrix of A (see 1.8), must be singular; i.e. the determinant  if x is not to vanish. This important equation is called the characteristic equation. If A (which is necessarily square) is of order n, then clearly the characteristic equation may be written   The n roots of this equation, say  are called eigenvalues. In what follows, we shall now regard 1,…, n as all different. An alternative formulation of the characteristic function is evidently  and it is to be observed that the two formulations imply, inter alia,  and  where Theorems II and III of 1.22 have been used. Let us write  then from (4),  so that if we regard 1 as typical of all the roots,  since all the roots differ. Now by the usual rule for differentiation of determinants,  is linear and homogeneous in the first minors of{ gd}(). Since, typically,  it follows that not all the first minors of  vanish, so that it is simply degenerate. For the same reason , the adjugate, is not null, and so has unit rank, as shown below. Since  vanishes but at least one first minor does not, there must be n — 1 independent columns, the remaining column being expressible uniquely in terms of the independent columns. This means that there will be a vector x1, called an eigenvector, such that  and x1 is uniquely determined, apart from an arbitrary scalar multiplier; that is, the ratios of the elements of x1 to each other are uniquely determined. Similarly, apart from a scalar multiplier, there will be a unique row vector  such that  It is readily shown that the adjugate  is proportional to the unit rank product . For suppose ; then  Postmultiply this by any column p such that the scalar product ; then  Since the vector x1 is unique to a scalar multiplier, we may identify  with x1 and similarly  with . If we revert to the original problem, the solution of Ax = x, we now see that there are just n eigenvalues s and that correspondingly there are just n vectors xs; i.e. we have n equations  We can combine them all into the single equation  or more briefly AX = X where X is ow the square matrix made up of the n column vectors xs, and  is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues; and our problem is now to find the matrices X and  for the given A. We may not one further point. Let d be an arbitrary diagonal matrix; then it will permute with the diagonal matrix  Postmultiply (7) by d; then  showing that Xd is a solution of (7). This expresses the fact that the columns of X are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, since in Xd, x1 is multiplied by the scalar d1 and so on. If (7) is premultiplied by A, we have A(AX) = (AX)  and AX is apparently an alternative solution for X. But since AX = X{gd} it is X postmultiplied by a diagonal matrix, as before, except that here the diagonal matrix is not arbitrary. The matrix equation   arises perhaps most commonly in the study of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of an undamped mechanical system having n degrees of freedom. The matrix A derives from the mechanical properties (mass and stiffness) of the system; s then determines the square of a natural frequency, and xs the corresponding mode of distortion. However, the amplitude is not determined; xs is arbitrary to a scalar multiplier. In this sense an arbitrary multiplier ds can be regarded as an amplitude. Because of its importance in vibration problems, the matrix X, which is the array of the individual eigenvectors xs, is usually spoken of as the modal matrix, even when the problem from which it derives is not a dynamical one. Similarly{ gd}in vibration problems is a diagonal matrix of squares of natural frequencies and thus defines the frequency spectrum of the system; accordingly it is referred to generally as the spectral matrix. We may readily show that the matrix X is non-singular. for if it is not, let us first suppose it to be simply degenerate. Then there will be a vector p, unique apart from a scalar factor, such that Xp = 0. But in that case premultiplication by A gives 0 = AXp = Xp so that p provides a relation different from p between the columns of X, which is impossible. Similarly, if X were doubly degenerate we could have only two vectors p satisfying Xp = 0, but each of these would give rise to other different vectors p. Hence X is non-singular. We may accordingly write (7) as  and A,  are equivalent matrices. If , then B is said to be derived from A by a similar transformation. This type of transformation is of great importance. For example, if  then  where  is the diagonal matrix of the squares of the eigenvalues. Similarly  and more generally  where P(A) is any polynomial in the matrix A.  We now revert briefly to Equations (2) and (3) in order to define the companion matrix C of  (). This is  Condensation of  shows that  so that the eigenvalues of A and C are the same. We shall give an example of the utility of (10) later (2.9). 1.17 THE CAYLEY-HAMILTON THEOREM This important theorem states that any square matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation. First, suppose as above that the eigenvalues are all distinct; then in view of(1.16.9) we may write the polynomial  (A) as  Now the diagonal matrix  has for diagonal elements  all of which vanish; i.e.  is null. Hence  (A) = 0, which is the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The equation is true even when the eigenvalues are not all different. For we know that in general  where  is the adjugate of (I — A). Since both  and{ gd}() I are lambda-matrices, we amy write them as polynomials in  with matrix coefficients; let us write the equation as  Then on multiplying out and identifying coefficients of , we have   Premultiply the first of these relations by , the second by , etc. and add: the result is  (A) = 0. Equations (1.16.3) and (1.16.4) show that the characteristic equation may be written in the alternative forms  It follows that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem  can be written in the alternative form, in which for consistency each factor has been multiplied by -1,  It will be observed that, with eigenvalues all different, each of these matrices has degeneracy 1, the product of all n factors having degeneracy n: i.e. it is null; this is an illustration of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (Theorem XII of 1.22). Since  (A) vanishes, so also do , etc. it follows that any power n or more of A, or any polynomial degree of n or more in A, can be expressed as a polynomial in A of degree n — 1. Furthermore, if A is non-singular,  may be expressed as a polynomial of degree n — 1 in A, and therefore also  and higher negative powers. Examples of the utility of this theorem will appear later. 1.18 SYLVESTER'S EXPANSION THEOREM We revert to Equation (1.16.9) and write , to conform with the notation for the adjugate of X. Then  Now P(A) is the diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are  in succession. Once again we here assume the eigenvalues s to be all different. We now write   so that each square matrix is null except for a unit in the appropriate diagonal position. In terms of the isolating vector ei this may be written  and if P(A) is expanded in this way, the first term, which is typical will be  The square matrices on the right of these equations are all of unit rank; we may write the last as  where x1 is the first column of X, and  the first row of . We thus establish Sylvester's theorem for the expansion of P(A), viz.  where  The unit rank matrices  which are known as the constituent matrices of A, have interesting and important properties. Thus:(i) As has been noted earlier, in 1.16  is proportional to , where  is the adjugate of (I — A). (ii) We defined  as , hence  This equation requires, for all the rows  and columns   Hence  since the inner product (scalar) is unit. Hence in general  On account of this property,  is said to be idempotent. (iii) We have also  since the inner product vanishes. (iv) If in Sylvester's expansion we put P(A), which is a arbitrary polynomial, equal to I, so that , then  As a simple example of the consistency of the theorem, let us write Sylvester's expansion for A as  Let us square both sides; then  and on account of the properties above  in accordance with Sylvester's theorem. 1.19 ORTHOGONALITY AND BI-ORTHOGONALITY OF THE MODAL MATRIX We consider first the eigenvalues (supposed all different) and modal matrix of a symmetric matrix A. then by (1.16.7) AX = X and on premultiplication  Transpose this; then since  we obtain  Comparison of (1) and (2) shows that  so that  permutes with , a diagonal matrix with all its diagonal elements different. Hence (see 1.9)  must also be diagonal and it then follows that  is also diagonal. Now we have seen that we can use Xd in place of X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix; and it therefore follows that  is also diagonal. Now the ith diagonal element of this product is  and we may clearly choose di to make this element unity. If this is done for all i, and we write Xn for Xd, then  so that the modal matrix Xn, chosen in this way, is orthogonal and we say that Xn is the normalised for of the modal matrix. Next consider the more general case when A is not symmetric, but is expressed as the product of two symmetric factors. Such factorisation is always possible, in a number of ways; for example, since AX = XA then  so that A has been factorised into two symmetric matrices; however, this particular factorisation presupposes a knowledge of X and . Suppose instead that we can write A as  where B, C are symmetric; then we have  or BX = CX. Dynamical problems frequently arise in this form directly. Now as before, if we premultiply by  and transpose, since  and   so that  permutes with  and is thus diagonal, whence it follows that  is diagonal also. Clearly we cannot normalise X in this case to make both  and  unit matrices; we say therefore that in this case X is bi-orthogonal or has a generalised orthogonal form. We may pursue the matter a little further, however. If as previously we write Xd for X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix, then we obtain  as diagonal matrices. Now the ith diagonal element of    where the bracketed term is the quadratic form obtained from C with the ith eigenvector xi. This quadratic form is not, as previously, a sum of squares; but provided it is not zero we could choose di to make the element unity, when we should have (with X for Xd)  On account of the properties established here, it is usual to say that the modes of a system are orthogonal to each other. 1.20 CANONICAL FORMS OBTAINED BY SIMILAR TRANSFORMATION We consider a matrix A, which for the moment we regard as having distinct eigenvalues. We have seen (1.12) that by elementary operations we can perform an equivalent transformation C = PAQ and C has a special canonical form, either the unit matrix or containing a diagonal unit submatrix. Let us now impose the restriction that whenever we perform an elementary postmultiplying operation to make up Q, we premultiply by the inverse operation to make up P, so that . In this case, we cannot reduce C to a diagonal matrix of units, since evidently . However, a simple and powerful canonical form is obtainable. The matrix A has the characteristic matrix (I — A). If this is premultiplied by  and postmultiplied by Q, then  so that A and  have the same eigenvalues. In particular, if we identify Q with the modal matrix X, then  by (1.16.8). Hence, as is otherwise obvious from the derivation of (1.16.8), the eigenvalues of A are given directly by , etc. In this case, therefore, we may regard  as the simple canonical form for a matrix having distinct eigenvalues. Note that if  and  then  so that, if X is the modal matrix of A, QX is the modal matrix of B. The great majority of mechanical problems give rise to matrices having distinct eigenvalues; however, problems involving equal eigenvalues are by no means unknown. For example, a rigid body may have some of its motions constrained by springs, but two (or more) unconstrained; it will then have two (or more) equal zero frequencies. The canonical form obtained by a similar transformation of a matrix having equal eigenvalues, when reduced to its simplest form, has the eigenvalues in the principal diagonal, with equal eigenvalues in groups; elsewhere the matrix is null except that there may be units in the superdiagonal. Thus, for example, a matrix of order 6 having three equal eigenvalues{ ga}, two equal eigenvalues{ gb}, and an unrepeated eigenvalue{ gg}, would have as its canonical form  where each x may be zero or unity; it occurs only within the submatrices containing groups of equal eigenvalues. C is sometimes called the Jordan canonical form and a submatrix such as  is known as a Jordan block. If in C a unit occurs at a position x, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation. This is readily proved as follows. Suppose we wish to remove the unit from the superdiagonal in the matrix   by means of a similar transformation; we can write the most general transformation matrix as  Then  and if both off-diagonal elements are to vanish, then  Provided  we may satisfy (4) and : for example, if we choose . Then  However, if  then the only solution of(4) is c = d = 0 when ad — bc vanishes, so that  does not exist. Hence, if a unit exists (it may not) in the superdiagonal element adjacent to two equal eigenvalues, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation. The reason for the existence or absence of a unit in the superdiagonal is easy to see. Suppose C in (3) is derived by a similar transformation from a matrix A, to which it is therefore equivalent. Then if I-A is simply degenerate when  ={ga}so also is I — C. There must in consequence be two units in the top two places of the superdiagonal, for without them I — C would have three null rows and three null columns, and so be triply degenerate. With two units present, only the first column and third row are null, so that I — C is simply degenerate as required. Evidently the introduction of a unit reduces the degeneracy of I — C by unity. It is clear from the derivation of the canonical form that it is conventional, but not necessary, to put equal eigenvalues in groups, and to put units in the superdiagonal. In a practical case, we might find an intermediate form for the matrix C of (3) to be (we shall discuss the meaning of x and y)   Now suppose , and therefore  to be simply degenerate when  Then  must also be simply degenerate. This requires that either x or y is nonzero, the other being zero; only so does the matrix have only one null column and row. Suppose x is zero, so that the second row and fifth column are null. Then y must not vanish. Now, by further operations of type I (i, j) we can bring the two roots into adjacent places in the diagonal, when -y will move to the infradiagonal and a zero, replacing x, will appear in the superdiagonal. A similar transformation of the submatrix then gives  so that, so far as  is concerned, we have arrived at the conventional canonical form. The conventional form is generally convenient; it is useful to have equal eigenvalues in groups and to the use superdiagonal; but in particular cases it may be well to use a nonzero quantity other than a unit in the superdiagonal. For example, if the eigenvalues are numerically small, a unit could dominate the spectral matrix; or if they are very large, a unit could be of the order of the errors in the computation. It would then be better to choose a quantity of the order of magnitude of the repeated eigenvalue, or even the eigenvalue itself, provided this is not zero. 1.21 SOME REMARKS ON EQUAL EIGENVALUES We have already remarked that the case of equal or confluent eigenvalues is not common in practical dynamical problems; however, when it occurs, it can cause difficulties. We shall not attempt to deal with the full problem of multiple equal eigenvalues; it will be sufficient in general to consider the case of two equal roots 1 = 2 as typical. Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult (a) Extension of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem In 1.17 we showed that a matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation, i.e.  irrespective of the nature of the eigenvalues. Now when , the characteristic matrix (I — A) may be simply or doubly  degenerate, according to the nature of its canonical form  If it is simply degenerate (i.e. its canonical form includes a unit in the superdiagonal) then  (A) = 0 is in fact the vanishing polynomial in A of lowest degree. But if it is doubly degenerate, there is a reduced characteristic equation  being one degree lower than . Consider the equation  where  is the adjugate of ( if for  ( is doubly degenerate  is null, since all first minors of (I — A) vanish. Accordingly,  must have the factor ( —  in each element, while  () has two such factors. If we cancel one factor from both sides, we can write  and then, as before, we can prove that . An alternative expression is evidently  where the first factor is doubly degenerate; the remainder are simply degenerate, giving as before a total degeneracy n. But if the first factor is simply degenerate, it must appear twice. We may illustrate this with a simple numerical case. Let  Put  = 2 and  in the characteristic matrix  then  since by inspection it is doubly degenerate. Also   which is simply degenerate; the sum of the columns vanishes, but first minors do not. By inspection  satisfying the reduced characteristic equation. However, when we put   in the characteristic matrix , we obtain  both of which are simply degenerate; it is readily checked that  which satisfies the full characteristic equation. If a reduced characteristic equation exists, so that , then …also vanish; and, as in 1.1, we may now express powers of A or polynomials in A as polynomials in A of degree one less than that of . (b) Nature of modal matrix We now turn to the confluent form of Equation (1.16.7), viz. AX = XA, and we shall deal with this by using the example of the numerical matrices A and B above. By inspection of (3) we can see that a column vector xi postmultiplying (2I — A) to give a null result must be such that  vanishes; two obvious vectors achieving this are{ 1,2,4) and{ 1,0,— 1}. Also if (I — A) is postmultiplied by{ 1,1,1}it vanishes. Hence we may write (8) as  so that, in this case (two equal roots and double degeneracy of the characteristic matrix), the form of (8) is unaltered. However, it should be noted that, while the first two columns of X are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, they are also obviously arbitrary to any linear combination; i.e. we may postmultiply the equation by a matrix   in which  and  are arbitrary except that D must be non-singular. The leading second-order submatrix of D corresponds to the scalar submatrix in A and therefore permutes with it, so that as before  and XD is a solution of (8). Now consider the matrix B, which yields two equal eigenvalues but simple degeneracy. Since 2I — B and I — B are both simply degenerate we can find only one vector for each to satisfy ; they are respectively (see (6)){1,2,4}and{ 1.1.1}. No other vector (apart from scalar multiplies) satisfies the equation. It follows that we cannot make up a square matrix X of eigenvectors to satisfy (8); for this reason the matrix B is said to be defective. However, we may note that{ 1.2.4}and{ 1.1.1}are the first and third columns of the modal matrix X appropriate to A. If we try this X for B we find that we obtain L or  where  is now the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues with the addition of a unit in the top superdiagonal place. Evidently A is the canonical form of A, and  that of the defective matrix B. In this latter case, a postmultiplying non-singular matrix analogous to(9) which will permute with  is  where  and  are otherwise arbitrary. Then  satisfies (10). We may note that, for both the matrices A and B,  we may therefore construct the canonical forms directly from   We now revert to (10); if for convenience we denote the columns of X by  respectively, then as we have said above, only x1 and x3 are eigenvectors; they make  and  vanish, and are each unique to a scalar multiplier. We now examine the origins of , which in relation to B we call an auxiliary vector. In (10) we find  Premultiplication of this by (2I — B) yields  Accordingly, postmultiplication by the auxiliary vector  annihilates , in fact, since  is doubly degenerate, there will be two linearly independent postmultiplying vectors which annihilate it, separately or in linear combinations. We can, and indeed must, choose x1 as one of these, for sine  vanishes, so evidently does ; and then  is the other. We might have anticipated this result from Equations (5) and (7). I (5) the doubly degenerate matrix (2I -A) is annihilated by two linearly independent eigenvectors and the simply degenerate (I — A) by the third. In (7),  is doubly degenerate and so corresponds with (2I — A); however, in this case one eigenvector and one auxiliary vector emerge. It is now clear that, to make up X, we require (i) an eigenvector x1 satisfying  (ii) an auxiliary vector  satisfying  (iii) an eigenvector x3 satisfying  In the numerical example (10),  and postmultiplication by x1 ={1,2,4}makes both vanish; postmultiplication by  ={1,0, -1}annihilates the second but not the first; the product yields — x1. There is one further point of importance:  is not unique, but contains an arbitrary element. As we have seen,  is satisfied by two linearly independent vectors (in our example,{1,2,4}and{ 1,0, -1}and therefore by any linear combinations of them. One is chosen to be x1, satisfying (2I — B) x = 0; the other , is another arbitrary combination. However, it must satisfy  so that if x1 is multiplied by a scalar d1 so also is ; which is why (11) contains  equal elements . But the equation is also satisfied by  so that in our example  with  arbitrary. This result is evidently generally true. As a dynamical example, perhaps the commonest practical problem leading to a double eigenvalue with simple degeneracy is that of critical damping. For example, the equation of motion of a mass constrained by a spring and dashpot is, in the well-known standard form,  Here we shall consider  as fixed and  as a variable (in practice, a variable spring stiffness) and for convenience we shall write  for ; this  is a variable parameter, which may be positive or negative: in the latter case, the motion is a damped oscillation. If x is proportional to expt, we have to satisfy  and for  we therefore have two different roots: either two real roots or a conjugate complex pair. However, for  (the critical damping case) the two roots coalesce into a repeated (real) root,  =  If we write v for x, the equation of motion may be written as the first-order pair  or, when{ x, v}is proportional to expt,  This requires  Giving of course the eigenvalues  for each of which  is simply degenerate. In the critical case, when{ ge}vanishes, we have two equal eigenvalues -{gm}, but I — B(0) is still simply degenerate; thus  and so the column  makes this vanish. Squaring it, we obtain a null matrix, so that  is satisfied by two linearly independent arbitrary columns. As we have seen, one of them must be  the most general form of the other is . Choosing  we find Equation (13) to be, in this case,  with the spectral matrix (on the right) in the standard canonical form for a defective matrix. There is a further interpretation of this which is of great importance. With  general, we may write the eigenvectors corresponding to ,  respectively; hence the operation  and  is converted to the standard canonical form for matrices with distinct eigenvalues. However, this similar transformation fails when : the two columns of X(O) become identical, so that its reciprocal becomes infinite. However, if we postmultiply  by a matrix which in effect sums and differences the columns, thus:  then a similar transformation  yields  as follows:  i.e. a quasi-canonical form: it is to be remembered that the standard canonical forms are conventional, but not unique. The two matrices  and  are both equivalent to  and to each other; they are each derived from  by a similar transformation. But the first is possible only for , while the second becomes a canonical form appropriate to a defective matrix only for  This example shows that the auxiliary vector{ 0,1}is in effect the differential with respect to  of the two confluent vectors  and . (c) Extension of Sylvester's expansion We come finally to the confluent form of Sylvester's expansion for any polynomial, and again we use the matrices A and B as exemplifying the  general case; however, for greater generality we shall write the repeated roots as  the unrepeated root as  and shall replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by r. Them, treating A first, we have as in 1.18  The expansion can then proceed as before, and we obtain  where  are unit rank matrices. The case of B, involving a double root with simple degeneracy, is a little more complicated. In succession, we find  Now P ( is the polynomial in   which on differentiation gives  We can evidently construct corresponding polynomials in the matrices B and , and in view of(13) they will be connected by  in (17), the first column of X is proportion to . Using (15), we may expand  in the form  Accordingly, if we now proceed (exactly as in 1.18) to premultiply (17) by X and postmultiply by  (; the first row of  is proportional to r) we obtain  Comparison with (14) shows that we have now added a new term , which derives from the element r in the superdiagonal of the canonical form. This also is a square matrix of unit rank, and z12 evidently has the properties   In fact, the above equations, and the properties of the matrices  discussed in 1.18, are all contained in the general result  on evaluation of the inner products. Equation (18) is the confluent form of Sylvester's expansion for the case of two equal eigenvalues which give only simple degeneracy to the characteristic matrix. As an example of its consistency, if we put P(B) = I, giving  then as before  while if P(B) = B, then  If we multiply (21) and (22) the result repeats (22) in view of the properties of zii and (19) above; squaring (22) yields  in accordance with(18). As an indication of Sylvester's expansion for more complicated cases, suppose we have  Then if we evaluate , it is readily found that the expansion in this case will be  Further extensions follow this pattern. Example 1 We use B as defined in (2) together with  where, in order to obtain r = 2 in , the first column of X in (10) has been halved, and the first row of YT in (12) has been doubled. These matrices satisfy . Suppose we wish to calculate B-1. Then in (18) we put  with  Then  The reader is invited to check that this is correct. 1.22 SOME MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS We append here some useful theorems and definitions: Theorem 1 — The reciprocal of the transpose of a matrix A is equal to the transpose of the reciprocal of A. For ; transpose to get . Postmultiply by the reciprocal of AT, and . We shall write . Corollary If A is symmetric, so also is A-1. Example 1 If  Also  Theorem II — The trace of a matrix, which is the sum of the elements in the principal diagonal, equals the sum of the eigenvalues. If the determinant  of order n is expanded in the usual way, the first product is  times its cofactor, which is similar to  but of order — 1. All other products are evidently of degree n — 2 in  at most. By progressive expansion of the diagonal minors it therefore appears that the two leading terms in the full expansion are  Now if we write the determinant as  the leading terms are  Hence  Example II Let  and on expansion   Then  Theorem III — The product of the eigenvalues of A is . In  put . Then . Hence if an eigenvalue of A is zero, A is singular; and conversely if , then one or more eigenvalues are zero. Example III If A is the matrix in Example II, then  Theorem IV — If a scalar  is added to each principal diagonal element of A, the eigenvalues of A are each increased by . This is immediately obvious from the identity  The sum of the eigenvalues, and tr A, are each increased by  Example IV Let us add -3 to each diagonal element of the matrix A in Examples II and III; we obtain  and . Hence, compared with Example I, the eigenvalues have each been reduced by  and . Theorem V — Any matrix can be expressed as the product of two symmetric matrices. The case in which A is non-defective has already been treated in 1.19, so that here we must consider the defective case. We write  Suppose we have a Jordan block or blocks such as   in . If this is premultiplied and postmultiplied by the reversing matrix Js, then . Now let K be the unit matrix, except that wherever a block  occurs in , the corresponding Is is replaced by Js in K. Then  We now revert to (1), postmultiply by  and use (2):  on use of the transpose of (1). Now (3) shows that AXKXT equals its own transpose and so is symmetric, says S1. Also XKXT is symmetric, says S2. Thus  is expressible as the product of two symmetric matrices. If we put  and hence K = I, the two factors in (4) reduce to those given in 1.19. This establishes that such factorisation is always possible. A general numerical procedure, not involving X, , is given later in 2.10.3. Example V (a) Non-defective matrix — let A be as defined in (1.21.1). Then  assumes the numerical values  In this case  and  The reader may check that . (b) Defective matrix — we use B as defined in (1.21.2). Then  takes the numerical values   X being the same as in case(a). Also if  then  while  and again the reader may check that the product of the symmetric matrices . Theorem VI — AT can be obtained from A by a similar transformation. This has been proved incidentally above;(3) may be written  Example VI We use the matrix B of Example V(b) above. Then  Theorem VII — If A is any matrix of order (n × p) and B any matrix of order (p × n) where , then the eigenvalues of AB are those of BA plus n — p zeros. Consider the matrix product   where the matrices are square and of order N = n + p, appropriately partitioned. If we take determinants and note that  we have  In reverse order, we find  so that  and hence It follows that the zeros of  also make  vanish and that  must also have n — p roots  = 0. This last is otherwise obvious; A has only p columns, so that AB, of order (n × n), has at most p linearly independent columns; i.e. it is of rank p at most, and so must have at least n — p zero eigenvalues. If A and B are square, and one at least(say B) is non-singular, this result may be obtained very simply from the identity.  Corollary If A, B an C are matrices of order n × p, p × q and q × n respectively, the nonzero eigenvalues of ABC (n × n), CAB (q × q) and BCA (p × p) are identical. (N.B. if n = p = q, this corollary applies only to the products ABC, CAB and BCA and not to BAC, etc.; i.e cyclic permutation only is permitted.) Example VII (a)   Here,  The reader will verify that AB is of rank 1 with spectral and modal matrices  while BA is of rank 2 with  The eigenvalues of AB and BA are thus 0, 0 and -7. It will be noted that trBA = tr AB = -7 and that Theorem VII applies regardless of the fact that rank  rank BA. (b)  Here  each product being of unit rank. The reader will verify that the spectral and modal matrices are (i) For ABC:  (ii) For CAB:  (iii) For BCA:   The non-zero eigenvalue, 47, is common to all products, as indicated by Theorem VII. Theorem VIII — If, in the eigenvalue problem  the matrices B, C are both real and symmetric, and if further C is pos. def. and B non-neg. def., then all eigenvalues are real, finite and non-negative. In (8) write ; multiply out and separate real and imaginary parts. Two real equations result:  If these equations are respectively premultiplied by  and subtracted, then since B, C are symmetric, the left-hand side vanishes, and  Since x is not null and C is pos. def., the bracketed term is positive; hence{ go}= 0 and  is real. Equation (8) is now  and since the bracketed term is real, so also is x. Finally,  and with the given conditions  is therefore real, finite, and non-negative. I B, C are both pos. def.,  is real, finite, an positive. Corollaries (i) The eigenvalues of a real, symmetric matrix A are all real and finite, and the eigenvectors are real. This follows from the theorem by putting B = A, C = I. (ii) The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are all real. The relevant equation may be written  which yields the two real equations  Premultiply the first by qT and the second by pT. Since B is symmetric, the left-hand sides are equal, an since C is skew-symmetric, its quadratic form vanishes (by transposition ). Subtraction of the two equations therefore yields   (iii) The non-zero eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are all imaginary. Here we premultiply the first of Equations (10) by  and the second by . Now, since B is skew-symmetric it disappears from the equations, while C is now symmetric, so that the right-hand sides are equal and opposite. Addition then gives  Theorem IX — If a matrix A and its inverse A-1 are known, then if a unit rank matrix is added to A, the inverse of the new matrix may be written down. Let us write the unit rank matrix as  Then  Hence  To prove this, we merely multiply out the product  which gives I. Equation (11) is an example of the ""modification formula"" generally ascribed to Householder (3). (Householder's formula relates to the more general case where a matrix of rank  is added to A. The additional, modifying, matrix may be written CRT with C of order (n × p) and RT of order (p × n). Then with  an analogy with Equation (11). The reader might verify this useful formula in which it is evident that the inverse of a matrix of order n is obtained in terms of that of a matrix of smaller order). Examples of the use of this theorem are given in 2.2.3. Theorem X — If A is real and symmetric, it cannot be defective. For suppose it is; let us write its spectral matrix  with a Jordan block  as the leading submatrix of order 2 (it can be part of a larger block); x1 is the corresponding eigenvector and  the auxiliary vector. Then from the first two columns of  we have  on transposition, since A is symmetric; and   Premultiply (13) by ; then in view of(12)  In corollary (i) of Theorem VII we have shown that if A is real and symmetric, x is real; hence in (14)  and p vanishes; similarly for all other superdiagonal elements. Hence A is not defective. Corollaries (i) If A is not symmetric, but can be written as the product , where B, C are real ad symmetric, and in addition C is pos. def., then A cannot be defective. In this case,(12) becomes successively  and (13) yields  Hence as before,  We have proved in Theorem VIII that with these conditions, X is real; hence (15) implies p = 0, and as before, A is not defective. Provided only that A is real, it is always possible to find real symmetric matrices B, C satisfying CA = B (see 2.10.3). Accordingly, if A is defective, so that ,(15) requires that  must vanish. (ii) A defective matrix cannot be similarly transformed into a real symmetric matrix. For suppose we have a Jordan block as in the theorem, with , and we apply the most general transformation; we obtain  This cannot be real and symmetric: it requires c = d = 0, which violates the condition . Example X We now illustrate Equation (15). (a) No-defective matrix — we choose the matrix defined in (1.21.1), and write it here as A1. Then with , one possible numerical expression is   Here B, C are real and symmetric, and C is pos. def.; A1 has two equal eigenvalues, 2, and two eigenvectors{ 1,2,4}and{ 1,0, -1}. These give . With p — 0 these satisfy (15). (b) Defective matrix — we use the matrix defined in (1.21.2), writing it here as . A possible choice for C, B now yields  As in (a),  has two equal eigenvalues, 2, but here possesses only the one eigenvector,{1,2,4}. With this vector . This permits  in (15). Theorem XI — The eigenvalues and vectors of a complex matrix may be obtained by treating a related real matrix. Suppose  where  are all complex. There will be a conjugate relation  Write A = B + iC, with B, C real; then  These equations are contained, twice, in the single equation  Hence the real matrix  has the eigenvalues  of (16), and the corresponding eigenvectors  Example XI Let   Then the numerical form of (12) is  so that the eigenvalues and vectors of A are 1 — i,{-1,2 + i}and 2 + 3i,{-1,1 -i}. In the alternative form the system matrix, modal matrix and spectral matrix of (17) are, respectively,  and the reader is invited to check that these matrices satisfy (17). Theorem XII — Sylvester's Law of Degeneracy: the degeneracy of the product of two square matrices is at least as great as the degeneracy of either factor, and at most as great as the sum of the degeneracies of the factors, or the order of the matrices, whichever is less. We consider the product C = AB, where A, B have degeneracies p, q respectively. Without loss of generality we may take ; for, since the rank of a matrix is unaltered by transposition, we may consider the product either as C = AB or CT = BTAT, with the matrix of greater degeneracy on the right. We also recall the result proved in 1.12: if a matrix of rank r is multiplied by a non-singular matrix, the product has rank r. This is because the non-singular matrix may be regarded as made up of elementary operations, and these cannot change the rank of a non-vanishing minor of order r. This is a special case of Sylvester's law: the degeneracy is at least n — r and at most n — r; i.e. it is n — r. We now turn to the general case, and approach it by means of a simple example. Let A, B be standard canonical forms, with n — p, n — q consecutive units in the respective diagonals, beginning at top left, and with zeros elsewhere. Since , only the first n — q units in A are multiplied by units in B, ie.e. the product is identical with B and is of degeneracy q. Now move the units in A one place down the diagonal. The leading element in the  product now vanishes, i.e. the degeneracy is now q + 1. Proceeding in this way, we finally have all the units in A at the lower end of the diagonal, with p zeros at the top, so that the degeneracy of the product is now p + q (or, if , the product is null). This example not only illustrates Sylvester's law; it also makes the important point that the degeneracy of the product depends on the relative positions of the units, and therefore of the linearly independent columns, in the two factors. Now let A, B be general, and let the equivalent transformations which give them canonical form be PAQ, RBS, where P, Q, R, S are non-singular. Then we may write  and D has the same degeneracy as C. The matrix  will in general be fully populated; if it is appropriately partitioned, we may write (18) as  To be conformable with the first and last matrices in the triple product,  must have — p rows and n — q columns. The final matrix then shows that D has p null rows and q null columns; since , D has degeneracy q at least. This establishes the first part of the theorem. Whether or not D has greater degeneracy than q clearly depends on the number of linearly independent columns in  To examine this question, consider the submatrix  The n — p rows of this submatrix, being part of , a on-singular matrix, are necessarily linearly independent. In consequence,  must have just n — p linearly independent columns, making up a non-vanishing minor of order n — p; the other p columns are either linear combinations of some or all of the columns of the minor, or null (a special combination with all coefficients zero). First, suppose . Now  has n — q columns, the minor n — p columns: separately, a total of 2n —(p + q). But  has only n columns; hence  and the minor have at least n —(p + q) common columns, i.e.  has at least n —(p + q) linearly independent columns. The remaining p columns of  may themselves be columns of the minor, or may be linear combinations of some or all of the columns of the minor, or may be linear combinations of the n —(p + q) common columns, or may be null. At the extremes, all columns of  or n —(p + q) columns of{ ga}will be linearly independent, giving D degeneracies of q and p + q respectively; any intermediate degeneracy is clearly possible. Finally, suppose . Then, as before, at one extreme,  can contain n — q columns of the minor, which are linearly independent; at the other extreme, the minor could be wholly contained in  and  could be null, when D has degeneracy . This establishes the second part of Sylvester's theorem. Examples XII Although in a numerical case we can find the degeneracy of AB by evaluating and studying C, it is instructive to examine (18) in numerical cases. We give two examples (i) Let  Here A is of degeneracy 1, B and C each of degeneracy 2. Now by building up P and Q by elementary operations (see 1.12) we obtain  giving the canonical form for A. Similarly, for B we obtain  Inverting Q and R, we find  Hence D is given by   and D is of degeneracy 2. Note that here the submatrix  is  and we can take the first two columns as linearly independent; the third is obtained by subtracting half the first from the second. (ii) If we transfer the last column of A to the first position, we have a new matrix A; with B unchanged we then have  A is again of degeneracy 1, B of degeneracy 2; but here C is of degeneracy 3. We leave it to the reader to follow the steps of Example (i), merely noting that, in the present example,  is  with a null column in the first position. Theorem XIII — a necessary and sufficient condition that a real symmetric matrix A shall be positive definite is that all its leading discriminants shall be positive. If  is the real symmetric matrix of a quadratic form , then the determinant  is called the discriminant of the form. The leading minor discriminant of order 1 is  of order 2 is , and so on. Thus if A is to be pos. def., the theorem requires that , all i. The vector x is real and non-null but otherwise arbitrary. First, we put x = e1. then  reduced to , which must be positive if f is pos. def. Next, put  Now f reduces to  which, with  requires also that . We might proceed in this way, but a different approach is simpler. In the full expansion of f, collect together all the terms involving x1; they may be written as a perfect square, so that  where B is a quadratic form involving ,…, xn only. Now we collect all terms involving  and write them as a perfect square, and so on, so that ultimately we can write the form as   where in fact  and  while y is related to x by the triangular substitution (see (20))  and . Hence f = , so that , and  Now put xn = 0. Then f may now be written as the quadratic form of which the matrix is the leading minor of A of order b — 1, and we may deduce, corresponding to (22),  Now, by putting  we establish a similar result for  and so on, so that finally we establish that  From (21) it is clear that a necessary and sufficient condition that f shall be positive is that Di shall be positive, all i. It then follows from (23) that all the discriminants  must also be positive; this also is both necessary and sufficient. This theorem was first established by Sylvester. Theorem XIV — If two matrices A, B permute, then provided at least one is non-defective, they share the same modal matrix. Let  where C is the canonical spectral matrix  of A, and X is the modal matrix of A:X is not unique; if we have any matrix Y which permutes with C, then from (24) AXY = XCY = XYC so that we can write the modal matrix of A alternatively as XY. Now write  so that D is a similar transform of B. Then it follows from AB = BA, on use of (24) and (26), that  CD = DC. We now consider three cases. (a) The eigenvalues of A are all different. Thus A is non-defective, and C is diagonal, all the diagonal elements being different. In this case (see 1.9(3)), D must also be diagonal;(26) then shows that D is the spectral matrix of B, which thus shares the modal matrix X with A. Note that D can have equal elements (including zeros) in its diagonal. (b) A is non-defective, but has some repeated eigenvalues. Thus C is diagonal; we assume it to be in standard canonical form, i.e. it has equal eigenvalues grouped together: this only requires the columns of X to be written in appropriate order. Suppose, for example, that C has m eigenvalues{ ga}, in a submatrix of order m in the leading diagonal place: there may be similar submatrices down the diagonal. Thus C possesses a scalar submatrix  in the leading position; Equation (28)(see 1.9(3) again) now permits D to have a corresponding submatrix, also of order m, arbitrarily populated: thus D will have a block diagonal form. Now in this case D can be reduced to a standard canonical form E by a similar transformation  where Y has precisely the same block diagonal form as D; in effect, each diagonal block is resolved into its own canonical form. But in this case, Y will, like D, permute with C; thus from (25) the modal matrix of A may be written XY, while (26) and (29) require  so that B shares the modal matrix XY with A. Note that here, E need not be diagonal, so that B can be defective; but non-zero elements in the superdiagonal of E can only occur in a submatrix corresponding to a scalar submatrix in C. This establishes the theorem as stated. (c) For completeness, we look briefly at the case where A is defective. Suppose, for example, that C has the leading submatrix  then the most general submatrix of D which will permute with C1 is   where d, e, f are arbitrary. Thus D1 is in general not of standard canonical form; to make it so we must at least remove f. Now while, we can find a submatrix Y1 such that  where E1 is of standard canonical form, Y1 is not of the general form D1 and so will not permute with C1. In this case, A has the modal matrix X, B the modal matrix XY. Of course, it is possible for B to be such that f = 0, when D1 is in standard canonical form: A and B then share the modal matrix X, though both are defective. The obvious (trivial) example of this is that of a defective matrix permuting with itself. But in general, if A and B are both defective, they do not have a common modal matrix. In the light of the above, it is clear that two matrices having the same modal matrix do not necessarily permute; they will do so only if their spectral matrices permute. Corollaries (i) If A, B permute, so do powers of A, B. For example  (ii) If A, B permute, and the eigenvalues of A are all different, then B can be expressed as a polynomial in A. As in case(a) above, here  where C, D are both diagonal. Now consider the general polynomial  We can identify P(C) with D; this requires  where 1,…, n are the diagonal elements of C, and d1,…, dn those of D. The square matrix in (30) is known as an alternant: its reciprocal is discussed in Ref (P1). Equation (30) defines the coefficients  such that  which establishes the corollary. It is capable of extension, but we shall not pursue the matter here. There is a considerable literature concerning permutable matrices, see, for example, Turnbull an Aitken (4). Theorem XV — Sylvester's ""Law of Inertia""  Let a real symmetric matrix A be rendered diagonal by a congruent transformation , where B is, of course, non-singular. Then the numbers of positive, zero, and negative elements in the diagonal of  are invariant with B. The number of matrices B which diagonalise A in this manner is indefinitely large: to prove the theorem we need only show that it holds for any two. Our first choice is B = X, where X is the orthogonal modal matrix of A (being symmetrical, A cannot be defective: see Theorem X) so that , the spectral matrix of A. Our other choice is , where L is the lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal and its other elements so chosen that LA is upper triangular, when , a diagonal matrix. It is a simple exercise, which we leave to the reader, to show that the process of triangulation of A by LA without row interchanges gives the elements  discussed in Theorem XIII, where the  are the principal discriminants of A and : and example (for a non-symmetric matrix) is given in  We first note that if A is of rank r, then so are ; for since , B, may be regarded as made of elementary operations  which cannot change the rank of a matrix. Thus both  and D will have n — r zeros in their diagonals, which establishes part of the theorem. To prove the remainder, we suppose the theorem does not hold; let  have p positive and r — p negative elements in addition to its n — r zeros, and D have q positive and r — q negative elements. Then  where, since we have introduced the negative signs, all non-zero i and are positive numbers. We begin by supposing p = q + s, where s is a positive number, so that ; and we examine the general quadratic form . If  then  These two expressions are equal for all x; subtraction yields   Let us seek a vector x such that  Now from (31), ; thus the first part of (33) provides n — p relations of the form , and the second part, q similar relations: a total of n — p + q = n — s relations. But x has n elements, so that we can find only n — s of its elements in terms of the remaining s (see  an example is given in 2.5) which are arbitrary. Thus a vector x satisfying (33) has s arbitrary elements. Now substitute (33) into (32); the RHS vanishes, and so, therefore, does the LHS. With all  positive this implies, inter alia  This, taken together with (33), gives y = 0 which in view of(31) gives x = 0. We thus have two results; x has s arbitrary elements, and x is null: these can only be reconciled if s = 0, when q = p. If we now take , a similar argument leads to the same result q = p. Since the argument does not depend on the nature of X and L, the result is generally true, and the theorem established. The invariant p is known as the index of positiveness, or simply the index, of A and its quadratic form. Examples XV (a) Let  then its orthogonal matrix X is  which yields  We build up L as the product , where L1 annihilates the last three elements of the first column of A, L2 the last two elements of the second column, and L3 the last element of the third column; then   Then  and the diagonal elements of LA are those of D =  We see that both  and D have two positive and two negative elements. It may be noted that . (b) Let us add 2 to each diagonal element of A, to give . then we know (Theorem IV) that . We leave it to the reader to construct the corresponding Lo; and to show that  Thus both  and  have two positive, one zero, and one negative element. Since Ao is singular, so is  which is shown by the null row. 2"
ACA ACA-F9V-001 -9.77 "1 Introduction: linguistic forms and functions The functions of language The analysis of discourse is, necessarily, the analysis of language in use. As such, it cannot be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent of the purposes or functions which those forms are designed to serve in human affairs. While some linguists may concentrate on determining the formal properties of a language, the discourse analyst is committed to an investigation of what that language is used for. While the formal approach has a long tradition, manifested in innumerable volumes of grammar, the functional approach is less well documented. Attempts to provide even a general set of labels for the principal functions of language have resulted in vague, and often confusing, terminology. We will adopt only two terms to describe the major functions of language and emphasise that this division is an analytic convenience. It would be unlikely that, on any occasion, a natural language utterance would be used to fulfil only one function, to the total exclusion of the other. That function which language serves in the expression of ‘content’ we will describe as transactional,and that function involved in expressing social relations and personal attitudes we will describe as interactional. Our distinction, ‘transactional /interactional’, stands in general correspondence to the functional dichotomies —‘representative /expressive’, found in Bühler (1934), ‘referential /emotive’(Jakobson, 1960), ‘ideational /interpersonal’(Halliday, 1970b) and ‘descriptive /social-expressive’(Lyons, 1977), The transactional view Linguists and linguistic philosophers tend to adopt a limited approach to the functions of language in society. While they  frequently acknowledge that language may be used to perform many communicative functions, they nonetheless make the general assumption that the most important function is the communication of information. Thus Lyons (1977: 32) observes that the notion of communication is readily used ‘of feelings, moods and attitudes’ but suggests that he will be primarily interested in ‘the intentional transmission of factual, or propositional, information’. Similarly Bennett (1976: 5) remarks ‘it seems likely that communication is primarily a matter of a speaker's seeking either to inform a hearer of something or to enjoin some action upon him’. The value of the use of language to transmit information is well embedded in our cultural mythology. We all believe that it is the faculty of language which has enabled the human race to develop diverse cultures, each with its distinctive social customs, religious observances, laws, oral traditions, patterns of trading, and so on. We all believe, moreover, that it is the acquisition of written language which has permitted the development within some of these cultures of philosophy, science and literature (see Goody, 1977). We all believe that this development is made possible by the ability to transfer information through the use of language, which enables man to utilise the knowledge of his forebears, and the knowledge of other men in other cultures. We shall call the language which is used to convey ‘factual or propositional information’primarily transactional language. In primarily transactional language we assume that what the speaker (or writer) has primarily in mind is the efficient transference of information. Language used in such a situation is primarily ‘message oriented’. It is important that the recipient gets the informative detail correct. Thus if a policeman gives directions to a traveller, a doctor tells a nurse how to administer medicine to a patient, a householder puts in an insurance claim, a shop assistant explains the relative merits of two types of knitting wool, or a scientist describes an experiment, in each case it matters that the speaker should make what he says (or writes) clear. There will be unfortunate (even disastrous) consequences in the real world if the message is not properly understood by the recipient. The interactional view Whereas linguists, philosophers of language and psycho-linguists  have, in general, paid particular attention to the use of language for the transmission of ‘factual or propositional information’, sociologists and sociolinguists have been particularly concerned with the use of language to establish and maintain social relationships. In sociological and anthropological literature the phatic use of language has been frequently commented on — particularly the conventional use of language to open talk-exchanges and to close them. Conversational analysts have been particularly concerned with the use of language to negotiate role-relationships, peer-solidarity, the exchange of turns in a conversation, the saving of face of both speaker and hearer (cf. Labov, 1972a; Brown and Levinson, 1978; Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974; Lakoff, 1973). It is clearly the case that a great deal of everyday human interaction is characterised by the primarily interpersonal rather than the primarily transactional use of language. When two strangers are standing shivering at a bus-stop in an icy wind and one turns to the other and says ‘My goodness, it's cold’, it is difficult to suppose that the primary intention of the speaker is to convey information. It seems much more reasonable to suggest that the speaker is indicating a readiness to be friendly and to talk. Indeed a great deal of ordinary everyday conversation appears to consist of one individual commenting on something which is present to both him and his listener. The weather is of course the most quoted example of this in British English. However a great deal of casual conversation contains phrases and echoes of phrases which appear more to be intended as contributions to a conversation than to be taken as instances of information-giving. Thus a woman on a bus describing the way a mutual friend has been behaving, getting out of bed too soon after an operation, concludes her turn in the conversation by saying Aye, she's an awfy woman. (awfy = Sc awful) This might be taken as an informative summary. Her neighbour then says reflectively (having been supportively uttering aye, aye throughout the first speaker's turn): Aye, she's an awfy woman. Pirsig (1976: 313)remarks of such a conversation: ‘the conversation's pace intrigues me. It isn't intended to go anywhere, just fill  the time of day…on and on and on with no point or purpose other than to fill the time, like the rocking of a chair.’ What seems to be primarily at issue here is the sharing of a common point of view. Brown & Levinson point out the importance for social relationships of establishing common ground and agreeing on points of view, and illustrate the lengths to which speakers in different cultures will go to maintain an appearance of agreement, and they remark ‘agreement may also be stressed by repeating part or all of what the preceding speaker has said’(1978:117) Whereas, as we shall note, written language is, in general, used for primarily transactional purposes, it is possible to find written genres whose purpose is not primarily to inform but to maintain social relationships-'thank you' letters, love letters, games of consequences, etc. Spoken and written language Manner of production From the point of view of production, it is clear that spoken and written language make somewhat different demands on language-producers. The speaker has available to him the full range of ‘voice quality’ effects (as well as facial expression, postural and gestural systems). Armed with these he can always override the effect of the words he speaks. Thus the speaker who says ‘I'd really like to’, leaning forward, smiling, with a ‘warm, breathy’ voice quality, is much more likely to be interpreted as meaning what he says, than another speaker uttering the same words, leaning away, brow puckered, with a ‘sneering, nasal’voice quality. These paralinguistic cues are denied to the writer. We shall generally ignore paralinguistic features in spoken language in this book since the data we shall quote from is spoken by co-operative adults who are not exploiting paralinguistic resources against the verbal meanings of their utterances but are, rather, using them to reinforce the meaning. Not only is the speaker controlling the production of communicative systems which are different from those controlled by the writer, he is also processing that production under circumstances which are considerably more demanding. The speaker must monitor what it is that he has just said, and determine whether it  matches his intentions, while he is uttering his current phrase and monitoring that, and simultaneously planning his next utterance and fitting that into the overall pattern of what he wants to say and monitoring, moreover, not only his own performance but its reception by his hearer. He has no permanent record of what he has said earlier, and only under unusual circumstances does he have notes which remind him what he wants to say next. The writer, on the contrary, may look over what he has already written, pause between each word with no fear of his interlocutor interrupting him, take his time in choosing a particular word, even looking it up in the dictionary if necessary, check his progress with his notes, reorder what he has written, and even change his mind about what he wants to say. Whereas the speaker is under considerable pressure to keep on talking during the period allotted to him, the writer is characteristically under no such pressure. Whereas the speaker knows that any words which pass his lips will be heard by his interlocutor and, if they are not what he intends, he will have to undertake active, public ‘repair’, the writer can cross out and rewrite in the privacy of his study. There are, of course, advantages for the speaker. He can observe his interlocutor and, if he wishes to, modify what he is saying to make it more accessible or acceptable to his hearer. The writer has no access to immediate feedback and simply has to imagine the reader's reaction. It is interesting to observe the behaviour of individuals when given a choice of conducting a piece of business in person or in writing. Under some circumstances a face-to-face interaction is preferred but, in others, for a variety of different reasons, the individual may prefer to conduct his transaction in writing. Whereas in a spoken interaction the speaker has the advantage of being able to monitor his listener's minute-by-minute reaction to what he says, he also suffers from the disadvantage of exposing his own feelings ('leaking'; Ekman & Friesen, 1969) and of having to speak clearly and concisely and make immediate response to whichever way his interlocutor reacts. The representation of discourse: texts So far we have considered in very general terms some of the differences in the manner of production of writing and speech. Before we go on to discuss some of the ways in which the forms of  speech and writing differ, we shall consider, in the next two sections, some of the problems of representing written and spoken language. We shall place this within a general discussion of what it means to represent ‘a text’. We shall use text as a technical term, to refer to the verbal record of a communicative act. (For another approach to text cf. discussion in Chapter 6.) Written texts The notion of ‘text’ as a printed record is familiar in the study of literature. A ‘text’ may be differently presented in different editions, with different type-face, on different sizes of paper, in one or two columns, and we still assume, from one edition to the next, that the different presentations all represent the same ‘text’. It is important to consider just what it is that is ‘the same’. Minimally, the words should be the same words, presented in the same order. Where there are disputed readings of texts, editors usually feel obliged to comment on the crux; so of Hamlet's O, that this too too sullied flesh would melt (1. ii.129) Dover Wilson makes it clear that this is an interpretation, since the second Quarto gives ‘too too sallied’ and the first Folio ‘too too solid’(Dover Wilson, 1934). Even where there is no doubt about the identity of words and their correct sequence, replicating these alone does not guarantee an adequate representation of a text. Consider the following extract of dialogue from Pride and Prejudice: ‘Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.’ ‘You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.’ It is clear that more than simply reproducing the words in their correct order is required. It is necessary to replicate punctuation conventions, as well as the lineation which indicates the change of speaker. The extract reads as gobbledygook if it is read as a speech by one individual. An adequate representation of a text must assign speeches to the correct characters, sentences to the correct paragraphs, and paragraphs to the correct chapters. The author's organisation and staging of his work must be preserved. In a piece of expository prose, the author's indication of the development of the argument contributes to the reader's experience of the text. Thus titles, chapter headings, sub-divisions and sub-headings all indicate to the reader how the author intends his argument to be chunked. The detail of lineation rarely matters in expository or descriptive prose. However it clearly becomes crucial in the reproduction of poetry. The work of those seventeenth-century poets who created poems in the shape of diamonds or butterflies would be largely incomprehensible if the form were not preserved. The notion of ‘text’ reaches beyond the reproduction of printed material in some further printed form. A letter, handwritten in purple ink with many curlicues, may have its text reproduced in printed form. Similarly, neutral printed versions may be produced of handwritten shopping lists, slogans spray-painted on to hoardings, and public notices embossed on metal plates. In each case the ‘text’ will be held to have been reproduced if the words, the punctuation and, where relevant, the lineation are reproduced accurately. Where the original text exploits typographical variety, a text reproduced in one type-face may lack some of the quality of the original. An obvious example is a newspaper item which may exploit several different type-faces, different sizes of type and a particular shape of lay-out. It is interesting to observe that publishers regularly reproduce conscious manipulation of the written medium on the part of the writer. Thus Jane Austen's expression of contrast is reproduced by publishers in italics: ‘Nay,’ said Elizabeth, ‘this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. I only want to think you perfect …’ Similarly Queen Victoria's use of underlining in her handwritten journal is represented by her publishers in the printed version with an italic type-face to represent the emphasis she wishes to indicate when writing of Lord Melbourne: he gave me such a kind, and I may say,fatherly look (Thursday, 28 June 1838) Where the writer is deliberately exploiting the resources of the written medium, it seems reasonable to suggest that that manipulation constitutes part of the text. A further illustration of this is to be found in the conventions governing spelling. In general we assume that words have a standardised spelling in British English. The fact of the standardisation enables authors to manipulate idiosyncratic spelling to achieve special effects. Thus in Winnie-the-Pooh the publishers reproduce the notice outside Owl's house in one inset line, using capitals, and with the author's own spelling: PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID The point that the author makes with this particular spelling would be lost if the words were reproduced in their standard form. It might then be claimed that such a form of the text was incomplete or inadequate, because the point which the author wishes to make is no longer accessible from the written text. Indeed the importance of the correct citing of an author's spelling is regularly marked by the insertion of sic into a citation by a second author who wishes to disclaim responsibility for an aberrant spelling. We have so far been making the simplifying assumption that it is clear, in all cases, what the original text consists of. Where handwritten texts are at issue, it is often the case that the individual reproducing the text in a printed version has to make a considerable effort of interpretation to assign a value to some of the less legible words. In literature, as we have remarked already, uncertainty may give rise to cruces, to disputed texts. In letters, prescriptions, shopping lists, school essays, the reader normally pushes through a once-for-all interpretation of a text which may never be read again. It must be clear however, that a printed version of a handwritten text is, in an important sense, an interpretation. This is particularly clear in the handwritten attempts of very young children where the adult is obliged to assign each large painstakingly formed letter token to a particular type of letter, which he may then re-interpret in the light of the larger message. Thus we have before us a page with a drawing of a large animal (reported to be a lion) and a table with a goldfish bowl on it. The five-year-old writes below what might be transliterated as: 1 the lion wos the fish to ti it 2 the cat wants to get dwon the steis 3 with qwt to dsthhb thelion A possible interpretation of the text thus represented might be: The lion wants the fish, to eat it. The cat wants to get down the stairs without to disturb the lion. The transliteration of the original with qwt,in line 3, reasonably accurately represents the first letter (which might also be represented as a figure nine if nine has a straight back stroke). A more charitable and interpretive transliteration would render it as a (i.e. ‘unhatted’a with a long backstroke (a. ). We shall return to the problem of the interpretive work of the reader /listener in identifying the words which constitute the text, in the next section. Spoken texts The problems encountered with the notion of ‘text’ as the verbal record of a communicative act become a good deal more complex when we consider what is meant by spoken ‘text’. The simplest view to assume is that a tape-recording of a communicative act will preserve the ‘text’. The tape-recording may also preserve a good deal that may be extraneous to the text — coughing, chairs creaking, buses going past, the scratch of a match lighting a cigarette. We shall insist that these events do not constitute part of the text (though they may form part of the relevant context, cf. Chapter 2). In general the discourse analyst works with a tape-recording of an event, from which he then makes a written transcription, annotated according to his interests on a particular occasion — transcriptions of the sort which will appear in this book. He has to determine what constitutes the verbal event, and what form he will transcribe it in. Unless the analyst produces a fine-grained phonetic transcription (which very few people would be able to read fluently) details of accent and pronunciation are lost. In general, analysts represent speech using normal orthographic conventions. The analyst may hear an utterance which might be transcribed phonemically as /greipbritn /. Is he to render this orthographically as grape britain? Hardly. He will interpret what he hears and normalise to the  conventional orthographic form Great Britain inserting conventional word boundaries in the orthographic version which do not, of course, exist in the acoustic signal. If he hears a form /gene /, is he to render this in the orthography as gonna (which for some readers may have a peculiarly American association) or gointuh or going to? The problem is a very real one, because most speakers constantly simplify words phonetically in the stream of speech (see Brown, 1977: ch. 4). If the analyst normalises to the conventional written form, the words take on a formality and specificity which necessarily misrepresent the spoken form. Problems with representing the segmental record of the words spoken pale into insignificance compared with the problems of representing the suprasegmental record (details of intonation and rhythm). We have no standard conventions for representing the paralinguistic features of the utterance which are summarised as ‘voice quality’, yet the effect of an utterance being said kindly and sympathetically is clearly very different from the effect if it is said brutally and harshly. Similarly it is usually possible to determine from a speaker's voice his or her sex, approximate age and educational status, as well as some aspects of state of health and personality (see Abercrombie, I968; Laver, 1980). It is not customary to find any detail relating to these indexical features of the speaker in transcriptions by discourse analysts. In general, too, rhythmic and temporal features of speech are ignored in transcriptions; the rhythmic structure which appears to bind some groups of words more closely together than others, and the speeding up and slowing down of the overall pace of speech relative to the speaker's normal pace in a given speech situation, are such complex variables that we have very little idea how they are exploited in speech and to what effect (but, cf. Butterworth, 1980). It seems reasonable to suggest, though, that these variables, together with pause and intonation, perform the functions in speech that punctuation,capitalization ,italicization , paragraphing etc. perform in written language. If they constitute part of the textual record in written language, they should be included as part of the textual record in spoken language. If it is relevant to indicate Queen Victoria's underlining, then it is surely also relevant to indicate, for example, a speaker's use of high pitch and loudness to indicate emphasis. The response of most analysts to this complex problem is to present their transcriptions of the spoken text using the conventions of the written language. Thus Cicourel (1973) reproduces three utterances recorded in a classroom in the following way: 1 Ci: Like this? 2 T: Okay, yeah, all right, now… 3 Ri:Now what are we going to do? In I and 3 we have to assume that the? indicates that the utterance functions as a question — whether it is formally marked by, for instance, rising intonation in the case of I, we are not told. Similarly the status of commas in the speech of the T(eacher) is not made explicit — presumably they are to indicate pauses in the stream of speech, but it may be that they simply indicate a complex of rhythmic and intonational cues which the analyst is responding to. What must be clear in a transcript of this kind is that a great deal of interpretation by the analyst has gone on before the reader encounters this ‘data’. If the analyst chooses to italicise a word in his transcription to indicate, for example, the speaker's high pitch and increased loudness, he has performed an interpretation on the acoustic signal, an interpretation which, he has decided, is in effect equivalent to a writer's underlining of a word to indicate emphasis. There is a sense, then, in which the analyst is creating the text which others will read. In this creation of the written version of the spoken text he makes appeal to conventional modes of interpretation which, he believes, are shared by other speakers of the language. It must be further emphasised that, however objective the notion of ‘text’ may appear as we have defined it ('the verbal record of a communicative act'), the perception and interpretation of each text is essentially subjective. Different individuals pay attention to different aspects of texts. The content of the text appeals to them or fits into their experience differently. In discussing texts we idealise away from this variability of the experiencing of the text and assume what Schutz has called ‘the reciprocity of perspective’, whereby we take it for granted that readers of a text or listeners to a text share the same experience (Schutz, 1953). Clearly for a great  deal of ordinary everyday language this assumption of an amount of overlap of point of view sufficient to allow mutual comprehension is necessary. From time to time however we are brought to a halt by different interpretations of ‘the same text’. This is particularly the case when critical attention is being focused on details of spoken language which were only ever intended by the speaker as ephemeral parts, relatively unimportant, of the working-out of what he wanted to say. It seems fair to suggest that discourse analysis of spoken language is particularly prone to over-analysis. A text frequently has a much wider variety of interpretations imposed upon it by analysts studying it at their leisure, than would ever have been possible for the participants in the communicative interaction which gives rise to the ‘text’. Once the analyst has ‘created’ a written transcription from a recorded spoken version, the written text is available to him in just the way a literary text is available to the literary critic. It is important to remember, when we discuss spoken ‘texts’, the transitoriness of the original. It must be clear that our simple definition of ‘text’ as ‘the verbal record of a communicative act’requires at least two hedges: i the representation of a text which is presented for discussion may in part, particularly where the written representation of a spoken text is involved, consist of a prior analysis (hence interpretation) of a fragment of discourse by the discourse analyst presenting the text for consideration ii features of the original production of the language, for example shaky handwriting or quavering speech, are somewhat arbitrarily considered as features of the text rather than features of the context in which the language is produced. The relationship between speech and writing The view that written language and spoken language serve, in general, quite different functions in society has been forcefully propounded, hardly surprisingly, by scholars whose main interest lies in anthropology and sociology. Thus Goody & Watt (1963) and Goody (1977) suggest that analytic thinking  followed the acquisition of written language ‘since it was the setting down of speech that enabled man clearly to separate words, to manipulate their order and to develop syllogistic forms of reasoning’(Goody, 1977: 11). Goody goes on to make even larger claims about the ways in which the acquisition of writing, which permits man to reflect upon what he has thought, has permitted the development of cognitive structures which are not available to the non-literate (cf. also the views of Vygotsky, 1962). He examines the use of ‘figures of the written word’ in various cultures, particularly the ‘non-speech uses of language’which develop systems of classification like lists, formulae, tables and ‘recipes for the organisation and development of human knowledge’(1977: 17). Goody suggests that written language has two main functions: the first is the storage function which permits communication over time and space, and the second is that which ‘shifts language from the oral to the visual domain' and permits words and sentences to be examined out of their original contexts, ‘where they appear in a very different and highly ‘abstract’ context' (1977: 78). It seems reasonable to suggest that, whereas in daily life in a literate culture, we use speech largely for the establishment and maintenance of human relationships (primarily interactional use), we use written language largely for the working out of and transference of information (primarily transactional use). However, there are occasions when speech is used for the detailed transmission of factual information. It is noteworthy, then, that the recipient often writes down the details that he is told. So a doctor writes down his patient's symptoms, an architect writes down his client's requirements, Hansard records the proceedings of the British Parliament, we write down friends' addresses, telephone numbers, recipes, knitting patterns, and so on. When the recipient is not expected to write down the details, it is often the case that the speaker repeats them sometimes several times over. Consider the typical structure of a news broadcast which opens with the ‘headlines’— a set of summary statements — which are followed by a news item that consists of an expansion and repetition of the first headline, in which is embedded a comment from ‘our man on the spot’ that recapitulates the main points again, then, at the end of the broadcast, there is a repetition of the set of headlines. There is a general expectation that people will not remember detailed facts  correctly if they are only exposed to them in the spoken mode, especially if they are required to remember them over an extended period of time. This aspect of communication is obviously what written language is supremely good at, whether for the benefit of the individual in remembering the private paraphernalia of daily life, or for the benefit of nations in establishing constitutions, laws and treaties with other nations. The major differences between speech and writing derive from the fact that one is essentially transitory and the other is designed to be permanent. It is exactly this point which D. J. Enright makes in the observation that ‘Plato may once have thought more highly of speech than of writing, but I doubt he does now!’ (Review in The Sunday Times , 24 January 1982). Differences in form between written and spoken language It is not our intention here to discuss the many different forms of spoken language which can be identified even within one geographical area like Britain. Clearly there are dialectal differences, accent differences, as well as‘register’ differences depending on variables like the topic of discussion and the roles of the participants (see e.g. Trudgill, 1974 and Hudson, 1980 for discussion of these sorts of differences). There is however, one further distinction which is rarely noted, but which it is important to draw attention to here. That is the distinction between the speech of those whose language is highly influenced by long and constant Immersion in written language forms, and the speech of those whose language is relatively uninfluenced by written forms of language. It is of course the case that it is the speech of the first set whose language tends to be described in descriptions of the language (grammars), since descriptions are typically written by middle-aged people who have spent long years reading written language. In particular situations the speech of, say, an academic, particularly if he is saying something he has said or thought about before, may have a great deal in common with written language forms. For the majority of the population, even of a ‘literate’ country, spoken language will have very much less in common with the written language. This, again, is a point appreciated by Goody: ‘Some individuals spend more time with the written language than they do with the spoken. Apart from the effects on their own  personalities…what are the effects on language? How do written languages differ from spoken ones?’(1977: 124). In the discussion which follows we shall draw a simplistic distinction between spoken and written language which takes highly literate written language as the norm of written language, and the speech of those who have not spent many years exposed to written language (a set which will include most young undergraduate students) as the norm for spoken language. In 1.2.1 we discussed some of the differences in the manner of production of speech and writing, differences which often contribute significantly to characteristic forms in written language as against characteristic forms in speech. The overall effect is to produce speech which is less richly organised than written language, containing less densely packed information, but containing more interactive markers and planning ‘fillers’. The standard descriptive grammars of English (e.g. Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech & Svartvik, 1972) typically describe features of the written language, or that form of the spoken language which is highly influenced by written language. From the descriptive work of a number of scholars studying spoken language (e.g. Labov, 1972a; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975; Chafe, 1979; Ochs, 1979; Cicourel, 1981; Goffman, 1981) we can extract some (by no means all) features which characterise spoken language: a the syntax of spoken language is typically much less structured than that of written language i spoken language contains many incomplete sentences, often simply sequences ii spoken language typically contains rather little subordination iii in conversational speech, where sentential syntax can be observed, active declarative forms are normally found. In over 50 hours of recorded conversational speech, Brown, Currie and Kenworthy (1980) found very few examples of passives, it-clefts or wh-clefts. Crystal(1980) also presents some of the problems encountered in attempting to analyse spontaneous speech in terms of categories like sentence and clause  As a brief example, notice how this speaker pauses and begins each new ‘sentence’ before formally completing the previous one: it's quite nice the Grassmarket since + it's always had the antique shops but they're looking + they're sort of + em + become a bit nicer + b in written language an extensive set of metalingual markers exists to mark relationships between clauses (that complementisers,when I while temporal markers, so-called ‘logical connectors’ like besides, moreover, however, in spite of,etc.), in spoken language the largely paratactically organised chunks are related by and, but, then and, more rarely,if. The speaker is typically less explicit than the writer:I'm so tired (because)I had to walk all the way home. In written language rhetorical organisers of larger stretches of discourse appear, like firstly, more important than and in conclusion. These are rare in spoken language. c In written language, rather heavily premodified noun phrases (like that one) are quite common — it is rare in spoken language to find more than two premodifying adjectives and there is a strong tendency to structure the short chunks of speech so that only one predicate is attached to a given referent at a time (simple case-frame or one-place predicate) as in:it's a biggish cat + tabby + with torn ears,or in:old man McArthur + he was a wee chap + oh very small + and eh a beard + and he was pretty stooped . The packaging of information related to a particular referent can, in the written language, be very concentrated, as in the following news item:A man who turned into a human torch ten days ago after snoozing in his locked car while smoking his pipe has died in hospital. (Evening News (Edinburgh), 22 April 1982) d Whereas written language sentences are generally structured in subject-predicate form, in spoken language it is  quite common to find what Givo/1n (1979b) calls topic-comment structure, as in the cats + did you let them out . e in informal speech, the occurrence of passive constructions is relatively infrequent. That use of the passive in written language which allows non-attribution of agency is typically absent from conversational speech. Instead, active constructions with indeterminate group agents are noticeable, as in:Oh everything they do in Edinburgh + they do it far too slowly  f in chat about the immediate environment, the speaker may rely on (e.g.) gaze direction to supply a referent:(looking at the rain) frightful isn't it. g the speaker may replace or refine expressions as he goes along:this man + this chap she was going out with  h the speaker typically uses a good deal of rather generalised vocabulary:a lot of, got, do, thing, nice, stuff, place and things like that . i the speaker frequently repeats the same syntactic form several times over, as this fairground inspector does: I look at fire extinguishers + I look at fire exits + I look at what gangways are available + I look at electric cables what + are they properly earthed + are they properly covered  j the speaker may produce a large number of prefabricated ‘fillers’:well, erm, I think, you know, if you see what I mean, of course, and so on . Some of the typical distinctions between discourse which has been written and that which has been spoken can be seen in the following two descriptions of a rainbow. (No direct comparison is intended, since the two pieces of discourse were produced in strictly non-comparable circumstances for very different purposes.) And then, in the blowing clouds, she saw a band of faint iridescence colouring in faint shadows a portion of the hill. And forgetting, startled, she looked for the hovering colour and saw a rainbow forming itself. In one place it gleamed fiercely, and, her heart anguished with hope, she sought the shadow of iris where the bow should be. Steadily the colour gathered, mysteriously, from nowhere, it took presence upon itself, there was a faint, vast rainbow. (D. H. Lawrence,The Rainbow , chapter 16) In the first extract (I), the rich lexis and well-organised structure are indications that the writer has taken time in the construction, and possibly reconstruction after several rewritings, of the final product. There are complete sentences, containing subordinations, frequent modifications via adjectives and adverbs, and more than single predicates per referential expression. In extract (2), there are frequent pauses, often interrupting major syntactic units, repetitions, incomplete sentences, generalised vocabulary, fillers and one example of a tongue-slip. normally after + very heavy rain + or something like that + and + you're driving along the road + and + far away + you see + well + er + a series + of + stripes + + formed like a bow + an arch + + very very far away + ah + seven colours but + + I guess you hardly ever see seven it's just a + a series of + colours which + they seem to be separate but if you try to look for the separate (kAz)— colours they always seem + very hard + to separate + if you see what I mean ++ (Postgraduate student speaking informally) The speaker planning in the here-and-now, possibly threatened with his interlocutor wanting to take a turn, typically repeats himself a good deal, using the same syntactic structure, the same lexical items, using the first word that comes to mind rather than hunting for the mot juste ,filling in pauses with ‘fillers’. The overall effect is of information produced in a much less dense manner than is characteristic of written language. We must assume that the density of information packing in spoken language is appropriate for the listener to process comfortably. Most people have experienced expository prose read aloud which they have found difficult to follow in the spoken mode. Few people can extract a great deal from a lecture which is read aloud with no visual support. Goody  points out that the written form of language releases us from the linear experiential mode: ‘the fact that it takes a visual form means that one can escape from the problem of the succession of events in time, by backtracking, skipping, looking to see who-done-it before we know what it is they did. Who, except the most obsessive academic, reads a book as he hears speech? Who, except the most avant-garde of modern dramatists, attempts to write as they speak?’(1977:124). Sentence and utterance It might seem reasonable to propose that the features of spoken language outlined in the preceding section should be considered as features of utterances, and those features typical of written language as characteristic of sentences. In this convenient distinction, we can say, in a fairly non-technical way, that utterances are spoken and sentences are written and that we will apply these terms to what Lyons describes as ‘the products of ordinary language-behaviour’. In the case of the term sentence,it is important to be clear about the type of object one is referring to. Lyons makes a distinction between ‘text-sentences’ and ‘system-sentences’. He describes the latter in the following way: system-sentences never occur as the products of ordinary language-behaviour. Representations of system-sentences may of course be used in metalinguistic discussion of the structure and functions of language: and it is such representations that are customarily cited in grammatical descriptions of particular languages. (Lyons, 1977:31) Since the linguistic exemplification presented in support of our discussion throughout this book is overwhelmingly drawn from ‘ordinary language behaviour’, we shall generally employ the term ‘sentence’ in the ‘text-sentence’, and not the ‘system-sentence’sense. Although the linguist who undertakes the analysis of discourse has ultimately the same aims as a linguist who uses ‘system-sentences’ in his grammatical description of a language, there are important methodological differences involved in the two approaches. Both linguists wish to produce accurate descriptions of the particular language studied. In pursuit of this goal, the  grammarian will concentrate on a particular body of data and attempt to produce an exhaustive but economical set of rules which will account for all and only the acceptable sentences in his data. He will not normally seek to account for the mental processes involved in any language-user's production of those sentences, nor to describe the physical or social contexts in which those sentences occur. On each of these issues, concerning ‘data’, ‘rules’, ‘processes’ and ‘contexts’, the discourse analyst will take a different view. On ‘data' The grammarian's ‘data’ is inevitably the single sentence, or a set of single sentences illustrating a particular feature of the language being studied. It is also typically the case that the grammarian will have constructed the sentence or sentences he uses as examples. This procedure is not often made explicit, but an overt commitment to the constructed-data approach has recently been expressed in the following terms: I shall assume…that invented strings and certain intuitive judgements about them constitute legitimate data for linguistic research. (Gazdar, 1979: 11) In contrast, the analysis of discourse, as undertaken and exemplified in this book, is typically based on the linguistic output of someone other than the analyst. On the few occasions where constructed data is used as illustration (of a paradigm, for example, in Chapter 4), it is inevitably directed towards accounting for the range of formal options available to a speaker or writer. More typically, the discourse analyst's ‘data’ is taken from written texts or tape-recordings. It is rarely in the form of a single sentence. This type of linguistic material is sometimes described as ‘performance-data’ and may contain features such as hesitations, slips, and non-standard forms which a linguist like Chomsky (1965) believed should not have to be accounted for in the grammar of a language. Although these two views of ‘data’ differ substantially, they are not incompatible, unless they are taken in an extreme form. A discourse analyst may regularly work with extended extracts of conversational speech, for example, but he does not consider his data in isolation from the descriptions and insights provided by sentence-grammarians. It should be the case that a linguist who is  primarily interested in the analysis of discourse is, in some sense, also a sentence-grammarian. Similarly, the sentence-grammarian cannot remain immured from the discourse he encounters in his daily life. The sentence he constructs to illustrate a particular linguistic feature must, in some sense, derive from the ‘ordinary language’ of his daily life and also be acceptable in it. A dangerously extreme view of ‘relevant data’ for a discourse analyst would involve denying the admissibility of a constructed sentence as linguistic data. Another would be an analytic approach to data which did not require that there should be linguistic evidence in the data to support analytic claims. We shall return to the issue of ‘relevant data’ for discourse analysis in Chapter 2. An over-extreme view of what counts as data for the sentence-grammarian was, according to Sampson (1980), noticeable in some of the early work of generative grammarians. Chomsky gave an indication of the narrowness of view which could be taken, when, immediately before his conclusion that ‘grammar is autonomous’, he stated: Despite the undeniable interest and importance of semantic and statistical studies of language, they appear to have no direct relevance to the problem of determining or characterising the set of grammatical utterances. (Chomsky, 1957: 17) The essential problem in an extreme version of the constructed-sentence approach occurs when the resulting sentences are tested only against the linguist's introspection. This can (and occasionally did) lead to a situation in which a linguist claims that the ‘data’ he is using illustrates acceptable linguistic strings because he says it does, as a result of personal introspection, and regardless of how many voices arise in disagreement. The source of this problem, as Sampson (1980: 153) points out, is that the narrow restriction of ‘data’ to constructed sentences and personal introspection leads to a ‘non-testability’, in principle, of any claims made. One outcome of this narrow view of data is that there is a concentration on ‘artificially contrived sentences isolated from their communicative context’(see Preface to Givón (ed.), 1979). Although we shall appeal frequently, in the course of this book, to the insights of sentence grammarians, including those working within a generative framework, we shall avoid as far as possible the methodology which depends on what Lyons (I968) described as regularised, standardised and decontextualised data. Rules versus regularities A corollary to the restricted data approach found in much of Chomskyan linguistics is the importance placed on writing rules of grammar which are fixed and true 100% of the time. Just as the grammarian's ‘data’ cannot contain any variable phenomena, so the grammar must have categorial rules, and not ‘rules’which are true only some of the time. It is typical of arguments concerning the ‘correct rules’ of the language in the Chomskyan approach, and that of most other sentence-grammarians, that they are based on the presentation of ‘example’and ‘counterexample’. After all, a single (accepted) sentence, which is presented as a counterexample, can be enough to invalidate a rule of the categorial type. In this sense, the ‘rules’ of grammar appear to be treated in the same way as ‘laws’in the physical sciences. This restricts the applicability of such rules since it renders them unavailable to any linguist interested in diachronic change or synchronic variation in a language. It should be emphasised that this is an extreme version of the sentence-grammarian's view and one which is found less frequently, in contemporary linguistics, than it was fifteen years ago. The discourse analyst, with his ‘ordinary language’ data, is committed to quite a different view of the rule-governed aspects of a language. Indeed, he may wish to discuss, not ‘rules’ but regularities,simply because his data constantly exemplifies non-categorial phenomena. The regularities which the analyst describes are based on the frequency with which a particular linguistic feature occurs under certain conditions in his discourse data. If the frequency of occurrence is very high, then the phenomenon described may appear to be categorial. As Givón says: what is the communicative difference between a rule of 90% fidelity and one of 100% fidelity? In psychological terms, next to nothing. In communication, a system with go% categorial fidelity is a highly efficient system. (Givón, 1979a: 28) Yet the frequency of occurrence need not be as high as 90% to qualify as a regularity. The discourse analyst, like the experimental psychologist, is mainly interested in the level of frequency which reaches significance in perceptual terms. Thus, a regularity in discourse is a linguistic feature which occurs in a definable environment with a significant frequency. In trying to determine such  regularities, the discourse analyst will typically adopt the traditional methodology of descriptive linguistics. He will attempt to describe the linguistic forms which occur in his data, relative to the environments in which they occur. In this sense, discourse analysis is, like descriptive linguistics, a way of studying language. It may be regarded as a set of techniques, rather than a theoretically predetermined system for the writing of linguistic ‘rules’. The discourse analyst attempts to discover regularities in his data and to describe them. Product versus process The regularities which the discourse analyst describes will normally be expressed in dynamic, not static, terms. Since the data investigated is the result of ‘ordinary language behaviour’, it is likely to contain evidence of the ‘behaviour’ element. That is, unless we believe that language-users present each other with prefabricated chunks of linguistic strings (sentences), after the fashion of Swift's professors at the grand academy of Lagado (Gulliver's Travels,part 3,chapter 5), then we must assume that the data we investigate is the result of active processes. The sentence-grammarian does not in general take account of this, since his data is not connected to behaviour. His data consists of a set of objects called ‘the well-formed sentences of a language’, which can exist independently of any individual speaker of that language. We shall characterise such a view as the sentence-as-object view, and note that such sentence-objects have no producers and no receivers. Moreover, they need not be considered in terms of function, as evidenced in this statement by Chomsky (I968: 62): If we hope to understand human language and the psychological capacities on which it rests, we must first ask what it is, not how or for what purposes it is used. A less extreme, but certainly related, view of natural language sentences can also be found elsewhere in the literature which relates to discourse analysis. In this view, there are producers and receivers of sentences, or extended texts, but the analysis concentrates solely on the product, that is, the words-on-the-page. Much of the analytic work undertaken in ‘Textlinguistics’ is of this type. Typical of such an approach is the ‘cohesion’ view of the relationships between sentences in a printed text (e.g. the approach in Halliday & Hasan, 1976). In this view, cohesive ties exist between elements in connected sentences of a text in such a way that one word or phrase is linked to other words or phrases. Thus, an anaphoric element such as a pronoun is treated as a word which substitutes for, or refers back to, another word or words. Although there are claims that cohesive links in texts are used by text-producers to facilitate reading or comprehension by text-receivers (cf. Rochester & Martin 1977, 1979; Källgren, 1979), the analysis of the ‘product’, i.e. the printed text itself, does not involve any consideration of how the product is produced or how it is received. We shall describe such an approach as deriving from a text-as-product view. This view does not take account of those principles which constrain the production and those which constrain the interpretation of texts. In contrast to these two broadly defined approaches, the view taken in this book is best characterised as a discourse-as-process view. The distinction between treating discourse as ‘product’ or ‘process’has already been made by Widdowson (1979b: 71). We shall consider words, phrases and sentences which appear in the textual record of a discourse to be evidence of an attempt by a producer (speaker /writer) to communicate his message to a recipient (hearer /reader). We shall be particularly interested in discussing how a recipient might come to comprehend the producer's intended message on a particular occasion, and how the requirements of the particular recipient(s), in definable circumstances, influence the organisation of the producer's discourse. This is clearly an approach which takes the communicative function of language as its primary area of investigation and consequently seeks to describe linguistic form, not as a static object, but as a dynamic means of expressing intended meaning. There are several arguments against the static concept of language to be found in both the ‘sentence-as-object’ and ‘text-as-product’approaches. For example, Wittgenstein (1953: 132) warns that ‘the confusions that occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work’. In the course of describing how a sentence-as-object approach, based exclusively on syntactic descriptions, fails to account for a variety of sentential  structures, Kuno (1976) concludes that ‘it is time to re-examine every major syntactic constraint from a functional point of view’. Similar conclusions are expressed by Creider (1979), Givóon (1976, 1979b), Rommetveit (1974) and Tyler (1978). In criticising the text-as-product view of cohesion in text, Morgan (1979) argues that we see a link between a particular pronoun and a full noun phrase in a text because we assume the text is coherent and not because the pronoun ‘refers back’ to the noun phrase. We seek to identify the writer's intended referent for a pronoun, since a pronoun can, in effect, be used to refer to almost anything. That is, what the textual record means is determined by our interpretation of what the producer intended it to mean. The discourse analyst, then, is interested in the function or purpose of a piece of linguistic data and also in how that data is processed, both by the producer and by the receiver. It is a natural consequence that the discourse analyst will be interested in the results of psycholinguistic processing experiments in a way which is not typical of the sentence-grammarian. It also follows that the work of those sociolinguists and ethnographers who attempt to discuss language in terms of user's purposes will also be of interest. In the course of this book, we shall appeal to evidence in the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic literature which offers insights into the way in which discourse, produced in describable contexts for recognisable purposes, is processed and comprehended. On ‘context' We have constantly referred to the ‘environment’, ‘circumstances’ or context in which language is used. In Chapter 2 we shall explore the problem of specifying the relevant context. Here we simply remark that in recent years the idea that a linguistic string (a sentence) can be fully analysed without taking ‘context’ into account has been seriously questioned. If the sentence-grammarian wishes to make claims about the ‘acceptability’ of a sentence in determining whether the strings produced by his grammar are correct sentences of the language, he is implicitly appealing to contextual considerations. After all, what do we do when we are asked whether a particular string is ‘acceptable’? Do we not immediately, and quite naturally, set about constructing  some circumstances (i.e. a ‘context’) in which the sentence could be acceptably used? Any analytic approach in linguistics which involves contextual considerations, necessarily belongs to that area of language study called pragmatics. ‘Doing discourse analysis’ certainly involves ‘doing syntax and semantics’, but it primarily consists of ‘doing pragmatics’. When the principles which we have expounded in 1.3 are placed alongside Morris's definition of pragmatics as ‘the relations of signs to interpreters’(1938: 6), the connection becomes quite clear. In discourse analysis, as in pragmatics, we are concerned with what people using language are doing, and accounting for the linguistic features in the discourse as the means employed in what they are doing. In summary, the discourse analyst treats his data as the record (text) of a dynamic process in which language was used as an instrument of communication in a context by a speaker /writer to express meanings and achieve intentions (discourse). Working from this data, the analyst seeks to describe regularities in the linguistic realisations used by people to communicate those meanings and intentions."
ACA ACA-FC1-001 -9.64 "[CHANCERY DIVISION]In re A DEBTOR (NO. 784 OF 1991) 1992 April 13 Hoffmann J. Bankruptcy — Jurisdiction — Carrying on business — Debtor selling business and leaving United Kingdom more than three years before presentation of petition — No debts outstanding save for income tax liability — Whether debtor ‘carried on business’ within three years preceding petition — Jurisdiction to make bankruptcy order — Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45), s. 265(1) (c)(ii) In May 1987 the debtor, who had carried on the business of running a nursing home, sold the business as a going concern and went to live in the Canary Islands. No debts remained outstanding, apart from a tax liability in excess of £500,000. In 1988 the debtor made an offer to settle the tax liability which was not accepted, and in February 1991 the Inland Revenue presented a bankruptcy petition. The registrar in bankruptcy made an order allowing service of the petition on the debtor in the Canary Islands. On the hearing of the petition he decided that the debtor had ‘carried on business in England and Wales’ within a period of three years ending with the presentation of the petition for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) of the Insolvency Act 1986and made the order sought. On the debtor's appeal:— Held , dismissing the appeal, that there was nothing in the policy of the Insolvency Act 1986 that indicated that Parliament intended to give the words ‘carried on business’ in section 265(1) (c )(ii) of that Act a meaning different from that which they had been held to bear in section 4(1) (d ) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914; that a debtor did not cease to carry on business for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) until all the trading debts of the business had been paid; and that, accordingly, the registrar had been right in holding that since the tax liability had not been discharged the debtor was still carrying on business and that he had jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order (post, pp. 122B–E, H — 123A). Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186, H.L. (E.) applied. The following cases are referred to in the judgment: Debtor (No. 1 of 1987), In re A [1989]1 W.L.R. 271;[1989]2 All E.R. 46, C.A. Smith (A Bankrupt), In re, Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215;[1989]3 W.L.R. 1317;[1989]3 All E.R. 897, H.L. (E.) Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186;[1950]1 All E.R. 405, H.L. (E.) The following additional cases were cited in argument: Bird, In re, Ex parte the Debtor v. Inland Revenue Commissioners [1962]1 W.L.R. 686;[1962]2 All E.R. 406, C.A. M'George, Ex parte, In re Stevens (1882) 20 Ch.D. 607, C.A. Sarflax Ltd., In re [1979]Ch. 592;[1979]2 W.L.R. 202;[1979]1 All E.R. 529 APPEAL from the registrar in bankruptcy. On 11 November 1991, Mr. Registrar Pimm, pursuant to a petition presented on 1 February 1991, made a bankruptcy order against the debtor, although the debtor had not lived in England and Wales since 8 May 1987, on the basis that she was still notionally carrying on business in England and Wales within the meaning of section 265(1) (c ) of the Insolvency Act 1986 because though there were no other debts outstanding there was an unpaid tax liability of over £500,000. By a notice of appeal dated 29 November 1991 the debtor appealed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order because she had not carried on business in England or Wales within three years prior to the presentation of the petition. The facts are stated in the judgment. Richard Ritchie for the debtor. Nicholas Warren for the Inland Revenue Commissioners. HOFFMANN J. This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Registrar Pimm, which raises a question on the court's jurisdiction to make a bankruptcy order. The debtor in this case carried on business in this country running a nursing home in the course of which she incurred a tax liability in the sum of about £500,000 which remains unpaid. In January 1987 she went to live in Tenerife and on 8 May 1987 she sold the business as a going concern. There is no evidence that any debts, apart from her tax liability, remained outstanding. In 1988 she made an offer to settle the tax liability, which was not accepted, and on 1 February 1991 the Inland Revenue Commissioners presented a bankruptcy petition which came before the registrar on 11 November 1991. The sole question before him was whether there was jurisdiction under section 265 of the Insolvency Act 1986. That section sets out various grounds for jurisdiction, including the domicile, residence and physical presence of the debtor in England, but the sole ground relied on in this case is section 265(1) (c )(ii), namely, that the debtor within a period of three years ending on the date of presentation, had ‘carried on business in England and Wales.’ The debtor says that she has not carried on business in this country since 8 May 1987, the date upon which the business was sold. The Inland Revenue say that carrying on business for the purposes of this section continues until all the debts of the business incurred in the course of trade have been paid, and that includes the liability for tax. The construction which is put forward by the Commissioners is one which was adopted by the courts in respect of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, upon which section 265 of the Act of 1986 is plainly modelled. Section 4(1) (d ) of the Act of 1914 also contained various grounds of jurisdiction, including when the debtor, ‘has carried on business in England, personally or by means of an agent or manager’ within a year before the presentation of the petition. The only noticeable change in the language in the Act of 1986 is the extension of that period to three years. Section 4(1) (d ) was considered by the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186. The facts of that case were not materially different from this one. There too the only debt remaining outstanding from a business which had otherwise ceased more than a year before was a debt owed to the Inland Revenue. Lord Porter, who delivered the only speech, referred to a number of earlier cases dealing with the construction of ‘carrying on a business’ for the purposes of jurisdiction over the separate property of married women. The relevant statute in those cases had provided simply that jurisdiction should exist over a married woman ‘carrying on a trade separately from her husband.’ The question which arose in those cases was whether the cessation of trade, in the sense of ‘putting the shutters up,’ immediately deprived the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction over the married woman, or whether it continued while the trade debts remained unpaid. It will be observed that in those cases there was no statutory period after cessation of trade during which jurisdiction continued, and the court was therefore faced with a stark choice between saying that the jurisdiction ceased immediately active trade was suspended, or saying that it continued until the business had actually been wound up by payment of the debts. There was no basis upon which any intermediate position could be chosen. It is not in those circumstances surprising that the court decided in favour of the latter construction. In Theophile's case, however, the choice was not nearly so stark. There would have been less practical difficulty about saying that trade ceased when business ceased actively to be carried on, because there was a further period of a year during which a petition could be presented. Nonetheless, the House of Lords applied the same construction. The question before me today is whether Parliament, in using similar language in section 265, intended those words to bear the same meaning as those given to them by the House of Lords under the Act of 1914. The Insolvency Act 1986 is a consolidation Act only in the sense that it consolidates the Insolvency Act 1985 and some other provisions. It is an entirely new code in relation to the Bankruptcy Act 1914. The court therefore has to approach its construction on the footing that the new Act may exhibit policies and intentions which are not necessarily the same as those in the earlier Act, and which require similar words to be given different meanings from those which the courts gave them under the earlier legislation. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)[1989]1 W.L.R. 271, the Court of Appeal was concerned with the construction of a provision in the Insolvency Rules 1986 (S.I. 1986 No. 1925), rule 7.55, which provided: ‘No insolvency proceedings shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which objection is made considers that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity, and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of the court. Under a similar provision in the Bankruptcy Act 1914 it had been held that a defect in a bankruptcy notice of a kind such as could reasonably mislead the debtor was not a mere formal defect or irregularity within the meaning of that provision, and therefore rendered the notice a nullity even though it was not calculated to cause substantial injustice. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)the Court of Appeal refused to follow that approach and held that a statutory demand, which on the face of it contained a number of puzzling and perplexing statements, was nonetheless valid because the debtor knew precisely what he owed and there was no injustice in holding that his failure to pay the debt gave rise to a presumption that he was unable to pay. That approach to construction was approved by the House of Lords in In re Smith (A Bankrupt), Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215, in which Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said, at p. 238, that, in view of the changes in policy shown by the new Act, he felt justified in construing the provision of the Act of 1986 ‘as a piece of new legislation without regard to 19th century authorities or similar provisions of repealed Bankruptcy Acts.’ Those authorities show that, in approaching the language of the Act of 1986, one must pay particular attention to the purposes and policies of its own provisions and be wary of simply carrying over uncritically meanings which had been given to similar words in the earlier Act. It does not, however, mean that the language of the new Act comes to one entirely free of any of the intellectual freight which was carried by words and phrases in earlier bankruptcy or other legislation. Decisions of the court upon the meanings of phrases used in Acts of Parliament may come, in the course of time, to give them the quality of terms of art which Parliament may well be assumed to have intended them to bring with them when used in subsequent legislation. In section 265, for example, terms such as ‘domiciled,’‘personally present,’‘ordinarily resident,’ have had attributed to them, both in the context of bankruptcy and in that of civil procedure generally, a wealth of refined construction which it is difficult to suppose Parliament did not intend equally to apply when those words were used in the Act of 1986. Is there any reason why that should not apply equally to the words ‘has carried on business?’ There does not seem to me to be anything in the policy of the new Act which suggests that in this provision Parliament was intending to give those words a different meaning from those which they had been held to bear under the Act of 1914. It was suggested that the extension of the period to three years from one required the attribution of a different meaning because the Theophile construction meant that it did not really matter what the period was; as long as there was a debt, a bankruptcy petition could be presented. The effect of the outstanding debt would be to prevent the cessation of trade for the purposes of the section. That is not quite true, because the debt must, in order to found jurisdiction under section 265, be a trade debt. For the purposes simply of enabling the petitioner to rank as a creditor, the debt can, of course, be any kind of debt. It follows that the extension to three years does have significance. It enables a non-trade creditor to present a petition within three years after the last trade debt has been paid instead of within only one year. In Muir Hunter on Personal Insolvency (1991), p. 3037, at para. 3–070, it is suggested that the Theophile construction of the Act of 1914 is a somewhat artificial one, and the question is raised as to whether, under the new Act, unfettered by old case law, the long established but artificial construction will continue to be applied. It appears to me, however, that the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186 did not regard their construction as being an artificial one. They came to that conclusion on the grounds that it appeared to them to be a tenable meaning of the words and in accordance with what they thought to be the policy of the Act of 1914 as to jurisdiction. I have already said that, on the question of jurisdiction, I can discern no difference between the policy of the Act of 1914 and that of the Act of 1986, and under those circumstances I think that the registrar's decision was right and the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed with costs. Leave to appeal. Solicitors: Binks Stern; Solicitor of Inland Revenue."
ACA ACA-HRG-001 -9.65 "CHAPTER 8 Polymers in Solution 8.1 Thermodynamics of polymer solutions The interaction of long chain molecules with liquids is of considerable interest from both a practical and theoretical viewpoint. For linear and branched polymers, liquids can usually be found which will dissolve the polymer completely to form a homogeneous solution, whereas cross-linked networks will only swell when in contact with compatible liquids. In this chapter we shall deal with linear or branched polymers and treat the swelling of networks in chapter 14. When an amorphous polymer is mixed with a suitable solvent, it disperses in the solvent and behaves as though it too is a liquid. In a good solvent, classed as one which is highly compatible with the polymer, the liquid-polymer interactions expand the polymer coil, from its unperturbed dimensions, in proportion to the extent of these interactions. In a ‘poor’ solvent, the interactions are fewer and coil expansion or perturbation is restricted. The fundamental thermodynamic equation used to describe these systems relates the Gibbs free energy function G to the enthalpy H and entropy S, i.e. . A homogeneous solution is obtained when the Gibbs free energy of mixing , i.e. when the Gibbs free energy of the solution G 12 is lower than the Gibbs functions of the components of the mixture G 1 and G 2 . 8.2 Ideal mixtures of small molecules To understand the behaviour of polymers in solution more fully, a knowledge of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to ΔG M is essential, and it is instructive to consider first mixtures of small molecules, to establish some fundamental rules concerning ideal and non-ideal behaviour. Raoult's law is a useful starting point and defines an ideal solution as one in which the activity of each component in a mixture a i is equal to its mole fraction x i . This is valid only for components of comparable size, and where the intermolecular forces acting between both like and unlike molecules are equal. The latter requirement means that component molecules of each species can interchange positions without altering the total energy of the system, i.e.  and consequently it only remains for the entropy contribution ΔS M to be calculated. For a system in a given state, the entropy is related to the number of distinguishable arrangements the components in that state can adopt, and can be calculated from the  Boltzmann law , where W is the number of statistical microstates available to the system. We can begin by considering the mixing of N 1 molecules of component (1) with N 2 molecules of component (2) and this can be assumed to take place on a hypothetical lattice containing  cells of equal size. Although this formalism is not strictly necessary for the analysis, the arrangement of spherical molecules of equal size in the liquid state will, to the first near neighbour approximation, be similar to a regular lattice structure and so it is a useful structure to use as a framework for the mixing process. The total number of possible ways in which the component molecules can be arranged on the lattice increases when mixing takes place and is equal to , but as the interchanging of a molecule of (1) with another molecule (1), or (2) with (2) will be an indistinguishable process, the net number of distinguishable arrangements will be  The configurational (or combinatorial) entropy S c can then be derived from the Boltzmann law and  For large values of N i , Stirling's approximation can be used to deal with the factorials viz. In , and equation (8.3) becomes  which on dividing by N o gives  If , the mole fraction of component i, then  For the pure components,, and as ΔS M , the change in entropy on mixing, is given by  then we can write  so for a two component mixture  This expression is derived assuming (a) the volume change on mixing , (b) the molecules are all of equal size, (c) all possible arrangements have the same energy,, and (d) the motion of the components about their equilibrium positions remains unchanged on mixing . Thus the free energy of mixing, ΔG M is  which shows that mixing in ideal systems is an entropically driven, spontaneous process. 8.3 Non-ideal solutions Any deviations from assumptions (a) to (d) will constitute a deviation from ideality (an ideal solution is a rare occurrence) and several more realistic types of solution can be identified: (i) Athermal solutions; where  but ΔS M is not ideal (ii) Regular solutions; where ΔS M is ideal but , (iii) Irregular solutions; in which both ΔS M and ΔH M deviate from their ideal values. Polymer solutions tend to fall into category (iii) and the non-ideal behaviour can be attributed not only to the existence of a finite heat of mixing but also to the large difference in size between the polymer and solvent molecules. The polymer chain can be regarded as a series of small segments covalently bonded together and it is the effect of this chain connectivity which leads to deviations from an ideal entropy of mixing. The effect of connectivity can be assessed by calculating the entropy change associated with the different number of ways of arranging polymer chains and solvent molecules on a lattice and, as it will be demonstrated, this differs from that calculated for the ideal solution. This is embodied in the theory developed by Flory and Huggins, but still represents only the combinatorial contribution, whereas there are other (non-combinatorial) contributions to the entropy which come from the interaction of the polymer with the solvent and are much harder to quantify. Nevertheless, the Flory-Huggins theory forms the cornerstone of polymer solution thermodynamics and is worth considering further. 8.4 Flory-Huggins theory The dissolution of a polymer in a solvent can be regarded as a two stage process. The polymer exists initially in the solid state where it is restricted to only one of the many conformations which are available to it as a free isolated molecule. On passing into the liquid solution the chain achieves relative freedom and can now change rapidly among a multitude of possible equi-energetic conformations, dictated partly by the chain flexibility and partly by the interactions with the solvent. Flory and Huggins considered that formation of the solution depends on (a) the transfer of the polymer chain from a pure, perfectly ordered state to a state of disorder which has the necessary freedom to allow the chain to be placed randomly on a lattice, and (b) the mixing process of the flexible chains with solvent molecules . The formalism of the lattice was used, for convenience, to calculate the combinatorial entropy of mixing following the method outlined in section 8.2 for small molecules, including the same starting assumptions and restrictions. ENTROPY OF MIXING FOR ATHERMAL POLYMER SOLUTIONS Consider a polymer chain consisting of r covalently bonded segments whose size is the same as the solvent molecules, i.e.  where V 1 is the molar volume of component i. To calculate the number of ways this chain can be added to a lattice, the necessary restriction imposed is that the segments must occupy r contiguous sites on the lattice because of the connectivity. The problem is to examine the mixing of N 1 solvent molecules with N 2 monodisperse polymer molecules comprising r segments and we can begin by adding i polymer molecules to an empty lattice with a total number of cells N  Thus the number of vacant cells left which can accommodate the next  molecule will be  The  molecule can now be placed on the lattice, segment by segment, bearing in mind the restrictions imposed, viz. the connectivity of the segments, which requires the placing of each segment in a cell adjoining the preceding one. This in turn will depend on the availability of a suitable vacancy. The first segment can be placed in any empty cell but the second segment is restricted to the immediate near neighbours surrounding the first. This can be given by the co-ordination number of the lattice z but we must also know if a cell in the co-ordination shell is empty. If we let p i be the probability that an adjacent cell is vacant, then to a reasonable approximation this can be equated with the fraction of cells occupied by i polymer chains on the lattice i.e.  which is valid for large values of z. So the expected number of empty cells available for the second segment is zp i , and having removed one more vacant cell from the immediate   vicinity, the third and each succeeding segment will have  empty cells to choose from. The total number of ways in which the  molecule can be placed on the lattice is then   This gives the set of possible ways in which the  molecule can be accommodated on the lattice. The total number of ways for all N 2 molecules to be placed can then be obtained from the product of all possible ways, i.e.  The polymer molecules are all identical and so by analogy with equation (8.2) the total number of distinguishable ways of adding N 2 polymer molecules is  Substituting for W i gives  To evaluate the product term we can multiply and divide by r  This can be converted into the more convenient factorial form by remembering that the product  is equivalent to  and so equation (8.14) can be written as   The remaining empty cells on the lattice can now be filled by solvent molecules, but as there is only one distinguishable way in which this can be done,, there is no further contribution to W p and the entropy of the system. The latter can now be calculated from the Boltzmann equation. The factorials can again be approximated using Stirling's relation and while this requires considerable manipulation, which will be omitted here, it can eventually be shown that  To convert this into a form which will allow us to express this in the correct site fraction form we can add and subtract  on the r.h.s. of equation (8.19) to give  For the pure solvent  and the entropy . Similarly the entropy of the pure polymer S 2 can be obtained for , which gives  Equation 8.21 then represents the entropy associated with the disordered or amorphous polymer on the lattice in the absence of solvent. and so  It follows that the entropy change on mixing disordered polymer and solvent  and so  where φ i the volume fraction can replace the site fraction if it is considered that the number of sites occupied by the polymer and solvent is proportional to their respective volumes. Equation (8.22) is the expression for the combinatorial entropy of mixing of an athermal polymer solution and comparison with equation (8.7) shows that they are similar in form except for the fact that now the volume fraction is found to be the most convenient way of expressing the entropy change, rather than the mole fraction used for small molecules. This change arises from the differences in size between the components which would normally mean mole fractions close to unity for the solvent especially when dilute solutions are being studied. We can gain a further understanding of how the size of the polymer chain affects the magnitude of ΔS M and why it differs from  (equation 8.7), by recasting equation (8.22) in the following way. The volume fraction φ i can be expressed in terms of the number of moles n i , and the volume V i of component i, as   where V is the total volume and . If n i is converted to molar quantities then  As V i can conveniently be expressed as a function of a reference volume V o such that and assuming that, without introducing significant error, r can be equated with the degree of polymerization for the polymer then  If the volume fraction form is retained, then for a simple liquid mixture , but for a polymer solution  and the last term in equation (8.24) will be smaller than the equivalent term calculated for small molecules. Consequently ΔS M per mole of lattice sites (or equivalent volume) will be very much less than  and the contribution of the combinatorial entropy to the mixing process in a polymer solution is not as large as that for solutions of small molecules when calculated in terms of volume fractions and expressed as per mole of sites. 8.5 Enthalpy change on mixing The derivation of ΔS M from the lattice theory has been made on the assumption that no heat or energy change occurs on mixing. This is an uncommon situation as experimental experience suggests that the energy change is finite. We can make use of regular solution theory to obtain an expression for ΔH M where this change in energy is assumed to arise from the formation of new solvent-polymer (1–2) contacts on mixing which replace some of the (1–1) and (2–2) contacts present in the pure solvent, and the pure polymer components respectively. This can be represented by a quasi-chemical process  where the formation of a solvent-polymer contact requires first the breaking of (1–1) and (2–2) contacts, and can be expressed as an interchange energy AΔΕ 12 per contact, given by  Here Ε ii and Ε ij are the contact energies for each species. The energy of mixing ΔU M can be replaced by ΔH M if no volume change takes place on mixing, and for q new contacts formed in solution  The number of contacts can be estimated from the lattice model by assuming that the probability of having a lattice cell occupied by a solvent molecule is simply the volume fraction φ 1 . This means that each polymer molecule will be surrounded by   solvent molecules, and for N 2 polymer molecules  From the definition of φ 2 we obtain , hence  which is the van Laar expression derived for regular solutions and shows that this approach can be applied to polymer systems. To eliminate z, a dimensionless parameter  per solvent molecule, is defined as  which is the difference in energy between a solvent molecule when it is immersed in pure polymer and when in pure solvent. It can also be expressed in the alternative form , where B is now an interaction density. The final expression is  and the interaction parameter χ 1 is an important feature of polymer solution theory which will be met with frequently. 8.6 Free energy of mixing Having calculated the entropy and enthalpy contributions to mixing, these can now be combined to give the expression for the free energy of mixing, as  It is more useful to express equation (8.32) in terms of the chemical potentials of the pure solvent  and the solvent in solution , by differentiating the expression with respect to the number of solvent molecules N 1 to obtain the partial molar Gibbs free energy of dilution (after multiplying by Avogadro's number), This could also be carried out for the polymer , but as it makes no difference which one is taken (both having started from ΔG M ), equation (8.33) is more convenient to use. While this expression is not strictly valid for the dilute solution regime it can be converted into a structure which is extremely informative about deviations from ideal solution behaviour encountered when measuring the molar mass by techniques such as osmotic pressure. If the logarithmic term is expanded using a Taylor series: but truncated after the squared term, assuming φ 2 is small, then, This can be modified by remembering that  and , where v 2 is the partial specific volume of the polymer. This can be related to the polymer molecular weight M 2 through  so that and finally  Let us now anticipate the molar mass measurements to be described in chapter 9 and examine the osmotic pressure of a polymer solution in the light of equation (8.35). 8.7 Osmotic pressure The osmotic pressure π of a solution can be regarded as the pressure which must be exerted on that solution to raise the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution  back up to that of the pure solvent  at a standard pressure P, i.e.  The compressibility of the solvent  is equal to the molar volume of the solvent in solution, V 1 , and can be assumed to be unchanged over a small range of pressures, thus   giving  Substitution in (8.35) gives  or  This is a limited virial expansion in which the first term is the classical van't Hoff expression for the osmotic pressure at infinite dilution. The second term is related to the deviation from ideal behaviour and gives a relationship between the second virial  coefficient B and the interaction parameter χ 1  Thus when  then  and the osmotic pressure is given by the ideal solution law. 8.8 Limitations of the Flory-Huggins theory The simple lattice theory does not describe the behaviour of dilute polymer solutions particularly well because the following simplifications in the theoretical treatment are invalid: (1) it was assumed that the segment-locating process is purely statistical, but this would only be true if ΔΕ 12 was zero; (2) the treatment assumed that the flexibility of the chain is unaltered on passing into the solution from the solid state — this limits the calculation of ΔS M to the combinatorial contribution only and neglects any contribution from continual flexing of the chain in solution which will contribute to the non-combinatorial or excess entropy of mixing; (3) any possible specific solvent-polymer interactions which might lead to orientation of the solvent molecules in the vicinity of the polymer chain are neglected i.e. polar solutions may be inadequately catered for by this theory; (4) a uniform density of lattice site occupation is assumed, but this will only apply to relatively concentrated solutions; (5) the parameter χ 1 is often concentration-dependent but this is ignored . It is now accepted that a non-combinatorial entropy contribution arises from the formation of new (1–2) contacts in the mixture which change the vibrational frequencies of the two components, i.e. assumption (d) in section 8.2 must be relaxed. This can be allowed for by recognizing that χ 1 is actually a free energy parameter comprising entropic χ H and enthalpic χ S contributions, such that. These are defined by  Experiments tend to show that the major contribution comes from the χ s component, indicating that there is a large decrease in entropy (non-combinatorial) which is acting against the dissolution process of a polymer in a solvent. In spite of much justifiable criticism, the Flory-Huggins theory can still generate considerable interest because of the limited amount of success which can be claimed for it in relation to phase equilibria studies. 8.9 Phase equilibria Use can be made of the Flory-Huggins theory to predict the equilibrium behaviour of two liquid phases when both contain amorphous polymer and one or even two solvents. Consider a two component system consisting of a liquid (1) which is a poor solvent for a polymer (2). Complete miscibility occurs when the Gibbs free energy of mixing is less than the Gibbs free energies of the components, and the solution maintains its homogeneity only as long as ΔG M remains less than the Gibbs free energy of any two possible co-existing phases. The situation is represented by curve T 5 in figure 8.2. The miscibility of this type of system is observed to be strongly temperature dependent and as T decreases the solution separates into two phases. Thus at any temperature, say T 1 ,; the Gibbs free energy of any mixture, composition  in the composition range  to , is higher than either of the two co-existing phases whose compositions are  and  and phase separation takes place. The compositions of the two phases  and  do not  correspond to the two minima, but are measured from the points of contact of the double tangent AB with the Gibbs free energy curve. The same is true for other temperatures lying below T c , and the inflexion points can be joined to bound an area representing the heterogeneous two phase system, where there is limited solubility of component 2 in 1 and vice-versa. This is called a cloud-point curve. As the temperature is increased the limits of this two phase co-existence contract, until eventually they coalesce to produce a homogeneous, one phase, mixture at T c , the critical solution temperature. This is sometimes referred to as the critical consolute point. In general, we can say that if the free energy-composition curve has a shape which allows a tangent to touch it at two points, phase separation will occur. The critical solution temperature is an important quantity and can be accurately defined in terms of the chemical potential. It represents the point at which the inflexion points on the curve merge, and so it is the temperature where the first, second, and third derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to mole fraction are zero. It is also true that the partial molar Gibbs free energies of each component are equal at this point and it emerges that the conditions for incipient phase separation are  By remembering that , application of these criteria for equilibrium to equation (8.33) leads to the first derivative of that equation  while the second derivative is  where the subscript c denotes critical conditions. The critical composition at which phase separation is first detected is then  and  which indicates that  at infinitely large chain length. The interaction parameter χ 1 is a useful measure of the solvent power. Poor solvents have values of χ 1 close to 0.5 while an improvement in solvent power lowers χ 1 . Generally, a variation from 0.5 to -1.0 can be observed although for many synthetic polymer solutions the range is 0.6 to 0.3. A linear temperature dependence for χ 1 is also predicted of the general form , which suggests that as the temperature increases the solvating power of the liquid should increase. This has implications for polymer fractionation. 8.10 Fractionation The relations derived in this and other chapters normally assume that the polymer sample has a unique molar mass. This situation is rarely achieved in practice and it is useful to know the form of the molar mass distribution in a sample, as this can have a significant bearing on the physical properties. It is also advantageous to be able to prepare sample fractions, whose homogeneity is considerably better than the parent polymer, especially when testing dilute solution theory. We have seen that the chain length can be related to the solvent power, expressed as χ 1 , by equation (8.46) and this is illustrated in figure 8.3. The implication is that if χ 1 can be carefully controlled, conditions could be attained which would allow a given molecular species to precipitate, while leaving larger or smaller molecules in solution. This process is known as fractionation. Experimentally, a polymer sample can be fractionated in a variety of ways and three in common use are: (1) addition of a non-solvent to a polymer solution; (2) lowering the temperature of the solution; and (3) column chromatography . In the first method the control of χ 1 is effected by adding a non-solvent to the polymer solution. If the addition is slow, χ 1 increases gradually until the critical value for large molecules is reached. This causes precipitation of the longest chains first and these can be separated from the shorter chains which remain in solution. In practice the polymer solution is held at a constant temperature while precipitant is added to the stirred solution. When the solution becomes turbid the mixture is warmed until the precipitate dissolves. The solution is then returned to the original temperature and the   precipitate which reforms is allowed to settle and then separated. This ensures that the precipitated fraction is not broadened by local precipitation during addition of the non-solvent. Successive additions of small quantities of non-solvent to the solution allow a series of fractions of steadily decreasing molar mass to be separated. In the second method, χ 1 is varied by altering the temperature, with similar results. For both techniques, it is useful to dissolve the polymer initially in a poor solvent with a large χ 1 value. This ensures that only small quantities of non-solvent are required to precipitate the polymer in method 1, and that the temperature changes required in method 2 are small. In column chromatography the polymer is precipitated on the inert support medium at the top of a column which has a temperature gradient imposed along its length. The packing is usually glass beads of 0.1 to 0.3 mm diameter. A solvent + non-solvent mixture is used to elute the sample and fractionation is achieved by using a solvent gradient. This is generated in a mixing system, situated above the column, by constantly increasing the solvent to non-solvent ratio and as the mixture is initially a poor solvent which is gradually enriched by the good solvent the low molar mass fractions are eluted first. Fractions of increasing molar mass are collected from the bottom of the column. In each of the techniques, the mass and molar mass of the fractions are recorded and a distribution curve for the sample can be constructed from the results. However, as the fractions themselves have a molar mass distribution, extensive overlapping of the fractions will occur as shown schematically in figure 8.4. Consequently a simple histogram constructed from the mass and molar mass of each fraction will not provide a good representation of the distribution and a method must be used to compensate for the overlapping. A useful approach was proposed by Schulz who suggested that a cumulative mass fraction be plotted against the molar mass. The cumulative mass fraction  can be calculated by adding half the mass fraction W i of the i th fraction to the total mass fraction    of those fractions preceding it, i.e.  The values of  are plotted against the corresponding M i and connected by a smooth curve as shown in figure 8.5, to give the integral distribution curve. The differential curve can be obtained by determining the slope of this curve at selected molar masses and plotting this against the appropriate molar mass. 8.11 Flory-Krigbaum theory To overcome the limitations of the lattice theory resulting from the discontinuous nature of a dilute polymer solution, Flory and Krigbaum discarded the idea of a uniform distribution of chain segments in the liquid. Instead they considered the solution to be composed of areas containing polymer which were separated by the solvent. In these areas the polymer segments were assumed to possess a Gaussian distribution about the centre of mass, but even with this distribution the chain segments still occupy a finite volume from which all other chain segments are excluded. It is within this excluded volume that the long range interactions originate which are discussed more fully in chapter 10. Flory and Krigbaum defined an enthalpy  parameter and an entropy of dilution  parameter such that the thermodynamic functions used to describe these long  range effects are given in terms of the excess partial molar quantities   From equation (8.33) it can be seen that the excess free energy of dilution is  Combination of these non-ideal terms then yields  As we saw from equation (8.40), when  and  the solution appears to behave as though it were ideal. The point at which this occurs is known as the FLORY or THETA point and is in some ways analogous to the Boyle point for a non-ideal gas. Under these conditions  The temperature at which these conditions are obtained is the FLORY or THETA temperature Θ, conveniently defined as . This tells us that Θ will only have a meaningful value when ψ 1 and κ 1 have the same sign. Substitution in (8.50) followed by rearrangement gives  and shows that deviations from ideal behaviour vanish when . The theta temperature is a well defined state of the polymer solution at which the excluded volume effects are eliminated and the polymer coil is in an unperturbed condition (see chapter 10). Above the theta temperature expansion of the coil takes place, caused by interactions with the solvent, whereas below * the polymer segments attract one another, the excluded volume is negative, the coils tend to collapse and eventual phase separation occurs. 8.12 Location of the theta temperature The theta temperature of a polymer-solvent system can be measured from phase separation studies. The value of χ 1 . c; at the critical concentration is related to the chain length of the polymer by equation (8.46), and substitution in (8.52) leads to  where now we have replaced r with the equivalent degree of polymerization χ n . Rearrangement gives    Remembering that , where M and  are the molar mass and partial specific volume of the polymer, and V 1 is the molar volume of the solvent, the equation states that the critical temperature is a function of M and the value of T c at infinite M is the theta temperature for the system. Precipitation data for several systems have proved the validity of equation (8.54). Linear plots are obtained with a positive slope from which the entropy parameter ψ 1 can be calculated as shown in figure 8.6. Typical values are shown in table 8.1, but ψ 1 values measured for systems such as polystyrene + cyclohexane have been found to be almost ten times larger than those derived from other methods of measurement. This appears to arise from the assumption in the Flory-Huggins theory that χ 1 is concentration independent and improved values of ψ 1 are obtained when this is rectified. The theta temperature, calculated from equation (8.54) for each system is in good agreement with that measured from the temperature variation of A 2 (=B/RT see chapter 9). Curves of A 2 , measured at various temperatures in the vicinity of Θ, are constructed as a function of temperature for one or more molar masses as shown in figure 8.7. Intersection of the curves with the T-axis occurs when  and . The curves for each molar mass of the same polymer should all intersect at . 8.13 Lower critical solution temperatures So far we have been concerned with non-polar solutions of amorphous polymers, whose solubility is increased with rising temperature, because the additional thermal motion helps to decrease attractive forces between like molecules, and encourages energetically less favourable contacts. The phase diagram for such systems, when the solvent is poor, is depicted by area A in figure 8.8, where the critical temperature T c occurs near the maximum of the cloud-point curve and is often referred to as the upper   critical solution temperature (UCST). This behaviour follows from that depicted in figure 8.2. For non-polar systems ΔS M is normally positive but weighted heavily by T and so solubility depends mainly on the magnitude of ΔH M , which is normally endothermic (positive). Consequently as T decreases ΔG M eventually becomes positive and phase separation takes place. Values of Θ and ψ 1 , in table 8.1, show that for systems 1 to 4 the entropy parameter is positive, as expected, but for poly (acrylic acid) in dioxan and polymethacrylonitrile in butanone, ψ is negative at the theta temperature. As , when , the enthalpy is also negative for these systems. This means that systems 5 and 6 exhibit an unusual decrease in solubility as the temperature rises, and the cloud-point curve is now inverted as in area B. The corresponding critical temperature is located at the minimum of the miscibility curve and is known as the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). In systems 5 and 6 this phenomenon is a result of hydrogen-bond formation between the polymer and solvent, which enhances the solubility. As hydrogen bonds are thermally labile a rise in T reduces the number of bonds and causes eventual phase separation. In solutions, which are stabilized in this way by secondary bonding, the LCST usually appears below the boiling temperature of the solvent but it has been found experimentally that an LCST can be detected in non-polar systems when these are examined at temperatures approaching the critical temperature of the solvent. Polyisobutylene in a series of n-alkanes, polystyrene in methyl acetate and cyclohexane, and cellulose acetate in acetone all exhibit LCSTs. The LCST is located by heating the solutions, in sealed tubes, up to temperatures approaching the gas-liquid critical point of the solvent. As the temperature rises, the liquid expands much more rapidly than the polymer, which is restrained by the  covalent bonding between its segments. At high temperatures, the spaces between the solvent molecules have to be reduced if mixing is to take place and when this eventually results in too great a loss of entropy, phase separation occurs. The separation of polymer/solvent systems into two phases as the temperature increases is now recognized to be a characteristic feature of all polymer solutions. This presents a problem of interpretation within the framework of regular solution theory, as the accepted form of χ 1 predicts a monotonic change with temperature and is incapable of dealing with two critical consolute points. The problem of how to accommodate, in a theoretical framework, the existence of two miscibility gaps requires a new approach, and a more elaborate treatment by Prigogine and co-workers encompasses the difference in size between the components of a mixture, which cannot be ignored for polymer solutions. They replaced the rigid lattice model used by Flory and Huggins, which is valid only at absolute zero, with a flexible lattice whose cells change volume, with temperature and pressure. This allowed them to include in their theory dissimilarities in free volume between polymer and solvent, together with the corresponding interactions. The same approach was extended by both Patterson and Flory to deal specifically with polymer systems. The most important of the new parameters is the so-called ‘structural effect’ which is related to the number of degrees of freedom ‘3 c ’which a molecule possesses, divided by the number of external contacts q. This structural factor  is a measure of the number of external degrees of freedom per segment and changes with the length of the component. Thus the ratio decreases as a liquid becomes increasingly polymeric. The expansion and free volume can then be characterized by the ratio of the thermal energy arising from the external degrees of freedom available to the component, U thermal , and the interaction energy between neighbouring non-bonded segments, U cohesive which will oppose the thermal energy effects, i.e.  where Ε * is the characteristic cohesive energy per contact. For convenience q may be replaced by r, the number of chain segments, although q will actually be less than r because some of the external contacts are used in forming the covalent bonds in the chain. Free volume dissimilarities become increasingly important as the size of one component increases with respect to the second, as in polymer solutions, and when these differences are sufficiently large, phase separation can be observed at the LCST. The differences in expansivity can be accounted for if the interaction parameter is now expressed as  where the first term reflects the interchange energy on forming contacts of unlike type and includes segment size differences, while the second term is the new ‘structural’ contribution coming from free volume changes on mixing a dense polymer with an expanded solvent. This can be represented schematically in figure 8.9. The first term in (8.56), shown by curve 1, is merely an expression of the Flory-Huggins theory where X decreases constantly with rising temperature, but now   inclusion of the new free volume term, shown by curve 2, modifies the behaviour of χ. The second term gains in importance as the expansivities of the two components become increasingly divergent with temperature and the net effect is to increase χ again until it once more attains its critical value at high temperature. The LCST which results, is then a consequence of these free volume differences and is an entropically controlled phenomenon. This can be illustrated in the following ways. In terms of the flexible lattice model, one can imagine the polymer and liquid lattices expanding at different rates until a temperature is reached at which the highly expanded liquid lattice can no longer be distorted sufficiently to accommodate the less expanded polymer lattice and form a solution, i.e. the loss in entropy during the distortion becomes so large and unfavourable that phase separation (LCST) takes place. Alternatively, a polymer solution can be thought of as a system formed by the condensation of solvent into a polymer. As the temperature increases, the entropy loss incurred during condensation becomes greater until eventually it is so unfavourable that condensation in the polymer is impossible, and phase separation takes place. Neither picture is particularly rigorous but they serve to emphasize the fact that the LCST is an entropically controlled phenomenon. 8.14 Solubility and the cohesive energy density Solvent-polymer compatibility problems are repeatedly encountered in industry. For example, in situations requiring the selection of elastomers for use as hose-pipes or gaskets, the correct choice of elastomer is of prime importance, as contact with highly compatible fluids may cause serious swelling and impair the operation of the system. The wrong selection can have far reaching consequences; the initial choice of an elastomer for the seals in the landing gear of the DC-8 aircraft resulted in serious jamming because the seals become swollen when in contact with the hydraulic fluid. This almost led to grounding of the plane but replacement with an incompatible elastomer made from ethylene-propylene copolymer rectified the fault. To avoid such problems a technologist may wish to have at his disposal a rough guide to aid the selection of solvents for a polymer or to assess the extent of polymer-liquid interaction other than those already described. Here use can be made of a semi-empirical approach suggested by Hildebrand and based on the premise that ‘like dissolves like’. The treatment involves relating the enthalpy of mixing to the cohesive energy density  and defines a solubility parameter , where E is the molar energy of vaporization and V is the molar volume of the component. The    proposed relation for the heat of mixing of two non-polar components  shows that ΔH M is small for mixtures with similar solubility parameters and this indicates compatibility. Values of the solubility parameter for simple liquids can be readily calculated from the enthalpy of vaporization. The same method cannot be used for a polymer and one must resort to comparative techniques. Usually δ for a polymer is established by finding the solvent which will produce maximum swelling of a network or the largest value of the limiting viscosity number, as both indicate maximum compatibility. The polymer is then assigned a similar value of δ. Alternatively, Small and Hoy have tabulated a series of group molar attraction constants from which a good estimate of δ for most polymers can be made. The suggested group contributions are shown in table 8.3 and the solubility parameter for a polymer can be estimated from the sum of the various molar attraction constants F for the groups which make up the repeat unit i.e.   Here V is the molar volume of the repeat unit whose molar mass is M o and p is the polymer density. Thus for poly (methyl methacrylate) with  and , we have using the Hoy values  Therefore  For a more complex polyhydroxyether of Bisphenol A structure and with   Both estimates are within 10 per cent of experimentally determined values. Attempts to correlate δ with χ 1 from the Flory-Huggins equation have met with limited success because of the unjustifiable assumptions made in the derivation. It is now believed, however, that χ 1 is not an enthalpy parameter but a free energy parameter and a relation of the form c.f. section 8.8  has improved the correlation. Here  is supposed to compensate for the lack of a non-combinatorial entropy contribution in the Flory-Huggins treatment. Unfortunately, solubility is not a simple process and secondary bonding may play an important role in determining component interactions. More detailed approaches have been suggested, which introduce a three-dimensional δ composed of contributions from van der Waals dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The overall solubility parameter is then the sum of the various contributions  Usually two dimensional plots are constructed first, before the three dimensional ‘solubility volume’ is established, as shown in figure 8.10. This is not a convenient construction and often a plot of  versus δ H is considered to be sufficiently accurate as δ n and δ p are usually similar and the main polar contribution comes from the hydrogen bonding factor δ H . 8.15 Polymer-polymer mixtures In the constant search for new materials with improved performance, the idea of mixing two or more different polymers to form new substances having a combination of all the attributes of the components, is deceptively attractive. Deceptively, because in practice  it is rarely accomplished and only in a few cases have polymer blends or mixtures achieved industrial importance. The main reason is that most common polymers do not mix with one another to form homogeneous, one phase solutions or blends, and an explanation for this is to be found in the thermodynamics of solutions which have been outlined in the previous sections. As we have seen, when two liquids, or a liquid and a polymer are mixed, the formation of a homogeneous, one phase solution is assisted mainly by the large favourable gain in combinatorial entropy. This entropic contribution is progressively reduced when one or both components increase in size, and the reason for this becomes obvious on inspection of equation (8.24). When r 1 and r 2 both increase, then ΔS M becomes smaller; consequently attempts to mix two high molar mass polymer samples will receive little assistance from this function and must depend increasingly on a favourable (negative) heat of mixing embodied in the χ parameter. This loss of entropy can be conveniently illustrated using the simple lattice model shown in figure 8.11. Here a 10 x 10 lattice, containing 50 white and 50 black units randomly mixed (a), will result in approximately 10 30 possible different arrangements of the units on mixing. If these white units are now connected to other white units, and black to black (b), to form five equal chains of each colour with , then the number of possible arrangements of these chains decreases to about 10 3 . Thus as r 1 and r 2 approach infinity ΔS M will become negligible and the free energy of mixing will become essentially dependent on ΔH M which now has to be either very small or negative. The heat of mixing for the majority of polymer (1)— polymer (2) pairs tends to be endothermic and can be approximated by reference to the solubility parameters using equation (8.57). This can be written as    where the reference volume normally assumes a value of . The critical value for χ 12 can be estimated from  where x i is the degree of polymerization, related to the actual degree of polymerization x n and the reference volume by  with V R the molar volume of the repeat unit. The critical values for χ 12 above which the two polymers will phase separate, calculated for various mixtures with , are shown in table 8.4 along with the corresponding differences in δ. This shows that for mixing to take place between high molecular weight components the solubility parameters would have to be virtually identical. This limits the number of possible combinations such that only a few examples exist in this category. These include polystyrene/ poly (α-methyl styrene) below M  70 000, and the polyacrylates mixed with the corresponding poly vinyl esters, e.g.  and  The situation changes if ΔH M is negative as this will encourage mixing, and the search for binary polymer blends which are miscible has focussed on combinations in which specific intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, ion-dipole interactions, or charge transfer complex formation, can exist between the component polymers. A substantial number of miscible blends have now been discovered using this principle and it is possible to identify certain groups or repeat units, which when incorporated in polymer chains tend to enter into these intermolecular interactions and enhance the miscibility. A short selection of some of these complementary groups is given in table 8.5, where    a polymer containing groups or composed of units from column 1 will tend to form miscible blends with polymers containing groups or composed of units from column 2. Thus it is believed that polystyrene forms miscible blends with poly (vinyl methylether), and with poly (phenylene oxide) s (examples 1 and 2, respectively) because of interactions between the π-electrons of the phenyl rings and the lone pairs of the ether oxygens. Similarly it has been suggested that a weak hydrogen bond, which is strong enough to induce miscibility can form between the carbonyl unit of poly (methyl methacrylate) and the α-hydrogen of poly (vinyl chloride)(example 3 where ). i.e.   Much stronger hydrogen bonding interactions can be obtained if units such as or sites for ion-dipole interactions such as can be built into chains, and even in relatively small amounts these can transform immiscible pairs into totally miscible blends. Many of these blends undergo quite rapid demixing as the temperature is raised and an LCST phase boundary can be located above the glass transition temperature of the blend. The origins of the lower critical phase separation phenomenon in polymer blends are not yet clearly understood and three possible causes have been proposed. (i) Free volume dissimilarities may become unfavourable to mixing on increasing the temperature. (ii) There may be unfavourable entropy contributions arising from non-random mixing. (iii) A temperature dependent heat of mixing may result if specific intermolecular interactions, which dissociate on heating, are responsible for miscibility at lower temperatures. While the latter seems the most likely cause in many blends where specific interactions have been identified, miscible blends can also be obtained when certain statistical copolymers are mixed with either a homopolymer, or another copolymer, in which no such interactions have been located. Thus poly (styrene-stat-acrylonitrile) will form miscible blends with poly (methyl methacrylate) if the composition of the copolymer lies in the range 10–39 wt% acrylonitrile. This range of compositions is called the ‘miscibility window’ and has been reported to be present in other systems. The drive  towards formation of a miscible solid solution in these cases is believed to arise when large repulsive interactions exist between the monomer units (A) and (B) comprising the copolymer; on mixing with a polymer (C), the number of these unfavourable (A B) contacts are reduced by forming less repulsive (A-C) or (B-C) contacts and a miscible blend results. Many of these blends also exhibit an LCST. Thus the driving force towards lower critical phase separation in polymer-polymer solutions may depend on the system or may be a combination of the effects (i)—(iii)."
ACA ACA-HXH-002 0.23 "Gathering your materials together As we suggested at the end of Chapter 1, when you write you use — inevitably — what other people have written. For example, in writing an essay on some aspect of Emily Dickinson's poetry, you might use, possibly in order of likelihood: (a) some poems by Emily Dickinson, which you analyse;(b) a bibliography (list of books and articles), to find out what has been written by and on this poet;(c) one or more critical articles on Emily Dickinson;(d) a biography of the writer;(e) a dictionary of symbolism, to look up some of the symbols she uses;(f) a concordance to the works of Emily Dickinson (this is a list of all the words she used, and where she used them). Each of these sources provides new information that will enrich the ideas you start out with; and the materials you explore will also provide a springboard into completely new ideas, that you are unlikely to have simply by contemplating the poems themselves. This chapter describes some of the sources you might need to look at as you go about your study, how to find them, and how to use them. 2.1 HOW TO CHOOSE A LITERARY TEXT TO WORK ON We can begin by returning to the question of defining your essay topic. You choose an author; but then you need to decide which text or texts to  work on (sometimes which parts of that text or texts), and which version of the texts to choose. If you want to talk about the work of an author, you need to judge how many texts to talk about and how varied your selection needs to be (many authors write in different modes: novels, short stories, poems, diaries and letters, etc). Other choices include: should you pick well-known texts or little-known texts? Should you choose texts which are central to established literary traditions (canonised texts) or texts by marginalised writers? The important element here is the sense of choice and decision: the materials you choose actively shape the essay you produce. They are not simply background materials for your preparation, but guide what sort of essay will result. In some cases choice is governed by teachers or by the exam paper. In other cases it is shaped by personal preference (e.g. you already feel that you have something specific to say on a particular work). In other cases again, your selection is based on an informal research procedure: you choose works you consider representative in some respect (e.g. genre, length, typicality of theme); or well-known works (which you think need fresh attention); or little-known or neglected, ""minor"" works (which need discovery or rehabilitation). At this stage the most important consideration is that your choice is consistent with the overall purpose of the essay topic you are proposing. Once you have chosen your texts (or had them chosen for you), you need to decide how to focus on them. No matter how familiar with literary works you become, you cannot focus equally on all parts of a text (particularly a long text, such as a novel): so you need to decide which parts of it are most worth reading closely and writing about. This varies from novel to novel; but as a general guideline it is usually worth paying particular attention to the beginning and ending (where structural aspects of the novel are often signalled most clearly). With a poem, it is worth spending time thinking about why it has the title it has. Beginnings, endings and titles are sections of texts which usually repay particular study. Do you need to worry about which version of a text to use? One context in which it makes a difference is when you refer to a text by page or line number; different versions are often different in this respect, so the least you should do is tell your reader which edition you are referring to (which publisher, editor, etc.). You might also try to use an edition which your reader can independently get hold of, so that she or he can check what you say. The other reason for worrying about which version you should use relates to AUTHENTICITY. Some versions of a text convey better than others what the author originally wrote. Even the first printed edition of a text may have been altered by an editor, printer or typesetter. For example, in its first printed version Shakespeare's Henry V has a line  ""and a table of green fields"" , which modern editors now think should probably have been ""and he babbled of green fields"" . Bowdler's 1818 edition of Shakespeare cut out parts ""unsuitable for ladies"" . Amos Tutuola's (Nigerian) novel The Palm Wine Drinkard had its idiosyncratic English modified by its British publisher, Faber and Faber. Modern critical editions sometimes also make changes which go against authorial intentions; Keynes's Oxford edition of Blake's poems, for example, changes Blake's invented punctuation system to make it fit with standard rules of punctuation. Each of these versions has its own authenticity; and editorial decisions are interesting in their own right (and merit investigation) for what they tell us about the times when they were made (for example, the Tutuola revisions tell us about British attitudes during the 1960s to the English of non-native speakers). Usually, however, you will be concerned with getting as close as possible to what the author of the text (not a later editor or printer) wanted it to be. This means that you should be aware of different possible editions of the text. It is useful to distinguish between an original edition, a popular reprint, and a critical edition. The original edition is the text as it was first printed; most contemporary novels for example exist only in original editions. Older texts, however, may exist also in critical editions. A CRITICAL EDITION has a named editor, who tries to make the text the best possible version, and will usually include footnotes or appendices explaining decisions taken about words in the text. Critical editions are often more reliable versions of the text than original editions, since they will correct accidental errors or random editorial decisions in the original editions. Older texts are also reprinted in POPULAR EDITIONS (popular = for ordinary people, generally for non-academic purposes, though in practice often the editions used on courses). A popular edition is a version of a text intended for the general rather than the academic reader. You can tell whether a text you have is a critical or a popular edition by looking at the following features:— Does it have a note on the text, explaining spelling conventions used, etc.?— Does it have an introduction by an editor?— Does it have footnotes or endnotes?— Is it a numbered part of a multi-volume edition? If the answer to these questions is ""yes"" , you have a critical edition. Sometimes a popular edition will be based on a critical edition, making it appropriate for most uses. But you should avoid illustrated ""coffee table"" versions or simplified rewritten editions of a text intended for EFL students or children. You are unlikely always to have access to an authoritative edition. The next best thing is to show that you are aware of the issues that surround a choice of text (some of these will probably be explained in the introductory ""Note on the Text"" ). If you read with such issues in mind — and how they actively affect what sense you can make of a text — introductory notes often become relevant and interesting in unexpected ways. 2.2 HOW TO CHOOSE CRITICAL ANALYSES TO WORK WITH Much of what you will need for your study will be in the literary texts you have chosen — especially if you are reading annotated critical editions. But you will probably also want to consult critical analyses of those works, for a range of possible reasons. Perhaps the major problem in choosing critical texts to read and refer to is whether or not to use specialised student textbooks. There is a distinction in principle between a book which sets out original ideas, and justifies them (a MONOGRAPH), and a book whose primary function is to distil and tell you what other people's ideas are (a TEXTBOOK). Textbooks may of course also include original ideas, so the distinction becomes blurred (especially where a textbook doesn't tell you where it is offering contentious interpretations). But developing entirely new arguments is not usually a textbook's main function. A formulation of an original idea (e.g. in a monograph) is a PRIMARY SOURCE of that idea; its repetition or paraphrase in a textbook (or in another monograph) is a SECONDARY SOURCE of it. One advantage of secondary sources is that they are often easy to understand; but a problem which can arise is that they may have altered or distorted the original idea. For this reason, it is better to refer at some stage to the primary source of an idea, even if you came across it first in a secondary source. Textbooks are useful (particularly for telling you which primary sources to look for), but you should not have to refer to them very often in writing your final essay or dissertation. Quoting extensively from a textbook in a PhD thesis, for example(especially if you treat it as an authority rather than as something for critical comment) is likely to give the wrong impression: that you are a beginner rather than an expert in your subject. Think about what you are looking for when you consult a textbook. Are you seeking:(a) background factual information?(b) other people's interpretations of what you are reading?(c) accepted areas for debate (to narrow down what you think you should say, because of what other people have chosen to talk about)? Your use of information sources needs to be guided by a sense of purpose in your search, as well as by the interest and pleasure of browsing. In the next section we consider some sources of information, as we explore why and how sources can be useful in your work. Our purpose is not to define a basic library for you, but rather to suggest kinds of books which you might look for; and our choice of texts is based primarily on their convenience as illustrations. 2.3 BOOKS WHICH LIST FACTS (DICTIONARIES, ETC.), AND HOW TO USE THEM IN YOUR RESEARCH In most literary essays your central concern will be to say something about a text; and most of what you need will be there, in the text itself. Since the text provides you with so much material, it may not be obvious why dictionaries, encyclopedias and other books in the reference section of your library can be useful to you. In this section we explain why they can, and list some of the information sources you might want to use. In all cases, remember that the information you find is interesting or valuable only to the extent that you can put it to relevant use in your essay; facts do not come with fixed, off-the-peg significance. The most obvious example of an information source is a dictionary, which tells you what words mean. Remember that what you think a word means is not necessarily what it meant for the writer. It may have had a different meaning in a different place (e.g. ""cot"" means a child's bed in British English, but also a bed for adults in Indian English), or at a different time (e.g. ""gentle"" used to carry the meaning of ""upper class"" , as in ""gentry"" , but which now can be used as an approving description — something like ""sensitive"" — of anyone's character). Because words change in meaning, it can be particularly useful to use a historical dictionary such as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED existing as a multi-volume set, or photographically reduced, or on CD-rom). The full version of this dictionary lists all the meanings a word has had, with quotations to illustrate them. Other dictionaries contain lists of words which have special meanings in literary criticism, such as The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics or A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms. If you are writing about a twentieth-century author and you want ideas about the author or what to say about her or him, you can use the massive reference work published by Gale, Contemporary Authors (which lists biographical and bibliographical information, together with other relevant comments) and Contemporary Literary Criticism, which is described as ""excerpts from criticism of the works of today's novelists, poets, playwrights and other creative writers"" . Some authors will be less well-documented in traditional information sources such as these, for example pre-twentieth-century women authors; and here you may find it useful to use the Dictionary of British Women Writers. On the other hand, better known authors may have specialised sources of information associated with them, such as A D.H. Lawrence Handbook. And some authors have concordances devoted to them. A CONCORDANCE, as we have said, is a list of all the words used by a particular author, with an indication of where those words are used. You can use it to find a particular place in a text if you know a word used there, or as a way of following up a particular theme, metaphor or symbol. For example, if you look up the word ""wit"" in a Concordance to Congreve, you will find all the places where the seventeenth-century dramatist Congreve used that word; you can then work out what its particular meaning for Congreve must have been by studying how he uses it. Sometimes you have access to a text, but not to all the information you would like about it. You may have seen a film, but wish to talk about who did the cinematography or who played a particular character. Once the film credits are over, you have no permanent record. In this case you might use a popular reference work like Halliwell's Film Guide, or a journal like The Monthly Film Bulletin or Sight and Sound. There are also more specialised information sources you might need to use: if you want to know about the readership of a particular contemporary magazine or newspaper, for example(perhaps as part of a study of the relation between ideology and audience) you could use BRAD ( ""British Rate and Data"" ), which lists advertising rates and audited newspaper and magazine circulations. Sometimes historical information is useful. If you are working on a twentieth-century subject, you may find it helpful to use the enormous amount of information available about events in the twentieth century, organised by year. If you are writing about Eliot's poem The Waste Land (published in 1922) for example, you might consider it relevant to know about other events of that year (or the years when it was being written), and so you could look up 1922 in the index to the London newspaper The Times (the poem is set partly in London and was published there). In these indexes you will find information about countries, types of event  (e.g. crimes), about the arts (e.g. reviews) and about the subjects and terms of reference of contemporaneous public debate. As well as indexes for many newspapers, there are compendia such as Keesings Contemporary Archives ( ""factual reports on current affairs throughout the world, based on information abstracted from press, broadcasting, official and other sources"" , published from 1931 onwards). Sometimes a novel or poem gains some of its meaning by quoting or referring to another text. In these cases, writers may expect their readers instantly to recognise such ALLUSIONS. But there are changes in what readers know automatically, even leaving aside questions of education, social background, gender, ethnicity or age. A person in 1990 will have a different store of knowledge from a person in 1890, and even more different from a person in 1790. So information sources can stand in for what we do not automatically know. If you suspect a text is quoting another text, you can check by looking up what you take to be the key word of the quotation in a Dictionary of Quotations. If you think an allusion is being made to a Greek or Roman myth, you can try Lemprièe's Classical Dictionary or some other dictionary of Classical mythology. If you think a reference is being made to the Bible, you can use a concordance to the Bible. In many cases some of the work has been done for you by previous scholars; so, for example there is a book called Allusions in Ulysses (which lists allusions made in James Joyce's novel Ulysses). Finally, there are books which have information about many different kinds of topic, and which can often turn out to be useful in unpredictable ways. These include The Oxford Companion to Literature, where you will find information about authors, texts, literary movements, and general historical facts. The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature enables you to explore literary history by comparing juxtaposed commentary, quotation and pictures. The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language is a compendium of useful information about language, including language in literature. The original (but still available) Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable is an example of a nineteenth-century collection of somewhat idiosyncratically chosen historical, mythical and literary information; it is useful partly because of its eccentricity, in that it contains information you may not find elsewhere. And it would be wrong to overlook the very large general encyclopedias, such as The Encyclopedia Britannica. If, for example, you want to know about punctuation in the seventeenth century, marriage laws in nineteenth-century Canada, the history of the Elizabethan stage, or current theories of myth or symbol, this is one place well worth looking. Ignore the scepticism of those obsessed with ""definitive"" sources: the entries in Britannica are always good, and surprisingly detailed. 2.4 FINDING MORE TO READ Besides these almost standard reference sources, you will need to find more specific — and more specialised — ideas about what to read. One way of acquiring such ideas, of course, is to look on the shelves of a library (or bookshop), or in a publisher's or library catalogue, where you will find books gathered by subject and by author. Make yourself open to chance — often you will find things by accident while looking for something else, or when just browsing aimlessly. You may also like to look in anthologies. For example, the Oxford Book of Death will give you short texts relating to death, and selections from longer texts you might want to read all the way through if you are interested in the topic. If your library has a computerised catalogue, you may be able to get a list of all the books held on a particular subject matter. You can do this directly, if the catalogue has subject divisions, or indirectly by looking for all books with a particular word in the title. You could look for all books in the subject area ""feminism"" , for example, or all books with ""feminism"" or ""feminist"" in the title. BOOLEAN SEARCH techniques may be available in a computerised catalogue; these enable you to select all the entries which have, for instance, both ""feminism"" and ""Romanticism"" in the title (or close variants on these words). Another approach to finding more to read is to consult a bibliography, a list of books. One place to find such a list is at the back of a monograph or textbook. For most short coursework essays, this may well be enough. But you can also use specialised bibliographies. Many authors have whole bibliographies devoted to them, and there are bibliographies for particular subject areas (for example, Black British Literature. An Annotated Bibliography). The most comprehensive bibliography for literary studies is the Modern Language Association of America [MLA]international bibliography. Another, more selective and critical bibliography is The Year's Work in Modern Language Studies. (Notice that ""Modern Language"" in titles usually means literature as well as language, and looking in bibliographies for ideas about what to read is called a LITERATURE SEARCH — ""literature"" in this sense means ""the collection of what has been written"" .) A third approach is to look at ABSTRACTS. An abstract is a short summary of content. For example, a yearly volume called Abstracts of English Studies gives very short summaries of a large number of articles published in a year; there are indexes to help you find particular topics. Dissertation Abstracts International is another collection of abstracts, this time quite long abstracts of PhD dissertations. If you are writing an MA, MPhil, MLitt or PhD dissertation, you should look at this book to see what other people have written about the topic you are working on. You  can use abstracts as an indication of something you might want to read, or you can just read and learn from the abstracts themselves. Another way of finding useful or appropriate things to read is to look at library catalogues which have been published as books. In college and university libraries you will often find catalogues for other collections. These are particularly useful when the collections are subject-specific. For example, there is a published catalogue of the books in the Florida State University ""Shaw Childhood in Poetry collection"" ; this catalogue lists books of poems relating to childhood, together with lists of poems in the books, and even representative poems from the books — making it a bit like a dictionary of quotations on the topic. If your current interest happens to be in childhood in literature, this catalogue is an interesting place to browse. Once you start looking, you will probably find more than you have time to read. So you will need to be selective in what you decide to consult. Here are some ways of being selective. * Choose recent books first (they might tell you what earlier books have said). Check book dates generally, and ask yourself whether a source may actually be giving you an outdated perspective. * Look at the range of titles in the field and for topics which keep coming up. Make sure you read at least one book on each relevant topic. * If you have a book or article in your hands, check the contents page and preface or introduction: these will give you a sketch of the book's scope and argument. It is also useful to look at the bibliography or index to see what it includes and what it misses out. (Do the included terms correspond with what is in your view important, or the sense of what is important you have formed from what you have already read?) * Read the last page of the book or article: with any luck it will summarise what went before, so you can choose whether to read the whole volume. * Check the contents page and try to link up the entries into a developing narrative or argument. When you have used a bibliography to find the title of something to read, how do you then get your hands on it? If it is not in your library you may have to use inter-library loan, if this service is available to you. (In Britain all books published are kept in copyright libraries such as the British Library in London, and can in principle be borrowed by your library, though in practice they are not available to everyone.) In some cases, however, the elusive book which you need may in fact be hidden  in your own library. (A group of students who were asked to read the poem ""Lycidas"" by John Milton couldn't find it because it was ""not in the catalogue"" . What they needed to do was to look in Milton's Collected Poems or in an anthology such as The Oxford Book of Seventeenth-Century Verse, rather than expecting individual titles all to be listed separately in the catalogue.) Finally, anthologies exist for all kinds of text, so sometimes what you need can be found there. This is true even of critical essays: there are anthologies such as those in the Macmillan Casebook series or the Longman Critical Readers. 2.5 HOW TO READ A BOOK OR ARTICLE Finding your book or article is only the beginning, of course. Once you have it in your hands, there are a number of different ways of using it. Because you will often have more to read than you have time for, you need to develop ways of reading more quickly and efficiently. The techniques of scanning and skimming can both be used to gain a rough idea of what an article or book contains, so that you can read parts in more detail if you want to. You can SCAN, which involves just looking quickly at each page, to pick out anything which you recognise as being relevant to you, and which you can then read in detail (scanning involves looking for keywords). Or you can SKIM, which involves just reading the first sentence of every paragraph and anything prominent or highlighted (in this case, it is the general sense and flow of the book you are trying to absorb). Both of these reading techniques are examples of how reading is a selective activity. Even when you READ INTENSIVELY (that is, you focus on every word) you are still inevitably selective in what you understand or absorb. If you read an article or book twice you will probably be surprised by the many new things you discover the second time. It is a common experience in reading that you read something, then try to write about it; writing about it gives you new ideas, and so when you read the original again you find new things in it because of the new ideas you have brought to it. This suggests that books or articles which are important to your project should be read more than once (early on, and then again later in your study). Reading is an active process, one where what you bring to your reading affects what you get out of it: the more you know, the more you can understand. Don't go to books passively, expecting simply to absorb and to be informed. Constantly ask yourself what key questions reading this book is going to help to answer. As you read  through a book or long article, pause after each chapter or section and look back at any notes you have taken. Do they make sense? Do they provide facts or views you can use? Are there particular points you need to go back to, or will need to find out more about? 2.6 HOW TO KEEP NOTES Your reading will be useful only if you remember it and can do something with it. There are various ways of storing the results of your reading. You can buy the book, and write notes directly on it, or underline (or highlight) parts. You can photocopy relevant sections of the book or article. Alternatively, you can copy out parts of the book into your notes. Or you can try to restate passages of the book in your own words. Which of these you should do involves the basic decision whether you should copy the original words, or restate the content in your own words. The problem with keeping the original (e.g. as a photocopy, with sections highlighted) is that you haven't really done anything with it yet: you haven't assimilated it or made it your own, in the sense of fitting it with (and so allowing it to affect) your existing thoughts and knowledge. At some point, you will probably have to write out your own version of other people's ideas in the form of paraphrase or summary embedded in your own work; so it could be argued that you should do the rewriting from the outset, as you take your notes, in an effort to get at the ideas behind the words rather than just repeating the words themselves. The problem with this is that in doing so you are taking a risk: perhaps you are misunderstanding what you read, and so your notes become an incorrect version of what was said. One response to this objection, though, is that sooner or later you have to decide what someone means and how it is relevant to you; so you might as well take that decision consciously, while you have the book or article in front of you to check. However you make them, your notes are a record of what you have read. They may also be a record of your developing ideas. But you need to make sure you can find things again when you need them. This is one reason why cards (INDEX CARDS) are popular as a format for keeping notes. Index cards are easily handled and shuffled; they can be kept in alphabetised boxes, come in different colours, and can have a topic, keyword or reference written at the top, as an indication of what is on the card. These features make index cards easy to organise, and well-organised notes mean that you can find information more easily. One basic decision  you have to make is whether to index a card by writing at the top of the card a theme/keyword or a name of an author/title. You might for example have a card on the theme/keyword ""the sublime"" , including notes drawn from a number of different books. Or a card which contains only notes from Monk's book The Sublime: a Study of Critical Theories in Eighteenth-Century England. In general, the former method of organising by themes and keywords involves you more in doing analysis and thinking at the moment of reading, which is generally a good idea. You may also be able to store your notes on the equivalent of index cards on a computer (in a database, or in word-processing document files). Finding information in computerised notes is in principle much more efficient because you can search for every use of a particular word throughout your notes. On the other hand, on a computer screen you can only see a small amount of information at any given time, whereas with index cards you can lay them out across a table or on the floor for an overview. You also have to be able to have the computer with you when you take the notes, which is not always easy to arrange. In whatever format you keep them, the notes you make need to be clear; if they are not self-explanatory at the time you write them, they are unlikely to be intelligible later, when your memory of working on the particular book or topic has faded. So read over your notes once you have made them, and edit them until they are as comprehensible as possible without reference back to the source work. It is also generally a good idea to keep your notes short; while you may want to keep a record of everything that might prove useful, your notes will seem unhelpful if you feel swamped with redundant information when you come to refer to them later. 2.7 KEEPING A RECORD OF WHERE YOU FOUND SOMETHING At the beginning of this chapter, we suggested that when you write you use what other people have written. One of the conventions of research — which we discuss in more detail below, in Chapter 5 — is that you must enable your reader to find again what you have read (and in any case, it is useful for you to be able to find again what you have read). So you need to write down enough details of a book or article, or any other source, to enable it to be found again. In some cases it can be difficult or even impossible to find texts again (for example if the text is a lecture, or a television programme), but you should still keep details of them as fully as  possible, so that your reader knows exactly where ideas or words come from. The information you need to keep for everything you read includes the following. (You will find such information usually at the beginning of a book — though some books have details of publication on the last page instead.) (a) The author's full name. Write the family name first, as this will decide where the work will go in an alphabetical list. (b) Any other people involved, other than an author. There might for example be an editor, compiler or translator. (c) The full title — and subtitle — of the work. Put a colon between the title and the subtitle, even if there isn't one in the original. Underline the title of a book, and put an article's title in single quotation marks. (d) The name of the publisher, the place where it was published, and the date of publication — all for the edition you have in your hands. Often books will have a list of different places; the convention is to choose only the first. In some cases you may want to add further information: books are published in Cambridge England and Cambridge USA, so saying just ""Cambridge"" may not be helpful; add country details if you think there is a possibility of confusion. (e) If the text is an article in a journal or a chapter in an edited book or anthology, keep details about the collection in which you found it; for a journal article, note the volume and issue number, and the page numbers on which the article appears. (f) Sometimes books or articles exist in several different versions. If you are not using the original version, you should say so (e.g. by noting ""second edition"" or ""reprinted version"" or ""facsimile"" ). You should keep details of the original version, if you can find them. For an article in an anthology, for instance, you need to keep details of the journal in which it originally appeared. For a FACSIMILE edition (a photographic reprint of an old book), note both information relating to the current edition and also information relating to the original edition. If a book is a translation, keep information about the original title, publisher, etc. (g) Usually you will refer to or quote from a particular passage in a book or article; in this case, note the page number. Because literary texts exist in different editions it can be more helpful instead to note the chapter number, act and scene number, line number, etc. (and of course, you should indicate the exact edition you are using). (h) For your own benefit, also keep a record of where you found the book (which library and the call number), in case you need to consult it again. There are detailed guidelines, for example in The MLA Style Manual or the MHRA Style Book, to tell you how to deal with all kinds of complicated cases. Below, in Chapters 5 and 7, we enlarge on what we have said here, as we make suggestions about how to present references in footnotes and booklists appended to your essay or dissertation. But note in the meantime that published rules don't always help you. Often you need to work things out for yourself. Here is an example of the need to improvise. We wish to refer to an anthology of poetry and prose which we have open in front of us. At the beginning of the book, on the verso (left-hand) page, it says Oxford University Press. London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, New York, Toronto, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay Humphrey Milford, Publisher to the University On the recto (right-hand) page it says: A Book of the Sea. Selected and arranged by Lady Sybil Scott Oxford. At the Clarendon Press. 1918 The first problem is: how to record the name of the author. Should it be ""Scott, Lady Sybil"" or just ""Scott, Sybil"" ? We would be inclined to use the first, because it gives a better sense of the feel of the anthology; but this is a fairly arbitrary decision, where rule-books do not help. How should we list the author's role? We could say simply ""(edited)"" but perhaps we should take the title page at its word and say instead ""(selection and arrangement)"" . Is the publisher Oxford University Press or Humphrey Milford or Clarendon Press? (Actually, it is Oxford University Press, but we can be sure of this only because we already know something about this publisher.) Finally, is the place of publication London (the first in the list under the publisher's name) or Oxford? Again, we choose Oxford, but only because this is usually given as the place of publication for Oxford University Press books. So our notes say: Scott, Lady Sybil (selection and arrangement), A Book of the Sea (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1918). Getting to this stage involves some active interpretation (and some fairly random decisions too). As usual in writing, following rules by itself achieves little. 2.8 USING A COMPUTER TO FIND AND STORE INFORMATION Computers are particularly good for finding, storing and retrieving information. This can be illustrated in the context of literary studies with one or two examples, starting with the advantage of using a computerised library catalogue. A non-computerised library catalogue is likely to be a collection of cards, each a record about a book, in alphabetical order according to the author's family name. If you know just the title but not the author's name, you may be out of luck. In a computerised catalogue, on the other hand, you can in principle search according to any aspect of a record about a book. This is because computerised information is not as rigidly organised in advance, which means that you can search through it in any way you please. Computerised library catalogues are just one example of the many forms of computerised bibliographical information which are available. The Modern Language Association Bibliography from 1985 to the present is available on compact disc, so you can do much quicker searches than if you had to haul out each year's book one by one. Increasingly, literary texts are becoming available in computerised form. For example, the Oxford Text Archive is a collection of computerised texts, each of which you can buy on floppy disc for the price of a printed copy. Shakespeare's works are available on disc from many sources, as is the Bible. Compact discs are available which contain a corpus of a whole century of poetry on a single disc. And it is possible to make new electronic texts by scanning printed texts into a computer. The advantage of having a text in computerised form is that you can find things in it very easily using computerised search techniques, and you can do more complicated searches than you ever could with a printed concordance. Let's say you are interested in the opposition of love and hate in Shakespeare's play All's Well that Ends Well. Using a Complete Shakespeare on CD, you can look for all cases where these two words are used within, say, five lines of each other; and you'll get your answer within a minute or so. Another useful resource is offered by the possibility of putting very large dictionaries onto a single compact disc. The full Oxford English Dictionary is available on compact disc; and with it you can do far more extensive searches for information than the printed book allows. For example, if you are interested in the word ""love"" , with the book version of the OED you can look up ""love"" and you will be given definitions and illustrative quotations. In the compact-disc OED, on the other hand, you can look for the word ""love"" not just in the entry for ""love"" but in every  entry in the whole dictionary; the search will find ""love"" in any quotation anywhere in the entire dictionary. A search of this size is impossible with the printed OED, where you are restricted to just those quotations including ""love"" which the original editors decided to put into the entry for ""love"" . It is likely that computerized storage and retrieval facilities will take on an increasing importance in literary studies; so it is worth exploring them whenever you can. It should be said, nevertheless, that powerful search techniques, across such large databases, will still only contribute effectively to your essay-writing or research if you maintain a clear sense of what you are looking for and why — a guiding principle which is itself independent of the technology. 2.9 USING YOUR SUPERVISOR The role of a supervisor varies, depending on the level of work you are doing and the conventions of supervision for the department you are in. The role will hardly ever be one of telling you what to do; instead, the supervisor reviews what you have done. This means that as a student who is being supervised it is you who have to be proactive rather than reactive. Being proactive means negotiating with your supervisor about what you expect from her or him, instead of just accepting the terms (often not actually made explicit) on which supervision is offered. Prepare questions and an informal agenda for each meeting, so that when it is over you can be certain that — alongside all other new questions which are raised — you have asked or raised all the issues you wanted to. Try to arrange for a written record of what has been agreed for the next meeting, so that you can work to an explicit plan. Take an active role in asking for appointments; most kinds of research benefit from discussion at least every month or so. Do not let the channel of communication with your supervisor close — even if you are behind and would rather not have to face the situation of explaining why. Staying in communication allows for discussion and possible help, whereas losing touch will categorise you only as someone who is failing to meet deadlines. Always bring something with you to a supervision: ideas which you have written down, an outline of an essay, a text you want to talk about, or a plan of action. Your supervisor's approach and enthusiasm are likely to vary according to how motivated and organised you are. You will get better help if you have outlines and ideas for the supervisor to react to; experiment with your ideas and see what reactions you get, rather than waiting to produce ideas that you are sure fit in with an established approach. See your supervisor as a facilitator or notional ""editor"" /adviser of your work, rather than as a teacher who will inform you, or as an authority. Ask for comments on drafts of work you have written, and discuss those comments, even if this means talking about apparently negative judgements on your work so far. Feedback provided by your tutor is supposed to be helpful and constructive ( ""formative feedback"" ), and you stand to gain most from having comments clarified — even deciphered — where necessary, and ensuring through discussion that you understand the general perspective from which criticisms or comments are made. It is also useful to carry out your own critical analysis of an essay you have completed. A week or more after writing, you are likely to have sufficient detachment to examine your work as a reader, rather than as its writer. Add a list of your own comments to your tutor's feedback, for future reference. 2.10 PLANNING YOUR TIME Be realistic about time in your planning. And suit yourself — everyone works differently, and your personal best working patterns may well be different from those other people might expect from you. The aim should be to develop your own potential, not to regulate your working habits to a conventional norm. Allow for unexpected breaks such as days when libraries are closed, delays while materials arrive through the post, days when you don't feel like working, etc. And create breaks deliberately. For example, you should allow for creating variation in your working patterns. Read for a while, then do some writing or some research browsing in a library; this can reduce the effect of strain or tiredness with long bouts of writing, something which is particularly important for health reasons if you work at a computer. Remember that finishing off (e.g. by adding footnotes or bibliographic references) always takes longer than you anticipate, so allow enough time for this. Be careful with deadlines: some are notional (and extensions are possible); others are fixed and absolute, with the result that non-completion on schedule can mean failure. Check the rules to find out which of these your deadline is. 2.11 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter we have shown how writing an essay depends on the manipulation of raw materials collected for the purpose, including editions of literary works, critical essays, information gathered from reference sources and advice sought from teachers or supervisors. The work of writing an essay is greatly reduced if your preparatory stages are carried out thoroughly. This involves deciding what it is you are looking for before you start general reading, and, equally important, assessing why you need to read particular works or sources you intend to consult. Keeping clear and concise notes of what you have read enables you to organise your essay without having to refer constantly back to the original sources. Your notes form a bridge between the works you are studying and the outline and early drafts of the essay you are trying to write. Specific suggestions * Decide which parts of a text to focus on particularly (e.g. beginning, ending, title, etc.)(see p. 32). * Make an informed choice about which version of a text to use; try to use a critical edition (see p. 33). * Beware of quoting from secondary sources, particularly from textbooks (p. 34). * Find out what information sources are available to you, and be imaginative in how you use them (see pp. 34–40). * Look for ideas on the shelves and in the catalogue of your library, in bibliographies, in anthologies and also in bookshops and publishers' catalogues (see p. 38). * Be open to chance discoveries (see p. 38). * Don't read everything in the same way (see pp. 39–41). * Take notes, but don't necessarily copy directly from the original when you do so (see pp. 41–2). * When you take notes, keep a full record of all sources (see pp. 42–4). * Use the flexibility of computerised texts and search techniques if you can (see pp. 45–6). * Take the initiative and negotiate with your supervisor for the most helpful arrangement (see pp. 46–7). * Vary your working patterns (see p. 47). Exercises (1) Choose one literary text which you might work on which is  representative, plus one which is well-known, plus one which is neglected (see 2.1). Explain why each text might be interesting to work on. (2) ""Kitchen-sink drama"" is a name used for a particular group of plays written in Britain in the late 1950s and 1960s. Look up ""kitchen-sink"" in the Oxford English Dictionary (second edition), and explain how the entry could help you put together an essay on kitchen-sink drama. (3) Pick a brief passage from a poem you believe to be famous. Underline what seem to you to be the main or key words in the passage, including all names and any words beginning with capital letters. Look these words up in the Oxford English Dictionary (complete version, not the compact or shorter version); in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable; in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Literature; in the Encyclopedia Brittanica; and in whichever other relevant reference sources are available to you. Now imagine you are an editor, annotating the passage for a student edition. As you add explanatory notes, offer all the help you would hope to find, as a reader, in an annotated edition if you yourself were studying this particular text for the first time. (4) Pick a work you have recently read or are in the process of reading. Look up, in all the reference works available to you, entries for: — the author — the title of the work — the main characters in the work — the places referred to — any dates referred to. Go through the list, asessing what contributions (if any) each new piece of information makes to your understanding of the work. (5) Make a sample set of ""notes"" on a critical work you have recently read to help with an essay task, laying out your notes in two columns. In the left column, put what you consider to be all the main points made in the book. In the right column, note down all the points which would be relevant to or useful in your essay in particular. Compare the two columns. (6) Draw up a contract which you think would represent the ideal division of responsibilities between yourself and your supervisor. Discuss it with your supervisor."
ACA ACA-J57-002 -9.81 "CONTINUITY AND CHANGE The British Political Culture CONTINUITY AND CHANGE, as we have observed, are features of every political system. In order to understand the extent and nature of that change one has to generate some analytically useful framework. What the opening chapter did was to provide largely descriptive material of the society with which we are concerned. It did not generate a framework that would help us understand the nature of continuity and change in Britain. The purpose of this chapter is to provide such a framework. The emphasis of the chapter will be on the political culture. As I shall seek to show, however, that culture cannot be divorced from the constraints of history and of physical and spatial resources. Each has had a significant impact on the other. The impact has not been in one direction only: the political culture has served to shape political perceptions and actions, and hence to influence the nation's political history. Conversely, those actions have been constrained by the experiences of history. They have also been constrained by Britain's geographic location and limited resources. A number of problems have to be borne in mind. As we shall see, there are problems inherent in trying to give shape to such an abstract concept as political culture. There is the danger of tautology and of failing to distinguish between how a system operates and the way in which people believe it should operate. There is the problem also of attempting to discern the  cause-and-effect relationships among culture, history, and resources. The problem here is analogous to that embodies in the familiar conundrum ""Which came first, the chicken or the egg?""  The existence of a stable political culture in Britain has been ascribed by some to the effectiveness of government. But what has enabled government to be effective? Has it been a distinctive political culture, citizens being prepared to acquiesce in and, when called on, to support the demands made of them by government? If so, what explains the existence of such a political culture? Is not a partial explanation the effectiveness of government? The problem is an acute one in the case of Britain, given the absence of any clear point of departure. Where does English, Scottish, or Welsh history begin? At what point is a political culture discernible? The problem is largely an insuperable one, and all we can do at this stage is to bear it in mind. Fortunately, it does not present an insurmountable obstacle; as I shall seek to show, the importance of the relationship is one of mutual reinforcement. What, then, is the British political culture? How important have been the constraints of history and of resources? How does it compare with other polities? And is it, as some writers have suggested, in a state of collapse? Political culture is a vague abstract concept that has been subject to various definitions. In its simplest form, it may be described as denoting the emotional and attitudinal environment within which a political system operates. Various political scientists have sought to define and identify different types of political culture. Almond and Verba, for example, identified three ideal types: participant, subject, and parochial. Others have sought to generate criteria by which to assess the distinctive features of a political culture. THE POLITICAL CULTURE In his work on political oppositions in western democracies, Robert Dahl observed that patterns of opposition may have something to do with widely shared cultural premises. He noted that four kinds of culturally derived orientations toward politics seem to have a bearing on the pattern of opposition. Those four orientations can usefully be employed to help understand and explain attitudes not just toward political opposition in Britain but to the political culture as a whole. They enable one to draw out the distinctive features of that culture, in a more useful manner than does the framework provided by others, and to consider the impact of both history and resources. Those four orientations, listed not in the order provided by Dahl but in the order I believe to be most significant to an understanding to British political culture, are toward (1) problem-solving,(2) the political system,(3) cooperation and individuality, and (4) other people. Orientation toward Problem-Solving Giovanni Sartori has distinguished two approaches to problem-solving: the empirical and the rational. The empirical approach is concerned with what is and what can be seen and touched, proceeding on the basis of testing and retesting and largely rejecting dogma and abstract or coherent grand designs for change. The rationalist approach, by contrast, is concerned with abstraction rather than facts, stressing the need for deductive consistency and tending to be dogmatic and definitive. Dahl states: ""While the empirical approach takes the attitude that if a program does not work in practice there must be something wrong about the theory, the rationalist will retort that what is true in theory must also be true in practice — that it is the practice, not the theory, that is wrong.""  France has been identified as employing a rationalist approach. Germany and Italy, to some extent, tend also to find such an approach useful. Britain and the United States, by contrast, are seen as the exemplars of an empirical approach. Indeed, it is my contention that this approach is most marked in the British case and that it constitutes the most significant aspect of British political culture. Although more oriented toward an empirical approach, the United States has exhibited some elements of the rationalist. While tempered by experience and (according to Beard) self-interest, the framers of the United States Constitution were informed by Lockean values and sought to impose a political framework in line with a Lockean conception of society. Those values and that conception of society have permeated the American consciousness, so much so that they have largely gone unstated. They have been so pervasive and so self-evident that there has been little point in articulating them. Hence, the United States might be described as being oriented toward a mix of the empirical and the rationalist, albeit with the former being clearly the more dominant of the two. Britain, by contrast, has a distinct orientation toward the empirical approach. Even the political system, however strong the attachment to it, tends to be justified in pragmatic terms. Democracy, having been implemented in largely pragmatic fashion, has been lauded on the grounds that ""it works.""  The point has been well put by Vivien Hart in comparing American and British approaches: ""In America,"" she wrote, ""the emphasis has been on what democracy is and should be, while Britain has been characterised by a more pragmatic and less urgent emphasis on what democracy is and can be.""  Empiricism seems appropriate to the English consciousness. Instinct, trial and error, and incremental change are the essence of the English approach to problem-solving.  ""I believe in the instinctive wisdom of our well-tried democracy,"" declared Churchill in 1945 — shortly before going down to election defeat. Such an orientation to problem-solving has been a distinctive feature of English political culture for many centuries, discernible, I would suggest, since at least the thirteenth century. It is an approach that has informed political actions and hence the political history of the country. An empirical orientation has in turn been reinforced by the experience of history — it is the approach that has always been employed and no external constraints have managed to force themselves on the nation to generate conditions in which a rationalist approach would be possible. In the wake of the War of Independence, Americans were able to sit down and generate a political system from first principles. Invasions by foreign powers and subsequent liberation (or absence of liberation) have put other states in similar positions. England, by contrast, has never been faced with or sought such an opportunity. The closest it came was during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell in the seventeenth century. When that failed, the country resorted as far as possible to the conditions prevailing prior to its creation. English history is scattered with philosophers generating theories that have failed to find congenial soil in the nation's consciousness. Ideologies have been either discarded or else molded to fit with the experience of history. Prevailing theories, once they no longer seem appropriate, have been dispensed with. The act of dispensing with them has not always met with common assent nor has it always been smooth — the English historical landscape is scattered with periods of violence and upheaval — but once the dispensing process is achieved, it has largely been accepted. Hankering after the old order is congenial to some minds, but seeking to revert by force or civil unrest to the status quo ante is not. In the English perception, empiricism is both a descriptive and a prescriptive term. To the Englishman, it is both what is and what he believes always has been. Orientation toward the political system may be classified as allegiant when attitudes, feelings, and evaluations are favorable to the political system; apathetic or detached when feelings and evaluations are neutral; and alienated when such feelings and evaluations are unfavorable. Italy and France have been cited as examples of political cultures that generate alienation and a large measure of apathy. West Germany has been put forward as having a culture that generates detachment. In contrast, Britain and the United States are among those countries cited as exhibiting a strong allegiant orientation. Orientation toward the Political System Almond and Verba found that evaluation of the political system in Britain was the product of a mix of participant and deferential orientations. A participant orientation was developed in Britain (citizens being oriented to the input as well as the output side of the political system, believing that  they enjoyed access to it), but it was one adapted to an existing deference to the independent authority of government. The participant orientation in Britain, unlike that in the United States, did not displace the deferential, it remained important. The participant orientation finds expression in citizens' beliefs that they can influence government at both the national and local level. Although Almond and Verba found few people in their survey who actually sought to exert such influence, the proportion who believed that they could exert influence was significant. Of British respondents, 57% said that they could influence national and local government. (The figure for the United States was 67%.) Only 19% of those questioned felt that they had no influence at national and local levels. (The figure for the United States was 15 per cent.) By contrast, of Germans, Italians, and Mexicans interviewed, more believed they had no influence at national and local level than believed that they had. Only 25% of Italians, for example, believed that they could influence national and local government, and 47% said they had no such influence. Deference to the authority of government has found expression in a number of ways. It has been shown in a voluntary compliance with basic political laws. Criminal acts tend to be antisocial rather than conscious acts against ""the state.""  (Indeed, the concept of ""the state"" is one that is not well entrenched in English consciousness.) There has been little overt opposition to the parliamentary form of government in Britain. Some may want to modify its form but do not challenge the principle of it, nor do they seek to change its form through unlawful and certainly not violent means. When government authority has been challenged citizens have expressed themselves in favor of maintaining that authority. When called on by government to act in time of war, citizens have been prepared to respond. Such deference has often been seen as allied with a social deference, citizens according certain skills of government to those drawn from a particular group. Walter Bageho, in his classic work The English Constitution, identified England as a ""deferential nation,"" one that had a structure of its own.  ""Certain persons,"" he wrote, ""are by common consent agreed to be wiser than others, and their opinion is, by consent, to rank for much more than its numerical value.""  Such deference, though possibly weakened, survived into the era of mass suffrage and the democratic ideal. It has been seen as a significant feature of contemporary Britain and has been variously offered as a partial explanation of the continuing success of the Conservative party and its socially atypical leadership. Such deference, though, has been contingent rather than certain. It has been based on a reciprocity between governors and governed. The populace has deferred to the independent authority of government and to those who occupy government in return for the satisfaction of expectations. Those expectations have covered the substance of policies (improving material well-being, for example) as well as the form of government. Almond and Verba, for example, found that an overwhelming majority of Britons expected equal treatment from politicians and from bureaucrats. Conversely, those to whom citizens accord deference have been characterized by having an in-bred sense of duty. A stress on responsibilities as well as rights has been a significant and long-standing feature of the British culture and has been well imbued by a large part of the nation's political elite. A paternalistic concern for the well-being of the nation has been a feature of most if not all monarchs and has been associated with a particular and often predominant tradition within the Conservative party. As long as the political system has been able to maintain the capacity to meet the demands and expectations of citizens, an allegiant orientation has been demonstrated by citizens. The longer the system has been able to do this and the longer people have been socialized into accepting the efficacy of the system, the stronger and more enduring the allegiance has been. In Almond and verba's survey, more Britons expressed pride in their governmental and political institutions than in any other feature of the nation that was mentioned. The same pride was found in Americans, on a larger scale. (Of Americans, 85% expressed pride in their institutions, compared with 46% of Britons.) In stark contrast, only 7% of Germans expressed pride in their governmental and political institutions, and the figure for Italians was 3%. Some cultures emphasize the values of cooperating with others, conciliating opposing views, and being prepared to compromise and submerge one's own ideas in a broader and more popularly acceptable solution. Others, by contrast, stress the virtues of maintaining the distinctiveness, ideas, and integrity of the individual, such virtues being considered superior to those of compromise and cooperation. Orientation toward Cooperation and Individuality France and Italy have been cited as examples of countries in which the maintenance of group and individual integrity is stressed in both the general culture and in political life. Britain and the United States are included among those countries in which the political culture emphasizes the virtues of compromise and conciliation, without threatening personal integrity. The Anglo-American perception was well expressed by Edmund Burke in 1775.  ""All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act,"" he declared, ""is founded on compromise and barter.""  In Britain there is an almost instinctive distaste for conflict, both in personal relationships and in political life. The formal political framework facilitates an adversary relationship among political parties, but the underlying reality is a quest for compromise. Parties play according to the rules of  the constitutional game. Similar observations can be made about groups in industry and in society generally. There is a penchant, almost, for resolving disputes by discussion, by sitting around a table and ironing out one's differences. It is an orientation compatible with the others already identified and it is eminently congenial to a society that stresses the responsibilities as well as the rights of the individual. It remains an orientation that Britons not only find congenial but also take as the source of a certain pride. A belief that one can have faith and confidence in others has been put forward as a culturally rooted phenomenon, with potentially important implications for political life. Research by Morris Rosenberg has shown that ""faith in people"" is related to democratic and internationalist values and attitudes. In their study, Almond and Verba found that the Americans and the British ""tend to be consistently most positive about the safety and responsiveness of the human environment.""  The Germans and the Italians, by contrast, were found to be more negative, and the Mexicans inconsistent. Orientation toward Other People Trust in one's fellow countrymen remains a significant feature of contemporary British society. A Gallup Poll in 1980 found that 85% of respondents considered other Britons to be very or fairly trustworthy. The experience of history may have helped to consolidate such a sense of trust. Britons have stood successfully shoulder-to-shoulder in order to win battles abroad and to repel foreign invaders from their shores. During the Second World War, the nation did not have to contend with a significant fifth column or with the equivalent of Vichy collaborators. There is little or nothing in recent history that would give Britons cause to distrust their compatriots. Similarly, the experience of history, island isolation, and shared values may serve to explain differing levels of trust that Britons have in other people. Britons tend to retain trust in the inhabitants of countries in which Britain has had or retains colonial interests; countries that share a common language, values, and (in some cases) ancestry; and countries that have stood together in times of crisis. There are strong emotional ties to old Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. There is also a strong sense of closeness to the United States. Of respondents in the Gallup Poll in 1980, 70% regarded Americans as very or fairly trustworthy. (Only the Swiss and the Dutch received marginally higher ratings.) Another poll a year later asked respondents the extent to which they thought they could trust certain countries as allies in the event of war. The proportion responding that they thought they could trust the United Sates ""a great deal"" was 62% (up from 45% in 1975), a figure not matched by any other country: the closest was Norway, which 37% thought they could trust to the same extent. The two polls revealed lower levels of trust in those countries and  people that historically have been Britain's enemies. To the island inhabitants of Britain, such peoples remain distant (though the English Channel constitutes now more a psychological than a physical barrier), with alien cultures, different interests, and different thought processes. Englishmen and Scotsmen, as Anthony King observed, have tended not to think like Europeans nor to think of themselves as Europeans. In the 1980 Gallup Poll, only 32% of the Britons questioned regarded the French as very or fairly trustworthy. The Russians scored 18%. (The West Germans, perhaps surprisingly, scored 60%.) Only 6% of those questioned would trust the French a great deal as allies in time of war, 4% would trust the Spanish, 4% the Italians, and only 3% the Turks. Again, the Germans did better, 22% being prepared to trust them a great deal. Finally, 47% said they would trust the Italians ""not at all,"" and 45% gave a similar response for the French. Despite British membership of the European Communities, there is an important sense in which Britain and certainly the British still look westward across the Atlantic rather than eastward over the English channel. And despite the travails of recent times, trust in one's fellow countrymen and a discriminating, possibly confident, perception of other people remain significant features of the British political culture. The political culture of Britain may then be characterized, in broad terms, as having the four orientations identified: empirical in terms of problem-solving and change, allegiant in terms of the political system, cooperative in making decisions, and trusting with relation to fellow countrymen and allies. These, it is important to stress, are generalizations — there are always individuals or subcultures that may not have such orientations. What is important is that they are and remain the orientations of most Britons, both at the mass and the elite level. A DECLINING CULTURE? The strength of the culture may be said to lie in the convergence of these orientations — that is, they are compatible with and reinforce one another , and similarly are compatible with and are reinforced by the experience of history. The stress on cooperation and compromise, an emphasis compatible with an empirical approach to change, has facilitated the integration of groups and individuals into the political system. Such integration may be seen as reinforcing an allegiant rather than a neutral or alienated orientation to the political system. History, as we have mentioned, has been kind: the country has staved off invasion by its enemies, and the resources have been available for government to make and meet commitments in response to changing demands and expectations. As a result, it has been possible to interpret the experience of history as justifying or reinforcing an attachment  to empirical problem-solving and to the virtues of cooperation and trust. The interplay of these variables generated what Almond and Verba characterized as ""the civic culture,""  ""a pluralistic culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it.""  What of the civic culture today? My argument is simply stated: Although subject to modification, the civic culture remains. What has been the subject of radical, almost revolutionary, change over the past decade or so has not been the civic culture but the perceptions of that culture. In short, it has not changed as much as observers think it has. I do not argue that the political culture of Britain remains unchanged. The culture not only allows for change, usually incremental but occasionally radical, but itself can and does change. In good British fashion, however, that change has tended to be piecemeal rather than comprehensive. Some values, attitudes and emotions have been subject to modification over time, but the essential orientations outlined above have not been discarded. They remain the orientations that converge to form the predominant element of the British political culture. What has changed, and changed radically over the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, has been the perception of that culture. Analyses of the British political culture have swung, pendulum fashion, from one extreme to the other. At times of apparent stability, contentment, and political success, there has been a tendency to see the political culture in idealized terms, to hold it aloft and laud it as a culture to be admired and possibly even envied. Although Almond and Verba drew attention to some of the inconsistencies and problems inherent in the civic culture, it was nonetheless difficult not to ascribe positive connotations to that culture. There are a number of problems inherent in the political culture. A disposition to incremental change can deflect one from considering or even comprehending wider and more fundamental problems. The combination of an empirical orientation and historical continuity has produced a political system that is complex and disparate. While the American federal system has been likened to a marble cake, the British political system can be likened to a patchwork quilt. It may look to some extent like the original, it may even retain traces of the original, but the many pieces that make the whole were added at different times and have been the subject of change and much repair work. It includes structures that (according to some observers) have facilitated policy discontinuity — a discontinuity not incompatible with an empirical orientation to change — yet comprises such an interdependent complex of political bodies that it has become increasingly difficult for government to govern and to initiate radical and comprehensive change. Such difficulty has been exacerbated by the desire to resolve problems by compromise. Problems that cannot be resolved by reasoned debate have tended to be ignored in the hope that they will go away. Such inherent problems tend to be discounted, ignored, or even interpreted in a favorable light at times when the political system appears to be successfully meeting the demands and expectations of the populace. When the system appears to be malfunctional, usually at times of economic difficulty for the country, some commentators identify such inherent problems as providing at least a partial explanation for the system's poor showing. In the latter half of the 1970s, for example, policy discontinuity arising from an electoral and political system that encouraged an ""adversary style"" of politics was offered as a partial explanation for Britain's poor economic performance. Other commentators have sought to identify the nation's problems not in terms of the effect of some aspects of the political culture but as agents generating and reflecting a decline in the culture itself. In the 1970s and early 1980s, a number of observers began to chart a decline in the civic culture. In 1982, on the basis of some survey evidence, Samuel Beer concluded that ""it is no exaggeration to speak of the decline in the civic culture as a"" collapse """" . He argued that as old institutions failed to meet new expectations, so legitimacy in government would falter and trust in its equity and effectiveness would decline. He hypothesized and sought to show that the consequences of this included a greater self-assertion by participants, a decline of leadership, a weakening of party government, and a loosening of the nexus of class and party.  ""In an ironic sense,"" Beer declared,""Britain is maintaining its leadership. As it once showed the way toward democratic success, today it blazes the trail toward democratic failure."" While Beer's hypothesis is plausible as to the effect of institutions that fail to meet new expectations on legitimacy in government, it is arguable as to the extent to which such a failure to meet expectations has taken place. This is a point to which I shall return in the concluding chapter. Although government capacity to meet expectations has declined, its capacity to meet expectations in the past built up a body of diffuse support, support that now exists independently of particular failures to meet demands. Furthermore, there is evidence that the expectations themselves may be changing, converging more with the capacity of the system to meet them. Certainly, it will be my case that the political culture has neither declined nor been threatened to the extent suggested by Beer and other Jeremiahs. Certain institutions may be under threat (as subsequent chapters will show) but not in a manner inconsistent with the existing political culture. The civic culture may be weakened but it has not collapsed. Its position is similar to that of Mark Twain: reports of its death would be greatly exaggerated. As I shall seek to show, the political culture remains predominantly an allegiant one, and the important question to be addressed is not ""why has there been a decline in the civic culture?"" but rather ""why has that decline not been greater?""

It hadn't? No! Well they should have shouldn't they now? Well I, I thought that. I said to Lyndsey I'm sure they're supposed to have plugs on. I don't think it comes into force till nineteen ninety three. Ah! Yeah. Well, it's bad. They  Yes. should have them on. Yes. Definitely! Yeah. Yeah. But Lyndsey was saying her answer machine    Oh! Excuse me. That's the tea. Her answer machine  er  she's got two answer machines cos  she so when the other wo she kept having a lot of trouble with it, kept breaking down and it'd go away for three weeks and she'd be without it Yeah. so she's got two, I think now. And, she said the plug that goes into the  from the answer machine goes into the thing Yeah. she said  er it went, the plug went wrong. So she can't take the plug off. Tt. Oh! You cannot take the plug off at all. No they're moulded on aren't they? So she's gotta take, she took it back, she took it back.

That was alright . Well, you know, it's, it's not a very, was it on the road? No, never. Where? I see, well . I know, because you know, it's not very .

She's a very old lady, distinguished looking. Very old lady , yes. Well have you seen her?

We needed artist who were painting cats. Aha. And she had, she was responsible, I mean she was er, representative for two of the paintings in Belgium so that's why I'm . Yes, so you're painting cats? Yes. Yes. All two, all the two of them. Oh, yes.. Yes. So, look, I have to hid it from Patrick otherwise he will eat them all.. Well he has  to eat. . Have to hid it. Well then have to hid it from me too. Alright, take some, and then I hid it. . Here have some . shocking,going to take some away. Shall we need some plastic sacks? One . In the morning, all day. Nine thirty. Not all day? Three hours? Three hours. That's it. From nine thirty until half past twelve. The little  analysis and communication board. Oh my grief. How many , maybe that  simple, very simple  eh? And what is it really? What is meant by that? It is, about comparing political, sociological, economic novels. Well, what do you mean ? Great communications, great . How can you compare, how can you apply pluralism, imperialism. Oh my god, can't you really find . Which is? . or a corporate system, how can they apply to communications? I still don't know any . Okay, so,. Give me an example. Erm, alright. For example, when you talk of, imperialism, when you look at, when we, we've study it from a , erm, quite a few, so it means that  that capitalism  supply and, but the problem is, that, although it creates supply it laboured people who worked, yeah Yeah. cannot buy it because it's too expensive for them. So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company, what you could call it period, for example, erm I see. Let's Maybe become export, become  does it? Alright, let's see the French , mm, mm, mm, yes. Well . So for example, I don't know, erm,, let's take an example,,, the French, erm multinational,tele telecommunications Yeah. National. Do you know , you will find here, that they say . Yeah, so you better  if you have . I haven't . You don't, okay. Multinationals, they have erm,, doing much better abroad than it is doing in France. Okay, well . Because the French cannot always buy what   Alright, alright. so that's why it's only period. Well you can call it export too, but export is . That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known, and, makes itself sell at much a  than in its, in its own country, so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower, most European and  have a monopoly tower  Yes. in not only Holland but in Germany. Yes, quite. Belgium  Yes, yes. And so when you, so it means that the Dutch are leaders, so it's, it's kind of, that's how putting up the communications empire . In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is. Mm, mm. Broader than all over Europe. Mm. That's why it's called imperialism. Ah yes. So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire.

That's fine, well I have to, to make a, have to write a little letter and, and, that's . And I wasn't sure of the work any more, but Yes, you mix it up . No, no. Really, no. No , it's quite a  apart. Yeah. It's much harder, I mean I simply , Swiss German, than Dutch Yeah, really? Aha. cos I practice more it. Yeah, yeah. No, I, I really. . Talking yeah. talking . . You know I still keep the Italian  you know , it's more  than French, at that time, and, well I worked in , I was, I was really quite good at it, but now, I just lost it. First of all I never hear it any more on the continent I can't seem to hear the radio, you hear some, you know,put on the radio and you have a , Brussels already , he had nothing at all. But don't you think that  Oh no  he would come back quick. I don't know anybody, aperitif, and the and all that stuff, you know, the exception. No,And I, I . Aha, aha I told myself, I had to force myself not to. I  at once, Stefan, there was an , I was  anything, just . So a lawyer came, and of course I had my own office , confidential stuff, so he wanted to give it to me. , and  in the machine or something, I had  you know, I never know, you have quite a few words which aren't any French or . one language, one  and the others have two or two . Or else, I . Yeah. And so I thought you . You have . Common . Common? Common. No it's too . As well. Yes. The French. Yes. I see, is it? Yes,. I know you're right, now it's imperative  with one  and it's with two . Yes. . That's what I mean. poor chap, he's, he's getting furious and  and there are hundreds of . Two S's you know and French you don't marks the difference, Italian you do say that you have double quotes,.. Writing I don't, I don't think she'd, she can write it there, I don't know. Italian . Yeah, and she ever uses it, why doesn't she forget it? Well I think she uses it quite often, you know, I mean  Where, where? at the office, or the Italians come, she always uses it. Well, when there are, I mean, I think, well I think it really con I mean, when I'm with the Dutch I really thought the other day I can  till David comes back again, quite quickly. Well I hear you, but . Mm. I forget it, erm, where is it . stop there for tonight, but I had  you know, I just spoke French. I just didn't open my mouth, but I understood what they said and they didn't know . You know, and so, so the second time, the second day I could say one or two words and the third a little bit more, but eh that's it. Same when I'm, when I'm in Italy, I, I can't speak Italian very well, but when I'm there a week, I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar isn't perfect, I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me,. Yes. Yes. I, that, for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish. Yeah. Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins, you really ca can in my, you know in your   Yes. Your sub conscience, yeah. You'll pick it up. Mm, mm. And I really understand Italian quite well, and eh, when I had Spanish, I, I suppose . You picked it up.. All the time I had, I had  Spanish. Did you? And when I had to speak, I spoke Italian. Did you? Well I didn't know Spanish, but I got by with the Italian, you know, I had, I had once,. don't you? Yeah, yeah. And eh, Julia and  and eh Ruth and her husband , eh went to Madrid and I stayed with Isobel. Mm, mm. , and we went to the beach and I came back and  , leap of the whole er, side of the car. You can imagine so, I , it's awful. So Yeah. I , want other people's cars in . That's very funny, for example, I went Dutch because when we were small my brother run away. Yeah. He always, well we not always  often, very often, spoke Dutch with each other. Did you? Yes, because of, we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends, so we  then, and we mostly spoke Dutch and now, since I, so it's nearly, since now seven years have been, since I have gone to States, first year in eighty three, came back in eighty four, and since then we've never, ever spoke Dutch. Erm, yes, yeah yes. Yes I see now, ah, yeah . We always speak French to each other. Yeah,. That a make . if you spoke Dutch all the time. Oh. So Yes, with my mother and my father . All French,, yeah. when we couldn't, when, when we were not allowed to in the States. Really, I think it  But now it I remember a  on the telephone, you know, I used to speak and talk and talk, apparently she would switch to German, so that means that I can't  someone   Shouldn't allow it, I, I always knew what it meant . And, that, you make me think of it, suddenly she'd switched. For what happened she can do it because, so okay, let's hope it's going to be nice. I really pleased with, with that . Really, I really like it. Sweet, isn't it? It's very nice with the plants on. Yes, yes. Very, very nice. Now I'm, I'm really thinking all the time , something in the back thing  The grass, the garden  . Looks nice, and erm, how do you call these erm, ah . Looks nice. Yes. It's, it's already once cove covered the whole wall, but when we took the other fence down, the high fence eh, you know, they damaged everything.

I see, have you got,apartment? of the house. You know, I mean Definitely see the wall from the house  That's this, yes see the wall of the house, but that's . And that'll come down , will come down and you will have balconies . Another wall , no, no, no, no balconies . How do you know? Another wall, that's what . No balconies. Another lounge . Can image if we had all these people, and  I don't know , I don't, I hope that, no I don't . Well Isobel said they can't or not  No they can't. And they're not going very far inwards . That'll means they do go . That they do have . it's a supposedly two down , large building whether, cos they can't really move inwards   They have to oh, they have to really watch because  They're very strict. Yes, but do you know, in Gabby's in , they had to, to, the builders just gave what they want , and all your residents , they took them to court and they had , eh But was it too late? Fans, yes, no,, building, you know,, and then the, they made trouble again and then for every down they didn't pull something down and so they had to pay oh so many er thousands . Really? But, they had a lot of trouble as the builders took  what they like, so, we've got to watch these, this building. When are we going to do that? I don't know, but there has just been bought. Just been bought? think so. Oh, now we have to really look. It would look dreadful if each . Mm  When, when can you hear about it? Yesterday  And the house  sold when?

I had to wait for about ten minutes. Did you? Socks You are tired. Why don't you lie down a bit? Well I'm doing much better now. Are you? Yeah but just soft strokes. Did you did you sleep well? Yup. You did? Hmm hmm. Yeah. with you round. You know he did You know what really put everything in the jacket. Nearly put so I wasn't nervous. Did he come at once? No. You know sometimes Yeah but I you know no  It comes it comes by bits and bits with me. Yeah  All the time it's always like that and I hate that because I'm that's why I'm so slow too. You know you have people who write it once you know once through. I can't do that. Yeah. Yeah. Impossible. I've never been able to do that. Yeah. So I write like ten lines or something yeah Then poof. I have to wait and see how I'm going to to do further. What you know. Yeah. Because I have to structure while I'm writing I you know so I'm structuring while and I can't write  as well. You only structure? I think that's a good idea er to structure before you plan make a plan before you start. Yeah But I somehow I don't do it and I know I'm sure it is Yeah It is better. No I Well I planned a little bit but even if I plan I still can't write it. Yeah yeah yeah and you know what until I get started takes long for me and then I usually can get going you know but until I keep going or sometimes somebody  and I say that's it! And then after one page or half. My God! I don't know anything anymore Yes that's it you know what I mean? That's it. And then  I have to start something else. Yeah Does that happen to you? Yeah. My third question today yes? I was I didn't know which question to take Yes that's it yes One or the other, Hmm hmm which one should I take? So I decided at least I stood there for ten minutes which one should I take? Wondering which  You know? Which is the most stupid thing. Well no. It's just And then I started one  and I said no no no I won't be able to do this. And I started another one and I said no I won't be able to this and got back to the other one and did the other one.. And I remember once we had that was we had accountancy  and we have a year to pick that one. We had to have solved so much problems and I just this way and I just wouldn't have it you know it's just impossible it's impossible and I hummed and hawed which way and hummed and hawed which way. In the end it must have been the right one because I was the best of all and I you know until five minutes before everything finished I just couldn't make up my mind Hmm hmm So er I was just lucky yeah To to have taken the right decision for once. Uh huh But as it is as you say you know it took five minutes before it all happened in  I find this very  don't you? Or you know you know how to continue? . Tomorrow it's easier isn't it? Didn't you say so? Yes Much? Hmm. Not much those two here now this week other house. But next week this You've Well I have much it was much easier for me to study the once. Yes. I have next week Ah huh. Yes. Just two next week. Also I've asked you I'm sure many times but Also the one next Also Wednesday and Thursday? Yeah. Yeah. So that's that will come easier to you really? Yeah. This one was hard because this one to me I think was the hardest because it was was theoretical Yeah yeah and we had to have theory that much you know  Yes yes  And tomorrow it's hard because it's an economics one and I have never had economics before so but it's the second part in Zurich because it's flying economics  telecommunications and political television  Ah huh that's all practical? Much more practical so that's all right  yes and then  next week it's it's easier easier subjects. Ah huh. So  Well  it's a good thing there're only four aren't there? Mmm mm. There are. Well afterwards is your thesis going to be difficult? No. Not really. You know it's the thing you wanted. You choose and so you like to Yeah. Okay. You know the reason to choose? Yes I have interviews and then just need to start well I need some moral interviews and then start. Structuring Yes Finding more readings Yes You know and then writing.

DEM DEM-KE2-132 43.42 "Yes, erm  on the other hand there are some  there are some very good comprehensive schools! Oh yes! I mean you can't, you can't erm Thank you. Thank you love. There's some very bad grammar schools! Yeah, I agree with you. You know, again as you said earlier on it all comes down in the end to the head! You see we've had some very good reports , I mean that went through a very bad patch but they've this new Doctor Colin   he's meant to be pretty switched on Mm. and erm they say, you know it's it's  turning into a very good school! So that's one possibility to look at. But  I mean a a grammar doesn't suit every child does it? Some kids  erm er , you know. No it doesn't, you see. I mean I yo , I would always say, you know if a child was borderline Mm. If there was a doubt then he would be better not going to a grammar school Mm. because he would be at the top end of the other school  That's right! That is exactly that! and then success breeds success! That's right! That's right. Erm  whereas  Right. er the same child goes to the grammar school, he's in the C stream, he's at bottom  Yeah. at the end and they perhaps don't bother quite so much  and Yeah. he, he drops back, he gets  Yeah. further and further and further behind. Yeah. Now I found that, you see, cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls, which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I  and there was only me that passed and I, I didn't wanna do it. So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream  right the way through  and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on. And I never regretted not going. No. That's right. You know a lot of people said to me oh how stupid! To my mum, you know  she's passed, you're daft, but  there'd have been so much hassle for me to get there! Yeah. And I didn't feel confident, and I wasn't happy within  Yeah. myself and my mum said if you're not, then you don't  That's right! wanna go. That's right! And that's how I felt about  Yeah. it, I didn't  and I felt I'd have no friends around where I lived and  you know, I'd always be alienated, I'd always be home later  and I said to my mum I don't think I can cope with it, so she said right then you don't go! And I didn't. And I never regretted it, I'll be quite honest with you. And I think lots of children probably feel that way. Yeah. And  That's right! you know. But it's  Ha! nice talking to someone about education cos I talk to some people and they think I'm crackers cos I took my kid out of a state school! You know? Ya, I I, I'm only sorry that you felt you  Yeah that  had to! And I'm sorry  I am! the fact that you had to! I am! Erm but I, you know I think that's  that, that's an indictment of it you see because I  Oh it's cost us an arm and a leg! It really has! Yeah sure! An and it's  what makes me so cross as I walk past that blinking school every day and you think my kid should be over there! That's it! That's just  the way I feel   Yeah I know it's sad isn't it? Do you know what I mean? Yeah I do. I do know what you  Yeah. mean and I think it's, it's, it's a shame! It's awful really! when I speak about it I get so upset that they've got three or four and they can't ! And that's right! You see. You can't! And there, lots of people and and lots of them actually they came from Abbotsbury and  that all their kids were doing so well and then this period of a year, nothing! No progress! No ! I know! Well You know! Nice to talk to you  See you again. again. Bye bye! Bye bye!"
FIC FIC-AC2-006 8.65 "Mark Sanders returned from Istanbul feeling exhausted, depressed and ill. The blinding headaches he had been experiencing in recent weeks were taking their toll, and he looked grey and drawn when he arrived home. Lately, Georgina had been worried by the general deterioration in his appearance. But now she was visibly shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed her. She wanted to say, ‘You look awful, darling,’ but decided against it. ‘What kind of a trip have you had?’ she asked instead. ‘Oh, not too bad,’ he replied wearily. She took his suitcase and placed it at the bottom of the stairs. ‘Come into the kitchen, and we will have a cup of tea. I've so much news to tell you. All sorts of things seem to have happened while you have been away this time.’ Mark smiled thinly and kissed her affectionately on the cheek. ‘Tell me about it,’ he replied. ‘I could do with a good laugh.’ ‘Why darling? What's the matter? Trouble at t'mill?’ Mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen. ‘Perhaps it's old Montezuma's revenge,’ he replied. ‘Must be getting too old for this globe-trotting lark, or else my mis-spent youth is catching up on me. I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is a young man's game.’ ‘Nonsense, Mark. You're still a young man…well, youngish.’ she said, trying to tease him out of his apparent lethargy and depression. ‘Let's have that cup of tea and you'll feel better.’ ‘Ah, fill the cup, what boots it to repeat, how time is slipping underneath our feet,’ he quoted with a sigh. ‘Oh darling. What a sad sack we are today. Is that how you feel? Shall I accompany you on the violin? Now let me tell you all the news.’ She poured the tea. ‘Christopher has been promoted after only one year. The Chairman of the company told him he was most impressed with the contribution he's made to the business, and that he could go right to the top if he keeps it up. I knew you'd be delighted to hear that.’ She sipped her tea. ‘Next… I've found a super husband for Harriet. Champion of the breed at Crufts last year. Lives in the next village, believe it or not. Absolutely magnificent dog.’ ‘Lucky Harriet,’ said Mark. ‘What else? Ah yes; a Secretary at the Ministry of Industry wants you to ring him. Seems they want you to address the European Commission on European industrial development. In Dublin, I think she said. Something about the factors which influence multi-nat location decisions. Anyway, you'll know what it means when you see it. I've written it all down. Oh and yes…a chap from Conservative Central Office rang up to say they'd like to know if you would be prepared to stand for the European Parliament. He sounded somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan. I said I didn't think so, as you were rather busy, but I'd pass the message on. Hope I did the right thing. I said you never knew where you were from one week to the next. He said that would do nicely. Just like the American Express advertisement. Perfect credentials apparently, for European parliamentarians. ‘Now what next? The Chicheley-Smythes have bought an absolutely super villa in Sardinia and say we could rent it if we'd like to. I've seen the photographs. Gorgeous location overlooking a quiet bay. It sleeps ten with a permanent staff of three. Only a thousand pounds a week, yacht included. I'd love that for two or three weeks, wouldn't you?’ ‘We wouldn't want to stint ourselves,’ Mark said facetiously, ‘four or five, I should think….’ ‘And we could take the family,’ she said. ‘We haven't had a family holiday for years. I'd like that. But we can talk about that later. And I've decided to take up riding again. Don't ask me why. Just got the urge, that's all.’ She gave him a beautiful smile, which lit her lovely face. ‘Well, how's that for starters?’ she asked. He had heard that expression before. ‘Is there more?, ‘Now let me see. Ah, yes… Andrew's coming home for the weekend so I thought it would be nice to have a drinks party. I've invited the Bunkers, if that's all right. I like Clem and Gwen and the girls would be nicer company for Andrew.’ ‘Fine,’ agreed Mark without much enthusiasm. ‘If Clem can make it, that is. I heard about this latest Merseyside strike in Istanbul. Could finish off the UK vehicle division,’ he said forlornly, ‘and Don Peters,’he added, shaking his head. Some of the stupid bastards won't be satisfied until we no longer make a single vehicle in the UK. Then I suppose they'll say it's all management's fault, and people will believe them. And who the hell IS management?’ he demanded, his voice rising. ‘People like me, who've worked their guts out to expand the business while the militant bastards have been working their guts out to destroy it.’ Georgina was nodding agreement. She patted his wrist. ‘I'm quite sure you're right, dear. But we weren't talking about the motor industry and the never-ending management-union saga. We were talking about Andrew coming home for the weekend and having the Bunkers round for drinks. And I do wish you wouldn't swear like that when you talk about business. You never used to swear, you know. At least, you didn't when you were with me. But you do now, darling, and I do wish you wouldn't. You are becoming so hard and bitter and it's not really like you.’ Mark sighed. ‘I'm sorry. It's just….’ ‘It's just that there really is trouble at t'mill,’ she said quietly. ‘That's it, isn't it? You weren't going to tell me. You were just going to worry about it alone. You let me go rabitting on…. He hugged her; kissed her cheek. ‘I'm not sure yet that there really is something to worry about.’ ‘But you think there is.’ He nodded. ‘I have a horrible feeling that UM is about to reorganise  world-wide planning operations and, if that happens, it's curtains for the European organisation and for me.’ ‘Curtains?’ she said. ‘What exactly would that mean?’ ‘Early retirement.’ ‘Mark, you're not serious!, ‘I think it could be on the cards. They could transfer me to Detroit, or somewhere. I don't know, but I don't like the signs.’ ‘Oh, Mark,’ she said. ‘They wouldn't do that to you. They just couldn't. Not after all you've done for the Corporation. They couldn't be that unfair and ruthless.’ His expression was wry. ‘My dear, they'll do whatever they feel is necessary to do. Sentiment, loyalty, service and track record, none of these things will come into it.’ Georgina took him in her arms and kissed him on the lips. ‘It's all so ridiculous that we're not going to even think about it any more,’ she said firmly, hiding her fears. ‘Now come into the garden,’ she added, smiling. ‘I want to show you the clematis. It's a mass of colour.’ Lying in bed that evening, they talked a lot about their life together. They recalled their first days. The county ball. The Paul Jones and the emotional somersaults when the music stopped and they came face to face for the very first time. The wedding. The birth of their first son, Adam, and then Christopher and Andrew. The children growing up with all the laughter and tears. Schooldays and the void they both felt when the boys went off to boarding school, followed by the joy unconfined when they came home at the end of term. Mark's promotions and progress up the company ladder. New and changing homes. Friends lost and friends gained. Family achievements and disappointments. Notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly, it had all been wonderful. They fell asleep in the early hours of the morning, holding hands. The next day Mark arrived back at UM's European headquarters in London and received an early call from Muldoon. He went down the airless corridor to his Boss's office, said hello to the secretary, and walked into the large oak-panelled room which was as big as the lobby of many a sizeable hotel. Muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him, coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched. ‘Hello Mark. Have a good trip?’ He took the Englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table. Instinctively, Mark felt uneasy. Why the hand on the arm and the over-friendly approach? Muldoon never emerged from behind his desk to greet colleagues. Only visitors and VIPs got that special reception. Muldoon poured the coffee. ‘How did the Planning meeting go?’ Mark asked him. ‘What was Nate's reaction? Did he and the Committee go along with my proposals?’ he added. ‘It went fine,’ Muldoon said. He seemed somewhat uneasy. ‘Klepner did a good job.’ ‘How did he handle the questions?’ Mark asked. ‘He doesn't have the inside knowledge to deal with questions.’ ‘Oh, OK really. I handled some and so did Mueller. But Klepner did OK. He didn't let the side down.’ Mark nodded. ‘What was Mueller doing answering questions. He was there to ASK them. He doesn't know the inside track any more than Klepner.’ ‘Maybe not, but he soon will,’ Muldoon replied quietly. ‘And what does that mean?’ Muldoon seemed to be taking a long time over his coffee. He evaded Mark's eyes. ‘He's goin' to head-up world planning operations from Detroit.’ ‘He's already co-ordinating the regional plans to provide a world picture. So what's changed?’ Deep down he knew. ‘He's not going to just co-ordinate and consolidate any longer,’ Muldoon said, with increasing nervousness. ‘He's gonna  plan, direct and control worldwide planning operations from Detroit, including the regional planning functions.’ Mark's expression was one of faked incredulity. His gut feelings had been right. ‘You've got to be joking!’ he scoffed. ‘I know that's what Mueller's always wanted, but Nate and the Executive Committee would never fall for that bloody empire-building game! The regions are far too big and complex to be handled from Detroit and even if they were foolish enough to believe that they could do it more effectively — which they can't — they would be crazy to try.’ ‘I know, Mark, I know,’ Muldoon said. ‘But that's what they're gonna do.’ ‘It will boomerang,’ the Englishman said heatedly. ‘Overseas Governments and local nationals just won't stand for it, particularly when they get to know what's going on. That's one corporate plan that can't win, not in the long term. ‘I know, Mark. But they think they can run everything from Detroit and that's the way the organisation is going to be restructured. They are working on it right now. We will know the details in a few weeks’ time. Couple of months at the latest.’ Mark said quietly: ‘And how does that affect the European organisation? ‘The organisation will be wound up. I'm taking early retirement.’ ‘And me?’ Muldoon shrugged. ‘Not certain yet. But my guess is early retirement too, unless you're prepared to go back to divisional work. Local MD perhaps?’ The Englishman snorted. ‘You know I can't go back. Who the hell can? In any case, you know as well as I do that the MDs are always American.’ ‘Well, there won't be any European job functions, that's for sure,’ Muldoon said. ‘There'll be a direct link between Detroit and the line managers in each country, with Detroit calling the shots.’ ‘Don't they realise they're playing with political dynamite? Mark demanded. ‘Mueller won't give a damn about the effect of a corporate plan on Europe and on individual countries. If he wants to import vehicles or components from Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong into Europe, he'll go ahead and do it, regardless of the economic consequences for the European countries concerned. The only thing you can be sure of is that US interest will always come first. Oh, and there's one more thing you can be sure of,’ he added sourly. ‘They won't plan to supply the US market from imports. You can bet your bottom dollar on that! Jesus wept!’ he continued, hackles rising. ‘Mueller will have the power to make or break whole areas of Europe. He's the last guy in the world who should be given such power. The bloody man's power drunk already.’ He was angry and bitter. ‘I know,’ Muldoon agreed sadly. ‘Then what are you and Clancy doing about it?’ ‘Look, Mark,’ Muldoon said forlornly ‘What's the point? The wheels have already been set in motion. We're not gonna change anyone's mind. You know that.’ His tone was abject. ‘Sorry you're takin' it so bad,’ he added miserably. ‘How else should I take it?’ Mark demanded. ‘It's my life which is about to go down the plughole. I'm not an American on a brief overseas assignment. I've spent my entire working life in the European components’ business. I've grown up in it. It's in my blood. I've built plants and managed them. Designed products and marketed and sold them. When I was an apprentice there were two component plants in Europe, and now there are seventeen, and I've had a hand in establishing the last twelve. What the hell do you expect me to say? Oh, is that what they are proposing to do? Well bully for Mueller and the Corporation? I'll go and collect my hat and coat!’ ‘I know how you feel, Mark,’ Muldoon said sadly. ‘Do you, Pat? Do you? You're sixty-one and have been looking forward to retirement. I'm fifty and have a long way to go. I don't think you can see things the way I see them. ‘Well, perhaps not,’ Muldoon agreed. ‘But I can understand how you feel.’ The Englishman nodded and poured himself more coffee. ‘So what's going to happen to the European Plan?’ he asked. ‘Mueller will drive it from Detroit, with one or two amendments agreed at the EPC meeting,’ Muldoon told him. ‘What amendments?’ ‘No further plant investment in the UK.’ ‘I suppose Mueller saw to that,’ Mark said sarcastically. ‘He really hates our guts! God help the British plants under the new regime!’ Muldoon shook his head. ‘No, it wasn't that. It was the strike at Merseyside. That was the last straw as far as Nate was concerned. Up until that news hit the Committee, Don had won the day with his UK Vehicle Division proposals. But as soon as Nate heard about the latest strike, that was it. End of story. He instructed Mueller to phase-out vehicle manufacture in the UK.’ Mark nodded. ‘How did Don take it? He was beginning to win through.’ ‘He's very upset. Naturally. It's the first time in his career he hasn't come out on top. Mueller is taking over the plan, and Don is being transferred back to the States. Public relations job or something similar. Just think of it, a man of his talent and ability stooging around the media.’ ‘So when's he going back to the States?’ Mark said. ‘It won't be announced for a week or so, but he's already been told. He'll fly out inside the month.’ ‘And what do you and I do now? Mark enquired. ‘Start emptying the files?’ Muldoon made a face. ‘Afraid so. Klepner will take over the files and ship them back to the States. He'll be Mueller's European components’ Planning Manager in Detroit.’ ‘Klepner?’ Mark uttered in mock astonishment. ‘The man knows nothing about Europe. He's a novice. A bloody charlatan!’ ‘I know it sounds crazy, Mark,’ Muldoon said. ‘But there it is. We have no choice in the matter. I was instructed to tell you, and I have. New York and Detroit will come up with an attractive separation package, you can be sure of that. They've already told me you'll get the maximum terms permitted under British law. The Corporation wants to do the right thing by you.’ The two men rose from the table together. ‘Sure. We have no choice in the matter,’ said the Englishman. ‘There has to be losers as well as winners,, said the American. ‘I guess we're both losers, Mark.’ The Englishman returned to his own palatial office and sat with his head in hands. Another of his blinding headaches had developed and he felt a tight sensation in his chest, which made breathing very painful and difficult. His secretary entered the room. Can I get you a coffee, Mr Sanders? You don't look at all well. Shall I get the doctor?’ He looked up and smiled. ‘No thank you Millie. I'm all right. Just a headache. Be OK in a minute. Would love a cup of coffee though. ‘Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor?’ she asked. ‘No thank you. I'll be OK. It's only a headache.’ Millie had her reasons for being concerned. The petticoat Mafia at the top of the organisation always knew what was going on, often before the top executives themselves. Millie and the secretaries of Pat Muldoon and Clancy McGillicuddy were all close friends. They had got together over the weekend to discuss the implications of the confidential letter the two Americans had received from Randy Mueller on behalf of Nate Cocello. Major changes were afoot which affected their respective bosses. By the time Mark reached home that evening, the pains in his head were excruciating. He decided against telling Georgina about his meeting with Muldoon. He would wait for the right moment. This wasn't it."
FIC FIC-CFY-001 8.31 "1937 Joe and Harry stood on the platform side by side. There was now no difference in their height although Harry was twenty-one and Joe sixteen. Even in physique they were very much alike, both being thick in the shoulders and almost of the same colouring, except that Joe's hair showed a black sheen whereas Harry's was a dark brown, thick matt. It was only when you looked at their faces that you saw the difference in both age and expression: Harry's face was round, his eyes merry, while Joe's features inclined to length and his grey eyes, which at times seemed colourless, had in their depths a touch of melancholy that had deepened with the years. Joe started when Harry's elbow caught him in the ribs as he said, ‘I wonder if my illustrious brother will be as insufferable as he was during the Christmas holidays?’ ‘Martin's never insufferable.’ ‘Of course he is. All those fellows who get to Oxford become insufferable… It used to be ‘I'm doing my law moderations’— he pursed his lips and wagged his head —‘but these last couple of years it's been, ‘I'm reading for my finals’. Gosh! how sick-making.’ ‘You're only envious, and you know you were the most concerned when he had to lose almost  a year to that fever. Anyway, you know you love him.’ Harry had been about to make a jovial retort, as was his nature, but he stopped and, screwing up his face, he said, ‘Joe, the things you come out with. You don't say you love people.’ ‘Why not, when you do?’ ‘Well, just because…’ ‘That's what Mick once said to me.’ ‘Mick?’ ‘Yes, years ago he told me you don't say you love people. Yet when you don't love many people I think you should tell those whom you do.’ ‘Oh, lad.’ Harry stepped back from Joe now, but poked his head forward as, under his breath, he asked, ‘You don't come out with things like that at school, do you?’ ‘No.’ ‘It's a damn good job you don't, laddie, or I could see you being hauled up before the old man.’ Harry now looked at his watch, saying, ‘It's nearly fifteen minutes late; I bet it's got diverted to London.’ He grinned. ‘Must be marvellous up there today.’ He looked upwards now at the bunting stretched across the girders of the platform, then said, ‘With a little imagination you know I could dismiss the Coronation and take it that this show of affection was all for my being twenty-one today. I'm twenty-one today, I'm twenty-one today.’ He began to whistle now, accompanying it with a little shuffle of his feet which brought a wide grin from Joe; then becoming serious for a moment, he said, ‘You knew, I do appreciate Martin getting leave to come home for my twenty-first. He could easily have  gone into London and enjoyed the jollifications. But there'll be some jollification around the old homestead tonight and nobody likes tripping the light fantastic better than wor Martin.’ He had dropped into a thick Geordie twang and, after laughing, he looked up and down the platform now, saying, ‘We must be the only ones expecting a passenger.’ ‘They'll all be glued to their wireless sets, I suppose.’ ‘Yes, that's it.’ ‘They say he's going to speak tonight, the King. Amazing, isn't it? Amazing.’ He moved his head slowly from side to side. ‘Oh, here it comes at last.’ Harry again looked at his watch. ‘Almost twenty minutes late. I'm going to report this.’ The train puffed to a stop; only five passengers alighted, and the only male among them a tall young man, his hair so fair that from a distance it appeared almost white, waved to them before turning back to the carriage and lifting out a case. Now they were all together, clapping each other on the arm, shaking hands, laughing; then Martin, gripping his brother by the shoulders, said, ‘Happy days ahead, laddie.’ ‘Thanks, Martin. Thanks.’ Harry's answer was low, even serious sounding. They turned and made their way along the platform, through the small waiting-room and so into the road to where the horse and trap waited. It was Martin who took the reins and as he cried, ‘Gee-up! you there, you flibbertigibbet!’ the horse, as if recognising the voice, tossed its head and went off at a spanking pace down the road, and as they laughed, Harry said, ‘Would you believe it! He never goes like that for me.’ ‘Well, he knows you prefer stinking machines. By the way, how do you like it?’ ‘Like what?’ Martin tugged on the reins for a moment, then turned and looked at his brother, saying, ‘It hasn't arrived?’ ‘If I knew what had to arrive I would tell you.’ ‘Good God! I'll murder them; they promised.’ ‘Promised what?’ ‘Your birthday present, thickhead.’ ‘Oh, don't tell me it's a horse.’ ‘It's your kind of horse.’ Harry's eyes and mouth stretched: then he was leaning over Joe and gripping Martin's shoulder, saying, ‘You haven't…it isn't?’ ‘I have and it is, and I'm mad, because I hate your damned machines.’ ‘Aw! Martin. What is it?’ ‘It's what you're always on about.’ ‘An AJS!’ Harry turned quickly to Joe and cried excitedly, ‘Did you ever know such a brother as mine, spending his money on something he hates!’ Joe smiled but didn't answer, and Harry, again in a thoughtful tone, said, ‘What would you like when you're twenty-one, Joe?’ But before he could answer, Martin, turning his head to the side, called over his shoulder, ‘Why need you ask! A set of encyclopedias, of course. How's the writing going, Joe?’ ‘Not so good.’ ‘What! And you aiming to come up and read English Lit.’ ‘That's the point,’ Joe called back now, ‘I have to do so much reading I've hardly any time for writing, at least not the kind I want to do.’ ‘Poetry?’ There was a scornful note in Martin's voice and Joe answered, ‘Well, no, not just poetry; in fact, not poetry at all.’ ‘No? Don't tell me you've gone in for politics. There's been enough trouble without you starting. Or are you aiming to take Kipling's place?’ Quickly switching the conversation, he addressed the next remark to Harry, saying, ‘I wonder how the Duke is feeling today; I wonder if he still thinks the exchange was worth it.’ ‘I'm sure he does. He loved her; he must have.’ The brothers turned and looked at Joe and presently Martin said on a laugh, ‘That's what he's going to be, Harry, a romantic novelist. You can tell, can't you? In fact, it's a pity he isn't in the game now. Look at the material he could have had this past year. Besides the Duke's romance, there was Princess Juliana marrying a German prince; and then there's our bleached beauty, Miss Jean Harlow. By! there'll never again be a year like this for you to get your teeth into.’ ‘Shut up!’ Martin and Harry laughed together and Harry thumped Joe in the shoulder, saying, ‘Take no notice, lad; you'll get there. I only wish I had half your grey matter.’ For the rest of the journey Joe listened to the brothers talking about their futures, particularly that of Martin after he came down in June. As for Harry, his aim was engineering and he was now in his third year at the College of Science in Newcastle. It was as they approached the gates that Joe pointed away to the left and towards the hills where a man was walking and he cried excitedly, ‘There's Mick!’ ‘Mick? Mick Smith?’ Martin screwed up his eyes and looked towards the hills, saying, ‘How can you tell from here?’ ‘Oh, I know his walk.’ ‘Is he back home for good?’ ‘No’— Joe shook his head —‘he's taking a holiday; he's twenty-one an' all, you know; well, he was last month.’ ‘Is he still working in the factory?’ ‘Yes, he was promoted, he's head of his department now.’ ‘Well, that's not surprising, he was always a wizard with wireless.’ ‘Yes, he was. He is.’ Joe continued to look over his shoulder to where the figure in the distance had become a mere speck. When they came in sight of the house it was to see Ellen Jebeau standing on the terrace, and when Martin drew the horse to a standstill at the foot of the steps she was there to meet them. Holding out her hand, her smile wide, she said, ‘It's good to see you home again, Martin,’ and his answer was to take her hand and kiss her on the cheek and say, ‘It's good to be home, Aunt. How are you?’ ‘Very well. Very well…and what do you think about the new man?’ She extended a hand towards Harry, and Martin said derisively, ‘New man! He'll  never be a man, he's still in the nursery playing with toy bikes.’ Again the two brothers were pushing at each other and as they all mounted the steps Ellen stepped and walked by the side of her son, something she was in the habit of doing whenever they were in company, and which Joe had been aware of from the time she had recovered after his uncle's death. He hadn't known whether to put it down to the fact that she imagined he was being left outside the camaraderie of the brothers or that in some strange way she was laying claim on him. Her action always embarrassed him, but as it was unobtrusive he doubted if anyone else noticed it. In the hall, turning to Martin, she said, ‘Come and see the table before you go upstairs,’ and hurried forward to the dining-room, where Martin exclaimed in genuine appreciation of the table, beautifully decorated with flowers, glass, and silver and set for sixteen people. ‘It's wonderful, Aunt! Beautiful. Better than I had on my twenty-first.’ He turned a comically aggressive face towards Harry, saying, ‘Mine was never like this.’ ‘'TWAS; it was even better. You had two tables, the second one to accommodate your lady friends; I don't have so many.’ ‘Well, that's your fault, isn't it? You've got to acquire charm and have a presence.’ He walked around the table now in an exaggerated pose, and Harry, laughing, said, ‘If it wasn't for spoiling Aunt Ellen's work I would throw that centrepiece at you.’ ‘Anyway, who's coming?’ Martin was addressing Ellen, and she, looking at Harry, said, ‘Well, it was  up to Harry, and he wanted the Doltons…’ ‘Oh yes! We must have the Doltons’— Martin nodded and winked at Harry —‘especially Rachel… What about Betty? Isn't she married yet?’ ‘No; she's not married yet; I think she's waiting for you.’ Harry pulled a face at his brother now as Ellen put in quickly, ‘The Hallidays too and their cousins, two young ladies who are staying with them.’ She turned towards Harry now, saying, ‘The Crosbie sisters?’ When Harry nodded Martin said, ‘How old are they?’ ‘Nell is nineteen and Marion eighteen,’ Harry said and, poking his head forward with emphasis, he added, ‘And neither of them is a beauty.’ ‘Oh!’ Martin craned his head up out of his collar. ‘Well, that cuts them out of my book, unless, of course, they're entertaining, witty, rich, and —’ Here he turned and began to march from the room, saying, ‘have the sense to appreciate my worth.’ They all laughed. Even Ellen laughed and, looking at Harry, she said, ‘He doesn't change.’ ‘No, he doesn't.’ Harry now stood looking along the table as he added thoughtfully, ‘It would be awful if he did, wouldn't it?’ Ellen paused for just a fraction of a second before she answered, ‘Yes; yes, I suppose it would.’ Joe looked at his mother and there came into his mind a thought that wasn't new: his mother didn't like Martin; she liked Harry but not Martin; and Martin didn't like her. It was two o'clock in the afternoon. the sky was high, the air so clear that he imagined he could see to the  ends of the earth. He was sitting with Mick at the top of a hill and he was wishing with a deep desire that he could remain in time, this present time, forever. Somehow he always had this feeling when he was with Mick. Mick made him feel rested: his brain didn't churn and ask questions when he was with Mick. Mostly he listened; not that Mick talked a lot, but when he did everything he said seemed to have meaning. Now, as the thought came into his mind he spoke it aloud, and had he spoken like this to anyone else it would have been taken as an insult, for what he said was, ‘It's a pity you haven't had education, Mick.’ And Mick, looking straight ahead, was silent for a moment, then said, ‘Yes, I've often thought that, Joe, but not so much of late. Years ago when I used to see the young masters going off to their boarding schools…you too, I used to envy you all. But not any more, because you see this is how I look at it now: those kind of schools grind you into a certain way of thinking and…and somehow, unless you become very careful, you're stuck that way for the rest of your life. You've been set in a certain class and no matter how your opinions change and you want to throw that class off, if ever a man does, it won't let him, it's there in his voice, in his manner; even if a gentleman was to take to the road he'd still be a gentleman; I mean, according to the kind of education he's received, so to my mind that has become a kind of cage. Do you follow me?’ They looked at each other, then returning their gaze to the far distance there was a silence between them before Mick went on again, ‘As I see it now, real education is what you get from life: not what  life gives you, but what you give to it. I read a lot, Joe, and it appears to me that every man, even every thinking man has always had a different view of the same subject; the more I read of men and their lives and their ideas the more I realise there's no black and white in the world; there's good points to be found even in the blackest, and there's some very dark streaks in the so-called saints. As for heaven and hell, well, Joe, as I see it we make them both ourselves.’ ‘You don't believe in God then, Mick?’ ‘Yes and no, Joe. I don't believe in the God the parson used to present to us three times on a Sunday.’ He laughed now. ‘Eeh! his idea did put the fear of God into me. You know, Joe’— he leant towards him now, a wide grin spreading over his face —‘I used to wet me pants every Sunday morning. It's true.’ As Joe bowed his head and laughed, Mick went on, ‘And every Sunday night for years and years it happened, because every Sunday night I'd go down to hell. You know where it was, Joe?’ How he was laughing at himself and he could hardly get the words out. ‘You know old Farmer Bolton's place before it was burned down, you know, where the pig-sties were and the stink? Well’— he choked now with laughter —‘I would go in among those pigs and they would all start scratching a hole and there I would be standing on a clapboard looking down and nearly sick with the smell. And when it was so deep I couldn't see the bottom, Old Bolton's prize sow, you know the one who had borne so many litters, there was no space atween her belly and the ground. Well, I used to wait for her, trembling like a leaf; then she would come behind me and bump me, and down I would go, down, down, down, into hell and wake up screaming and our Charlie shaking the life out of me…’ Now both of them were choking with their laughter as Mick ended, ‘It got so bad that they used to wait for it every Sunday night and try to smother me with a pillow. It's a wonder I survived.’ ‘Oh, Mick! Mick!’ Joe was rocking himself now, the tears running down his face. Then he set Mick off into another spasm of laughter when he asked, ‘Do you think I could get a job alongside you in the factory?’ Some time later, Joe, looking at his wrist watch, said on a note of deep regret, ‘I'll have to be getting back, the guests are coming at four. How long are you staying, Mick? A week?’ ‘No, no; I'm off the morrow.’ ‘So soon? I thought you had a week.’ ‘Yes. Yes, I have, but…but a little goes a long way.’ He nodded back towards the house. ‘The cottage is still crammed and…and I want to do some visiting.’ They stared at each other for a moment before Mick added, ‘You've never seen Carrie for years, have you?’ ‘No; no, I haven't.’ ‘Well, that's where I'm going. I often spend my weekends there; there's always a bed for me. My Uncle Stan and Aunt Alice are very good to me and more than good to Carrie, they've given her a start in life she would never have had here. She's on a secretarial course, you know.’ ‘Really?’ ‘Oh yes; she's a bright lass, is Carrie.’ Joe looked to the side. Funny, Mick had never mentioned Carrie in years. The subject had seemed to be taboo; and he himself had in a way pressed her down into his mind because thoughts of her conjured up a feeling tinged with regret and shame, centred round a scene in the bedroom and the rage of his mother. But here was Mick telling him something, he was talking about a young girl, not a little girl, a young girl who was going to be a secretary. She must be seventeen now; she was some months older than him. ‘Do you ever go out for the day, Joe?’ ‘Oh yes; sometimes to Newcastle.’ ‘With your mother?’ ‘Yes, yes; or Harry.’ ‘Do you think your mother would let you go out with me for a day in Newcastle?’ It was on the point of Joe's tongue to say ‘I doubt it’, but what he said was, ‘I don't see why not.’ ‘Good, good. That's agreed on then. What about tomorrow?’ ‘All right.’ ‘We'll have to walk to the station, unless we get a lift.’ ‘I don't mind that.’ ‘All right, it's fixed, tomorrow then.’ They turned away together and marched over the hills towards the estate. ‘If you want to go into Newcastle, then I'll take you into Newcastle.’ ‘I want to go with Mick, Mother.’ ‘Spend the day with Mick, why?’ ‘Just…just because I… I like being with Mick.’ ‘Really! boy. You're hopeless…well, I forbid you.’ ‘I'm sorry, Mother, I'd rather you said yes, because in any case I'm going.’ ‘Now, now! Don't take that attitude with me, Joe. You're not too big yet to be locked in your room.’ Joe slanted his gaze towards her. ‘I wouldn't try that, Mother. Remember the boys are at home and if I was to go and ask Martin he would immediately say yes.’ ‘How dare you! Go and ask Martin indeed!’ ‘Well, he's the head of the house.’ ‘He may be the head of this house but I am your mother and I'm in charge of you.’ ‘I'll be seventeen in a short while, Mother. I heard the master saying at school there could be a war, so next year I could be a man, couldn't I, and be in the Army? You couldn't stop them taking me.’ ‘What's come over you, boy?’ ‘Don't keep calling me boy, Mother.’ ‘I will keep calling you boy, because that's all you are and I repeat, I forbid you to go into Newcastle with Mick Smith. And I say again, don't you take that tone with me.’ As he stared at her he knew that he had come to a crossroads, that if he gave in to her now he'd have to give into her again and again and again. Although he had defied her before, it had only been in words but now the thought that he had the choice of putting those words into action and so set a new pattern, and in doing so break one of the threads that tied him to her, caused his whole body to tremble and his voice to quiver as he said, ‘Either you give me permission freely to  go with Mick tomorrow or I go down now and put it to Martin.’ The trembling turned to slight fear as he saw her colour rise. For a moment he was swept back into the past to those days when her temper would flare into demoniac rage. ‘Get out of my sight, boy. Get…out…of…my…sight!’ He got out of her sight. He went out of the room, into the corridor and into his room and there he stood with his back to the door, his mouth wide, gasping at the air, still in fright, yet knowing that in some way he had emerged as if out of a deep canyon. Joe sat on the wooden kitchen chair and watched Mrs Alice Carver flitting back and forth from the stove to the table, talking all the while. She had what was termed a comfortable figure, but her face was thin, her nose sharp and her voice seemed to take its pattern from her features, just as Mick had described her on the way here; although his Aunt Alice was sharp of nose and of tongue, she was broad in the shoulders and warm in heart, he had said. Flinging a cloth over a side table, she now turned towards Mick and said, ‘I'm not puttin' meself out for you, mind. If I'd known you were coming that would have been different; I mean, bringing company. You always have your meal in the kitchen and I'm not opening the dining-room at such short notice, but you can go and sit in the front room if you want to.’ ‘Who wants to? We're comfortable here.’ ‘Well, it's up to you.’ She was now piling crockery on to the table. ‘Your uncle, as you know, comes in at ten past twelve on the dot and Carrie a few minutes after, that is if she hasn't stopped to gaze in the shops. Well, she knows I put it on the table all at the same time; if it's cold, that's her look out. Would you like a drop of tea while you're waitin'?’ She had now turned abruptly and was addressing Joe, and he, taken by surprise, stammered, ‘Yes…oh no. No, thank you; I can wait for my dinner.’ She now pushed out her chest, drew in her chin, looked at Mick while thumbing towards Joe and said, ‘He expects his dinner! Did you hear that? He expects his dinner!’ Mick looked at Joe, whose face had turned scarlet, and nodded solemnly as he said, ‘Aye, he does, Aunt Alice. It's a bloomin' cheek, isn't it?’ Then they were both laughing, and the little woman, coming up and slapping Joe between the shoulders with such force that he coughed, said, ‘Don't look as if you are bein' confronted by a whale. I'm not gonna swallow you whole, not just now anyway.’ Joe managed to force a smile. Then looking back at Mick who was grinning at him, he bit on his lip and moved his head slightly as if to say, ‘How am I to take her?’ Mick now turned to his aunt and asked, ‘Did Carrie pass her test?’ ‘Of course she did! She could have done it on her head. And I'll tell you something else —’ she paused, went to the oven, took out a tin holding roast potatoes, flicked them over expertly and put the tin back in the oven before she continued, ‘She won't be long in that school, she's a way ahead; and you know what?’ She put her hands on the table and leant towards Mick. ‘He's going to buy her a new typewriter; that old thing she practises on makes a noise like a candyman's trumpet. But she doesn't know, so don't let on. And she's doing shorthand, Pitman's, she calls it. Funny that is, isn't it, to call shorthand Pitman's.’ Joe had gauged that the ‘he’ she referred to was the uncle and the reference to Pitman's shorthand  brought his eyes to Mick and his face ready to go into a grin; but something in Mick's expression checked it and he listened to him saying, ‘She's a bright lass, is Carrie.’ ‘Now you've said it, Mick, you've said it. Yes, our Carrie's a bright lass. And she's going places.’ Joe noticed that the little woman referred to Carrie as if she belonged to them: it was Our Carrie. In his mind's eye there was dawning a picture of this Carrie. He could see the smart business girl: she'd likely be wearing three-inch high heels and her hair would be permed; and not only would she look smart, she'd talk smart. For a moment he wished he hadn't come: he didn't want to see this new Carrie. On the way here this morning, the picture of the Carrie he had once known and played with…and loved, had been plain in his mind; and the nearer he had come to the house where she now lived, he imagined the Carrie he expected to see would be merely an older replica of the one who had run out of his life the day his mother had hit him and knocked him out. That memory too had been brought sharply into focus on this journey. It was as if his mind was digging down through the years and bringing up pictures of past events… Stan Carver was a thick-set, medium-sized man, and strangely, Joe thought, he resembled his wife, at least in features: they had the same sharp-edged face. What was obvious, though, straightaway was that Mr Carver didn't talk much and his greeting of Mick was as to one of the family, indicated with a nod and a ‘Hello, there!’ When Mick introduced him, Mr Carver shook his hand in the conventional way, saying, ‘I'm pleased to  see you, lad. You're welcome,’ then went to the sink in the far corner of the kitchen to wash his hands, came back to the fireside to sit down in a chair to the right of the oven, and watched his wife putting out the meal. It was as she put the last plate on the table that the door opened and Carrie Smith entered the kitchen. Automatically Joe rose to his feet, although Mick remained seated. The girl who was now confronting Joe was someone strange and of whom he held no memory in any corner of his mind. She wasn't smartly dressed as he had imagined: a slack grey coat reached halfway down her calves, her hat was in plain brown felt and from under it her hair hung loose. It was rather unusual, he thought, to see a girl with long hair hanging loose. Her hair was dark brown, as were her eyes; her face was round, her cheeks naturally red. She was wearing no make-up; she could have been a girl fresh from the country. That was until she spoke. When her voice came to his ears it denied the ordinariness of her clothes and the simplicity suggested by her powderless face and loose lying hair, for her tone was crisp, each word clear. Unlike her uncle and aunt, who spoke with the Northern inflection, drawing one word into another, she pronounced the last syllable of each word. This, however, he didn't realise until later when he let himself think about the meeting and how, after the first keen glance, she looked past him as if he weren't there, to greet Mick with ‘Hello. You didn't say you were coming. Why aren't you at work?’ ‘I'm on holiday. The boss knew I was worked to death, and not wanting to lose me said, ‘Mick, you  take a few days rest. if anybody's earned them, you have.’ ‘Oh yes?’ She inclined her head towards her brother. ‘I can quite understand that he would say that.’ She was taking off her hat and coat as she spoke; then going over to her aunt, she bent down and kissed her on the cheek, and followed this with the same salutation for her uncle; and in response he patted her on the shoulder. ‘Haven't you noticed we've got a visitor?’ She had been looking at Mick, but turned slowly and looked at Joe, and smiling slightly said, ‘Yes; yes, of course.’ ‘Well, don't you know who he is?’ When she looked back at Mick she allowed her gaze to rest on him for some seconds before she answered, ‘Of course I know who it is. He hasn't changed much.’ Joe felt a heat seeping up through his body, finally coming to rest in his face, which he knew now had turned scarlet. It was more than five years since she had seen him and she was saying he hadn't changed. He imagined for a moment that he was still in short pants, until she turned to him and added, ‘What I mean is, I would have still recognised you,’ and as if to soften her first statement she added further, ‘Of course, you've grown much taller. You would have, wouldn't you?’ As he stared at her he actually did feel as if he were in short pants, and he couldn't find words to answer her. The situation was saved for him by Mrs Carver's crying, ‘Well, there it is! It's on the table. Take your seats; there's nothing worse than a cold dinner.’ As he moved towards the table Joe noticed that, although they had been bidden to take their seats, neither Mrs Carver, nor Mick, nor Carrie did until Mr Carver was seated; then, each pulling a chair out from under the table, they sat down; and having done so, Mick pointed to a carved chair with a leather seat and said to him, ‘Come, sit down. You're honoured; that's from the parlour; I hope your pants are clean.’ Joe sat down and, shyly taking up his knife and fork, he began to eat; but with some difficulty, for there was no conversation. And he was embarrassed further when he realised he was the last to finish. They waited for him, and when his plate was clean, Mrs Carver, leaning towards him, said, ‘Spotted Dick or rice?’ He blinked and opened his mouth once before he managed, ‘Spotted Dick, please.’ Spotted Dick. That was what Mary called currant pudding, and his mother referred to as boiled fruit suet. He enjoyed his Spotted Dick; but this, too, was eaten in silence. The meal finished, Stan Carver, placing his hands on each side of his plate, slowly raised himself up from the table and, standing still for a moment, said, ‘Thank God for a good dinner.’ And without another word he left the table, went out of the kitchen, presumably through the scullery, and into the backyard; and when the sound of the door shutting came to them, Mick turned with a laugh towards Joe, saying, ‘I bet you're wondering where the first part of grace before meals went.’ Managing a smile, Joe said, ‘Yes; perhaps I am.’ ‘Well, I might tell you that Uncle follows a pattern that was forced upon him. You see, he came from a family of ten lads and four lasses and food was the main object in their lives; and if you weren't careful and hung on to your plate one or the other swiped it.’ He nodded. ‘It's a fact. They did it laughingly, but they did it; so that cut out forever the grace that says, what we are about to receive, so he only gives thanks when he's got it down.’ As they all laughed, Joe glanced towards the little woman, and she, nodding back to him, said, ‘'TIS true.’ Then, looking towards Carrie, she said, ‘Mash the tea, girl. Time's going on; you'll have to be on your way again.’ And with this she went into the scullery, Mick following her. Left alone with Carrie, Joe sat watching her pour the boiling water into the earthenware teapot, and after bringing it to the table and setting it on a stand, she smiled at him and said softly, ‘How are you?’ ‘Very well, thank you. And you?’ His voice was as low as hers had been. ‘Oh, I'm fine, fine.’ It was as if they had just met. ‘I wasn't meaning to be rude when I said you hadn't changed.’ ‘Oh, I know, I know,’ he said and smiled widely. ‘It was just that I was a bit surprised at seeing you. When I've been back home you've always been at school.’ ‘Yes; yes, I would be. I suppose they arranged it like that.’ He bit on his lip; he hadn't meant to say that. What had possessed him? ‘Yes, I suppose they did. Anyway, I don't go very often. Dad comes here but not Mam; she and Aunt Alice never got along.’ ‘Are they sisters?’ ‘Oh no!’ She shook her head; then jerked it backwards, indicating the scullery, as she added in a much lower tone, ‘They're not really my aunt and uncle. We call them that. Mam and Aunt Alice are cousins twice removed, so to speak.’ ‘Oh… Are you happy here?’ ‘Oh yes. Well! what do you think, after that cottage!’ The statement was somehow a reflection on his uncle and now on Martin as his successor… And yet he himself had often thought the cottages should have been extended or pulled down and rebuilt. There was still no indoor sanitation or running water. ‘You prefer living in the town?’ he said. ‘Every time’— she bobbed her head at him ‘especially when you have a room to yourself and a decent job ahead. What was there for anybody, back there?’ She now poked her face towards him, for her words had not been a statement but a direct question, one with a touch of bitterness, and when he didn't answer she went on, ‘It was all right for you. Not that I'm blaming you. Don't you think that. But in your position you had decent surroundings. Decent! What am I talking about? Magnificent surroundings would be a better description. Well, not really magnificent,’ she again contradicted herself, ‘but you know what I mean.’ ‘Yes, yes, I know what you mean, but you know something?’ It was he who was now leaning towards her, and his voice and face serious as he went on, ‘A  big house, a room to yourself, and all the food you can eat isn't everything; you can be as miserable as sin with it all. And anyway, I'm only there for a very small part of the year; I spend most of my time at school, where there's twelve beds to a room…dorm…and one can never be alone, it's not allowed.’ She bowed her head as she apologised, ‘I'm sorry. I do yarp on, and I know you're right.’ They started now as the sound of breaking china came to them, followed by Mrs Carver's voice on a note so high-pitched it was almost a scream, as she cried, ‘Out of me way! Leave them! Leave them! You never come in this kitchen but you break something: when you help it spells disaster. Now go on, get out!’ Mick appeared in the doorway with his hands going through his hair, his head thrust forward and his mouth in an elongated 0, to be greeted by Carrie saying, ‘Eeh! our Mick, not again. What was it this time?’ ‘A dinner plate and cup.’ ‘My goodness! There'll be nothing left shortly.’ ‘I'll get her a new set.’ ‘That isn't the thing; she likes her old china. She'd had it for years until you started helping.’ She now grinned at him as she pushed him, only to cry at him under her breath as he lifted the teapot, ‘Leave it! We don't want that all over the floor.’ As Carrie was pouring out the tea, Mr Carver came back into the room, followed by his wife, and he said to Mick, ‘Stay out of that scullery from now on. D'you hear me?’ ‘Aye, Uncle.’ Mr Carver gulped through his tea, then muttered, ‘Well, I'm away. Are you ready, Carrie?’ ‘Yes, Uncle.’ As Joe watched her put on her coat and hat he experienced a keen sense of disappointment, for he was realising it had been in his mind to escort her to work. Whether Mick would have proposed this he did not know; he only knew that the desire had been there; but it seemed to be the pattern that she and her uncle left together at dinnertime. She was standing in front of him and when, conventionally, she held out her hand towards him, saying, ‘Goodbye, then,’ he hesitated for a moment; then his arm jerked forward and he was holding her hand. He felt the warmth of it flowing up his arm like an injection; it was as if everything in her was being transmitted through their palms. But as quickly as his arm had gone out, it returned to his side, jerked back there as if by a spring; and he noticed that his action hadn't gone unnoticed by Mick. He now watched Mick follow Carrie to the door way that led into the scullery, and he found himself also stepping in that direction, until he could take in the whole of the scullery and the open backyard door through which Mr Carver was now passing, saying as he did so, ‘Ta-rah, then.’ It was a salutation to cover all those present. Then he saw Carrie turn and look at Mick and Mick take her by the shoulders and look down into her face. He heard him speak some words, but he couldn't make out what they were; he then saw him bend  and kiss her, not on the cheek but on the lips. Then Mrs Carver's voice from behind him cried, ‘Out of me way! lad,’ and he sprang aside to let her enter the scullery with a tray of dirty cups and saucers. 3rd September, 1939 ‘Mother! Mother! listen. Will you stop ranting and listen. Look! Now look! War's been declared and all you can think about, all you can talk about is what you're going to do if I don't stop seeing Carrie.’ ‘I don't care about war being declared or anything else.’ Ellen Jebeau's back was bent, her head thrust out. At this moment she looked to Joe like a witch and her voice and words sounded as ominous as any that could have been uttered by an authentic witch, as she hissed at him, ‘I am more concerned about what happens to you than what a lot of stupid men do in their aim to kill each other. Don't you yet understand, boy, what you mean to me? You are all I've got, all I've got left to build my life on; my life has been one long frustration, and to stand aside and see you throw yourself away on scum like…’ ‘Don't you dare call Carrie scum!’ ‘And don't you dare, boy, speak to me like that!’ She had advanced a step further towards him until now they were standing almost breast to breast. ‘I am your mother. I have worked for you in all ways practically from the moment you were born and I'd die rather than see you throw yourself away on the likes of her; for she is scum , and I repeat it,scum . She hails from scum. Just look at her mother and the rest of them.’ He was unable to speak but he glared back into her infuriated countenance, and when she said, ‘And don't bring Mary and Mick up as examples of paragons, for Mary is really witless; she's a good servant and nothing more. As for Mick aiming to rise above himself, he'll never do it. And he's crafty; you can see it in his face. And I know he's behind your meetings with that girl. Doubtless he wants to see her established in this house.’ It was now he who stepped back from her, almost pushing her aside with his forearm as he said, ‘Don't be ridiculous. Neither you nor I have any claim on this house, and you know it. When I marry I can't live here. As for you, Mother, when Martin marries it'll be Uncle's case all over again; you'll either have to step down and be housekeeper or go.’ His lips were still purse on the last words when they suddenly sprang wide as he saw her almost stagger back from him, her hand to her throat, the colour draining from her face. This was the sort of reaction that usually followed a burst of temper bordering on rage. As she groped towards a chair he made no move towards her but watched her sit down, then bow her head for a moment before slowly raising her eyes to his again when, in a voice that had lost none of its bitterness, she said ‘Leave me; but I'm warning you, I'll see you dead first, before you take that girl.’ He was still visibly shaken when he entered his own room where, going to the window, he placed both hands on the sill and bowed his head. She was mad. She was mad, she was; she was mad. ‘Joe!’ His head came up sharply. ‘You there, Joe?’ That was Martin. He went hastily towards the door; he didn't want Martin to come into the room because then he might break down and say things about his mother that were best left unsaid. They met on the stairhead and Martin cried, ‘You've heard the news then?’ ‘Yes, it's awful, isn't it?’ ‘Oh, I wouldn't say that, laddie.’ Martin put his arm around Joe's shoulders and together they went down the stairs. ‘Come, let's have a drink before we're blown to smithereens; they'll likely start at any time.’ ‘You think so?’ ‘Oh sure of it. There'll be bombs popping all over the place. They're bound to make Tyneside an early target. They're already organising air-raid precautions, and children are to be evacuated. Soon everybody'll be busy doing something, even right out here. What are you going to have? Whisky? Sherry?’ ‘A sherry, please.’ He followed Martin to the drinks cabinet that stood in a corner of the hall. ‘What's the matter with you?’ Martin asked. ‘Not frightened of the war, are you?’ ‘No…no.’ ‘Then what's up? Had words with Mama?’ There was a long pause before Joe answered, ‘Yes, something like that.’ ‘Take it in your stride, laddie, take it in your stride. Anyway, in a few months’ time you might be called up.’ ‘Do you think so?’ ‘Sure of it; you'll be eighteen at Christmas. Harry knew what he was doing, didn't he? He's a fully  fledged pilot now. Lucky dog.’ And as he handed Joe his drink he added, ‘I'm going in tomorrow.’ ‘What do you mean? To join up?’ ‘Yes. I've seen the partners; they agree it's the right thing to do.’ ‘I'll miss you.’ Martin's voice was low, with a note of sadness in it now, as he said, ‘We'll miss each other, but still, that's life. Here, drink to it.’ They clinked their glasses; then Martin, walking towards the long window, said, ‘It's a good job I didn't become engaged; you shouldn't get married at a time like this.’ Joe's eyes widened as he asked, ‘You…you were thinking about getting married?’ ‘Yes. Yes.’ ‘Who to?’ The question sounded naive to his ears. ‘Marion, Marion Crosbie; you know, the Hallidays’ niece; you've met her.’ ‘Oh, yes, Miss Crosbie. She's the dark-haired one.’ ‘Yes’— Martin now laughed —‘the raven-haired one. Some girl… Marion.’ Of a sudden Joe was thankful that a war had been declared: Martin would join up and, because of his principles, he wouldn't then marry Miss Crosbie. That would be one less thing for him to worry about with regards to his mother, for she would still be mistress of the house, at least until the war was over, which might go on for a year, perhaps two. For most people in England the war hadn't yet begun. The general opinion was that it had fizzled out; like a spent squib, it hadn't even given one burst. It was a fortnight now since it had started with such a hullabaloo, but there had been no raids, and no bombs  had been dropped; the sirens went and people made for the shelters, but more and more half-heartedly, as days passed and nothing exciting happened. The only thing that seemed to be stirring most people was their scorn of Chamberlain. Of course there was the black-out, and that was enforced, and everybody had to carry gas masks. There were no street lights any more and cars couldn't use their headlights, and it was being said that more people were being killed this way than if a real war had come upon them. Joe should have gone back to school the previous week but it was being used as an evacuation centre. The upper school were remaining but it would be at least another week before he'd have to return. The war hadn't seemed to touch the house, that is until the morning a lady arrived in a car from Hexham. She asked Ellen how many children she was prepared to take. She got no further than the hall and Ellen's answer could have been heard in every corner of the house: ‘None!’ ‘None?’ said the lady. ‘None,’ repeated Ellen. ‘You might be forced to,’ said the lady quietly. ‘Then you'll have to go over the heads of the military and Sir Martin, for he's thinking of using this house as a convalescent base for officers.’ ‘Oh,’ said the lady, slightly mollified. ‘Oh, I'm sorry.’ ‘Good morning.’ The lady went out and drove away and Joe, who had witnessed the meeting, went into the kitchen where Mary was saying to Helen, ‘Eeh! the lies rolled off her like butter off a hot griddle.’ ‘There's no truth in it at all then, you don't think?’ said Helen. ‘Not a word,’ said Mary. Then turning to Joe she asked, ‘You, Master Joe, you've heard nothing about officers coming here, have you?’ ‘No, Mary,’ he said. ‘No’— Mary turned to her sister —‘no, it's as I said, the lies.’ Then realising to whom she was referring she stopped and, embarrassed now, she muttered, ‘Well, it was a fib in a good cause; we don't want bairns scampering around this place, do we?’ ‘No, I suppose not,’ he answered. ‘You suppose not? Aye, Master Joe, you'd suppose not if you saw some of them from the towns. Lousy they are, their hair nearly walks by itself. I tell you I know. You can't help getting a nit or a dickie at school, but some of those town bairns are lousy. Oh, we don't want any like that here. Your mother was quite right. Do you want a scone?’ ‘Yes, please.’ She split open a newly baked scone and thickened it with butter and as she handed it to him she added, ‘There's rationing comin', that's what they say, curtailing the food; well, it won't affect us, havin' cows and sheep an' chickens. But those pigs are more bloomin' nuisance than the horses. What do you say, Master Joe?’ ‘Yes, yes, I suppose so.’ He smiled at her, the while thinking, why was it he always sounded inane when talking to any of the Smiths, with the exception of Mick? He didn't even show up brightly with Carrie. ‘You suppose so? Well, I should think so; you'd grumble if you didn't get your butter, wouldn't you?’ He smiled broadly and he turned from her, munching at the buttered scone, and as he walked out of the back door he heard the sound of a car coming on to the gravel in front of the house. By the time he reached the end of the yard Martin was already out of the car and was running up the steps to the house. Joe paused for a moment. He knew that Martin had seen him and yet he had taken no notice of him. Was something wrong? Swallowing the last of the scone he ran over the drive and into the house to see Martin disappearing into the study. He did not go towards the study door because his mother, coming down the stairs, called, ‘Who was that… Martin?’ ‘Yes.’ He nodded. ‘He's gone into the study.’ She made for the study door and he wanted to say, ‘I wouldn't if I were you; he's in a tear about something,’ but he knew that even if he did speak it wouldn't deter her. He was a little way behind her when she knocked on the study door. When there was no response she slowly turned the handle and pushed the door open. Looking to the side. of her, he could see Martin standing with his arms folded and resting on the mantelshelf. ‘May I come in?’ It was some seconds before Martin turned towards them and said, ‘Yes, yes; come in.’ Joe followed his mother into the room, and they stood looking at Martin, who had his back to the empty grate now and was staring at them as if he wasn't seeing them. Then his words came in a mutter so unlike his usual jaunty tones as he announced, ‘They won't have me.’ Ellen stepped forward now, saying, ‘You mean there's something wrong?’ ‘My eyes.’ He tapped his right eye with his fore finger. ‘Colour blind or some such thing. Damn rubbish. Did you ever hear anything like it? Colour blind. And me who's been firing a gun from when I was practically able to walk. Colour blind.’ Joe listened to his mother saying flatly, ‘Colour wouldn't affect your aim.’ ‘No, I know. I said that.’ He flung around from them and walked to the end of the room. ‘What did they say? Have they offered you any thing at all?’ ‘Oh, yes, yes’— he nodded his head at her over his shoulder —‘a desk job somewhere. I've been at a desk for years; I want no more of it and I told them. I told Ratler, you know, Colonel Ratler from over at Bellingham. He suggested I stay and farm the land. Farm the land, be damned! Most of it hasn't been turned over for years. And what do they expect to grow on these hills?’ ‘What was decided?’ Ellen's question was quiet. ‘Nothing, nothing; they're to let me know, and they'll likely do that on the day they say the war's ended.’ Of a sudden he sat down in a chair and Joe, looking at him, had a strange thought, for his mind was saying that if men could cry, Martin would be crying now. He was about to take a step towards him when his mother said, ‘Troubles never come singly. I'd better tell you I've had a call from Harry. He's going into hospital. He says it's nothing, just a check-up.’ Martin was on his feet. ‘What time was this?’ ‘Oh, about ten this morning. he left a number where you can get him. It's on the pad in the hall.’ As he passed her he stopped and said, ‘He didn't give you any idea what was wrong?’ ‘No, nothing. He sounded quite cheery. Just a check-up, he said. Perhaps…perhaps he's going abroad; they do have medicals before they're sent overseas, so I understand.’ ‘Yes, yes, that's right, yes.’ He was nodding at her, obviously relieved now, and turning to Joe, he thrust out his hand and rumpled his hair as he said, ‘Such is fate. As I was saying to you the other day, laddie, because I was aiming to be a fighting man I wouldn't get married. But now there's nothing to stop me, is there, eh?’ He jerked his chin to the side; then seeming to stretch himself inches upwards, he thrust out his chin and marched from the room. Joe turned and looked at his mother. She had her eyes on the figure striding across the hall towards the telephone table, and the look on her face caused him to close his own eyes for a moment, for he knew how she had taken what Martin had said: although it had been voiced lightly it was meant to have serious intent, and in her own mind his marrying would mean once again that she would have notice to quit. ‘Well, it's up to you, Aunt Ellen, whether you stay or go. But one thing I won't tolerate is your continued manner towards Marion. You have shown your dislike of her since she first entered the house.’ ‘She dislikes me.’ ‘Well, you've given her cause from the beginning, haven't you? And get it into your head, Aunt Ellen, we're engaged to be married. You know —’ He pulled in his chin as he looked at her before continuing, ‘It's odd, but none of the other girls I've brought to the house over the years have seemed to arouse your animosity. And why? Because you thought I wasn't serious. But now that I am, you see Marion as a threat to your position. I know I'm speaking plain, but this is a time for plain speaking. Don't you think so?’ Ellen Jebeau brought her lips tightly together and drew them inwards between her teeth before she said, with deep bitterness, ‘I don't know about it being a time for plain speaking, I can only say that time has shown your ingratitude for what I've done for you over the years.’ ‘Done for me!’ They had been seated each side of the blazing fire in the drawing-room, but now Martin had sprung to his feet, his voice raised as he repeated, ‘Done for me ! Oh, come on, come on, Aunt Ellen, think. Father took you and the youngster in twelve…no, thirteen years ago; he made it possible for you not only to live comfortably but well, and to educate the laddie. I took on where he left off…what have you done for me? Now, now! let's put matters straight. Besides being allowed to play mistress of this house for years, you've been given a good allowance. And, if I remember rightly, Father was not only going to continue that allowance but had bought a house for you, hadn't he? Well, I can't promise that if you leave I'll be as generous as he was; I'll continue your allowance certainly, but as for a house, no; for as you are well aware, because you know the books as well as I do, it takes us all our time, even with my salary, to continue living here as we have done of yore. So don't speak to me of ingratitude. And just in case I may say things I'll be sorry for, I'd better not go on, except for one last word. My wedding is set for April; whether I'm called up or not, it's going through. It could have been different if I had been accepted for the Forces, but this way I mean to make Marion my wife and I hope…well…well’— he jerked his head upwards —‘I may as well say it, that if I have a son, or for second best, a daughter, to carry on here. It may seem that I've never taken my title seriously, but below the skin I have great respect for it, and for this house too and the men who have gone before me who made it. So having said that, I advise you, Aunt Ellen, to see to your own plans.’ He moved a step or two from her. Then, turning and looking into her tight, white countenance, he added and quietly, ‘On second thoughts, I think it would be better if you decided definitely to make arrangements to live elsewhere. In fact, as things stand I see it as the only  course for you to take… But,’ he added kindly, ‘there is no immediate hurry until April.’ As he made for the door he heard the phone ringing in the hall and when he entered he saw Joe turn from the telephone table towards him, saying, ‘It's for you, Martin. It's…it's from the hospital, I think.’ Martin strode quickly towards him, picked up the phone, said, ‘Yes?’ then listened; and as he did so his head began to move in small jerks as he looked from side to side. When at last he placed the phone down he turned and gazed at Joe, saying in a bewildered tone, ‘It's Harry; they…they want me to go at once.’ Joe moved towards him, asking now, ‘Is he bad?’ ‘Apparently so.’ Before he finished speaking he had sprung towards the stairs and up them, shouting now, ‘It'll be a longish drive; ask Mary to put something up for me; soup or something.’ ‘Yes, yes.’ Joe ran to the kitchen, and was still giving Mary the order when his mother appeared in the doorway, saying, ‘What is it?’ He turned to her: ‘A message from the hospital, Harry's ill. They've…they've asked Martin to go straightaway.’ He watched her walk away without speaking and enter the hall again; he had expected her to come to the table to supervise Mary packing up the food. Mary had already pushed the soup pan onto the heart of the fire, and she said to him now, Get me the thermos, will you, Master Joe, and the picnic basket out of the bottom cupboard.’ Within a few minutes the basket was more than half full of food, and Mary was pouring the soup into the thermos. She was screwing the top on when Martin entered the kitchen. ‘Is he so bad, Mr Martin?’ she said. ‘I don't really know, Mary, but it would appear so. Oh’— he looked into the basket —‘I'm not going for a week; I just wanted a sandwich or two. But thanks.’ Joe picked up the picnic basket and the thermos flask from the table, and together he and Martin went out and across the dark courtyard towards the garage. Martin took his seat in the car and was about to start her up when Joe leant towards him and asked, ‘Would you like me to come with you, Martin?’ Martin looked at him for a moment and smiled softly at him as he said, ‘I would, laddie, but you'd better not; I think your mother needs you tonight. She's had a bit of a blow. I'm sorry I had to deliver it, but there it is.’ The message in the words sounded ominous to Joe's ears, and he straightened up and said, ‘Tell Harry I'll be thinking of him and I hope he'll be home soon.’ ‘I'll do that.’ The car gave a roar, then slowly moved out of the garage; the dim side-lights showed a pale flicker on the back of the house, then swung around for an instant on to the gardens. The next second the light was gone and Martin with it, and Joe stood in the yard oblivious of the fact that he was without a coat and that the cold was seeping through his pullover, for his outer self was no colder than the feeling within him that had been evoked by Martin's last words concerning his mother. He drew in a deep icy breath, then straightened his shoulders, a habit he was forcing upon himself a lot of late, then made  his way towards the kitchen, to be greeted by Mary with, ‘He's gone then?’ ‘Yes, Mary, he's gone.’ That was all he said, and he surprised her some. what by walking quickly up the kitchen and into the hall. He would generally stop and have a word or two or listen to her. He was a good listener; he was about the only one in the house that was these days. Everybody seemed to be in a rush. It was the war, she supposed. She got a bit lonely when she was on by herself at nights. Things were changing in the house — you could feel it — and there was trouble brewing. She had only to look at Mrs Jebeau's face to see it; in fact, she could smell trouble in that direction. She was a funny woman, was Mrs Jebeau, nervy; what they called neurotic, she would think. ‘Yes’— she nodded to herself —‘that was the word, neurotic, which accounted for her nerves and her funny temper too.’ Going through Joe's mind as he mounted the stairs were thoughts which were very similar, except that he expressed his in a slightly different way. His mother, he knew, was in for another of her bouts, and he would have to bear the brunt of it. He should be used to them by now because they had become a frequent occurrence during the past few months, particularly since Martin had been bringing Miss Crosbie to the house. He had to think of her as Miss Crosbie so he wouldn't again make the mistake that had aroused his mother's anger when he had spoken of her as Marion. as if he were a child of five she had reprimanded him, saying, ‘Don't be so personal; she is Miss Crosbie. And don't address her by any other name.’ It was almost a running dive he made across the gallery and to his bedroom, but he did it on tip-toe. He had no doubt that his mother was in her bedroom and that if she heard him she would come into his room and it would start, he knew it would: the upbraiding of Martin, and he wouldn't be able to stand it without checking her. It came to him that he could lock the door, there was a bolt on it, but this conjured up the vision of her battering on it, for she certainly wouldn't be deterred by the fact that she was raising the house; she would know that Mary was the only one in it at the moment. In his room he pulled on a dressing-gown and sat down and waited. He waited fifteen minutes, which seemed like hours, and still she didn't come. And he knew she was next door because he had heard her moving about. Half an hour later he took off the dressing-gown and decided to go downstairs. He was puzzled: he could not understand this new tactic. Why was she leaving him alone? Martin returned the following evening. Harry had died of pneumonia after an operation on his kidneys. Joe, looking dumbly at him as he stood in the hall, saw a man whose youth seemed to have fled from him. He was standing well apart from them as he gave Joe and his mother the details, and as the tears rolled down his cheeks Joe sensed a great loneliness in his cousin that seemed to link up with a similar feeling within himself, and he was drawn to Martin to put his arms about him, and when their faces touched both were wet. ‘Where's your gas mask?’ ‘In its box.’ ‘You'll say that once too often.’ Carrie slanted her eyes and nodded her head at Joe as she added, ‘And you can get into trouble for not carrying it.’ ‘That'll be light to the trouble I'll be in soon.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘They say it could come any time — calling up.’ ‘Oh, that.’ They stopped and faced each other. Then Carrie jumped aside as a passing bus threw up some slush from the gutter, and as she brushed her hands down over the bottom of her coat, she said, ‘You'd think they did it on purpose,’ and as he went to assist her she stayed his hands, saying, ‘It'll only make it worse. Anyway, what does it matter? You were saying about being called up.’ They were walking on again. ‘Yes, I was saying…’ ‘You want to go?’ ‘Yes and no. It all depends where I land.’ He stopped again and, taking her firmly now by the arm, pulled her into a shop doorway and, looking into her eyes, he said, ‘If it wasn't for leaving you I'd be glad to go, and…and I thought you'd be proud of me going.’ ‘Oh, Joe’— she turned her head slowly to the side —‘don't start on that again; you…you know nothing can come of it.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Look, don't be silly.’ She pressed her lips tightly together for a moment. ‘You're asking the road you know, it's been spelled out so many times: the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate. Only the poor man happens to be me.’ ‘That's daft, rubbish. Look, there's a war on, every body's changing. Everything will be changed after it. And, anyway, what are you talking about, the rich man in his castle? When Martin marries next month she'll be out. Mother, I mean. She hasn't said anything, but she knows all right. Even if Martin wanted her to stay, Marion can't stand her. And I don't blame her, the way she's been received. At the same time, though, I can see Mother's side of it, at least on this one point, for she hasn't considered herself as being just a housekeeper all these years, she's felt mistress of the place, and she's going to miss it.’ ‘Will you?’ The question was direct and he blinked for a moment before answering: ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘honestly yes, I will. It's a lovely house, it's a lovely place. And I'll miss…well, I'll miss Martin. We've…we've always been close, but more so since Harry went. But in a way I'll be glad when he's married; he'll have someone really of his own then.’ ‘Will you really be glad when he marries?’ ‘Of course I shall. What makes you ask?’ ‘Oh, just that…well, he could have children.’ ‘Well, I expect he will have.’ ‘And you don't mind?’ ‘No, I don't mind. And I know what you're thinking.’ ‘Yes, of course you know what I'm thinking, be cause you are next in line for the title and all it entails. And what if Martin doesn't have any children; or, say, if he were to die in the war and you survived, what then… Sir Joseph Bartholomew Jebeau?’ ‘Oh! Carrie .’ Joe turned away from her, thrusting his hands deep into his overcoat pockets, and he sounded very like Martin himself as he growled out, ‘Suppose, suppose, suppose. There's as much chance of that happening as…’ When he hesitated Carrie ended, ‘As your mother greeting me with open arms. I know, I know. And yet I'm wrong, there's more chance of that happening than your mother ever looking upon me with favour. Why, if she knew we were meeting, she'd go mad. You know she would. Every time you want to see me you have to make an excuse, haven't you, tell a fib of some sort? There's times I don't see you for weeks on end.’ ‘That isn't my fault.’ He turned on her now, but was almost pushed aside as someone came out of the shop. And so he took her arm and pulled her into the street again and, still holding her arm, he said, ‘And what do you think I feel like when I don't see you and knowing you're away dancing with that John Bennett or that Sweetman fellow?’ ‘Well, what do you expect me to do? Sit in the house and wait for you coming? And look, don't drag me any further, Joe, please. See where we are! This is where I work, remember?’ They stopped just beyond the steps of the food office and, all the irritation seeming to flow from him, he  looked at her meekly now as he said, ‘I may not see you again for weeks. I don't know what's going to happen, so, Carrie, I must say it — I've implied it in a thousand different ways for months now — I… I love you, Carrie. Looking back, I can't remember a time when I didn't love you. Do…do you love me?’ Her head was bent and her words were hardly audible above the noise of the traffic as she said, ‘What's the good in loving someone you…you can never have?’ ‘But we can, you can. I don't care what my mother thinks, or anybody else, I'd… I'd marry you tomorrow if you'd have me. Will you…will you, Carrie?’ Carrie lifted her head and looked at him, and what she saw was a young boy, the same young boy she had known when she lived in the cottage. She didn't see the dark nineteen-year-old youth, for he didn't look nineteen: there was hardly any stubble on his chin, his face was pale, his mouth tender, his clear grey eyes filled with the hurt of love. She saw the boy who wrote poetry, and she loved him, but as the boy, not as the youth or the budding man. She thought of her brothers. They had all appeared to be like men when they were sixteen, especially Mick. Mick had always been like a man to her. Oh Mick, Mick was something. Oh yes, their Mick was something. And he understood Joe. He had explained his character to her by saying, ‘He lives half in the air; it's only his toes that touch the ground.’ She remembered him laughing kindly as he said this, because he liked Joe, he liked Joe very much; but at the same time he felt guilty about him, because in a way he had made use of him as a sort of cover. Her mind swung away from her brother and she told herself that she couldn't see herself spending her life with someone whose toes were just touching the ground; her nature demanded stability. She knew she had been brought up these last few years with her Aunt Alice and Uncle Stan because of the instability at home. Of course that had been mostly created by the lack of money, but the instability she saw in Joe wasn't that kind of lack, it was something she couldn't put her finger on. But Mick's description of him sort of fitted. Yes; nevertheless, he was nice. She liked him, she liked him a lot. Perhaps she loved him. She didn't really know. Could you love two people…two men like that? There was no answer. ‘Look, Joe, I've got to go.’ She put out her hand as if warding him off. ‘I'm late already.’ ‘You…you don't care for me? You don't even like me?’ ‘Don't be silly.’ She took a step towards him. ‘You know I like you. But…but I'm not ready yet for what you want.’ She knew she was lying, and she went on lying. ‘I… I don't want to be tied down to anyone, and…and things are so uncertain with the war and all that. But…but I do like you, I like you a lot, Joe. Get that into your head, I like you a lot.’ ‘But you don't love me?’ His voice was flat. ‘Oh, why must you harp on about that! Look, I've got to go. Bye-bye.’ She backed two steps from him, then turned and ran towards the building. He remained where he was. The weight in his heart seemed to have tethered him to the pavement, and he had to force himself to turn away, and some seconds after she had disappeared through the doorway. What would he do without her? He wouldn't be able to  love anybody else but her, ever. When some part of his mind prompted the words that he had heard so often, boyish fancy, his inside actually jerked in protest. It was no boyish fancy, the feelings he had for her; they seemed to have been born in him. They had lain dormant for some years after she had left the cottage, but he knew now they had simply been growing in the warm darkness of his being where love bred… He had to meet Martin at four o'clock and he had to kill time till then. He did so by wandering the streets, and when for the second time he passed the food office where she worked, he knew what he was going to do. He was going to face up to his mother when he got home and have it out. If he could convince her that nothing she could say or do would make him change his mind about Carrie, the way would be open for him to prove to Carrie he had enough love for the two of them. But there was so little time left now, for he could get his papers any day… He had the urge to run. He had been so quiet on the journey home that Martin said to him, ‘What's up, laddie?’ and when Joe had replied, ‘Everything,’Martin had nodded his head, saying simply, ‘Carrie?’ It had been almost a minute before Joe replied, ‘Yes, Carrie.’ ‘Well, better finish it now, laddie, because no good will come of you marrying into that lot. Oh, I know, I know.’ He had taken one hand from the wheel and held it up in protest. ‘She's a nice girl, what I've seen of her, the best of the bunch, I should say, next to Mick and, of course, Dick. Old Dick's all right, but  if you marry her you'll be marrying her family… Does she feel the same way as you?’ When Joe gave no immediate answer Martin had sighed as he said, ‘There are a lot of women in the world, laddie, thousands and thousands of ‘em. And the right one is among them, the right one for you, that is. Some day you'll come across her and you'll know it, as soon as you look at her, you'll know it. As I know it. Something goes bang inside your belly. And as often as you tell yourself she's not your type, that you don't like blondes, your taste tends towards the browns, even redheads but not blondes, no; and what's more, her face is round, but you don't like round faces; and you've always gone in for a bit of shape and she's flat as a pancake. You're not having any of that, you tell yourself, but you're hooked, laddie, you're hooked.’ He had glanced laughingly at Joe, and Joe had known he was describing his future wife, but his words had brought no consolation to him… It seemed to Joe that his mother was waiting behind the hall door for him, because no sooner had he entered the house than there she was, staring at him over the distance. ‘I want you upstairs a moment,’ she said. Her voice was quiet, controlled. He turned his head and glanced to where Martin was taking off his overcoat, and Martin raised his eyebrows, pursed his lips and nodded his head, the action saying, ‘You're in for it again, laddie.’ By the time he reached the gallery his mother was at the far end of the broad corridor, but she wasn't going into her room or into his room, she was making for the attic stairs, and now it was his turn  to raise his eyebrows. What on earth did she want him up there for? But he knew why the moment he entered the old schoolroom, for after allowing him to pass her she closed the door and stood with her back to it, her pale face, now tinged to a deep red, thrust out towards him as she cried, ‘Think you're smart, don't you? Lying, sneaking, crawling individual that you've become, and all to see that little slut. Well, it's finished. Do you hear? You attempt to go near her again and I'll make it my business to go across there…’ ‘Shut up!’ She shut up and her mouth fell into a gape, the sweat appeared in globules on her upper lip, the colour deepened in her face and she seemed to have to force breath into her lungs as she listened to him now saying, ‘You'll not tell me any more what I've got to do and what I haven't got to do. I've made up my own mind what I'm going to do. I'm sick and tired of your domination. Do you hear? Do you hear me?’ He had actually taken a step towards her. ‘If I want to see Carrie, I'll see Carrie, in spite of you or anyone else. Do you hear me?’ She blinked rapidly now; then, her face becoming suffused with an anger that seemed to send out rays of heat towards him, she cried, ‘Yes, I hear you. And now you hear me. I'm your mother and I forbid you to take that tone with me. But the first thing I've got to say to you here and now is you're no more capable of keeping a wife than of keeping a —’ she seemed to search for the word, then brought out, ‘rabbit. You've been at school for years and what have you achieved? Nothing. The only thing you can do is scribble; and what is the result of your  scribblings? Mediocre stuff, stupid rhymes. What's going to happen to you without me behind you? Have you ever asked yourself that? And here you are, eighteen and you don't even know what you are going to do. Go to university… Huh! and waste more years.’ She now drew her chin into her chest and in a voice almost as deep as a man's she said, ‘And you dare to tell me to shut up, me! who's given her life to you. From the moment you were born your future has been my one aim, and now to see your trailing after that little slut, you who are in line for a title…’ ‘What?’ The anger that the insults to his intelligence had aroused in him was put aside by the amazement that surrounded the question, and again he mouthed, ‘What?’ then added, ‘In line! You really must be mad; I'm… I'm as much in line for the title as the rabbit you inferred a moment ago I'd be unable to support. Martin and Marion will have a family. She wants a family; I've heard her say so, and she'll have a family, and I hope it's a big one, ten, twelve… In line, indeed!’ While they glared at each other he recalled that Carrie had said something similar earlier in the day. ‘Don't be stupid.’ She was biting on her lip now as if regretting her words; then she added, ‘It isn't every woman that can bear a child, and she doesn't look a child-bearer to me. And I have a feeling-’ She now drew in a long breath before resuming ‘And it's more than a feeling, it's a certainty that, although we're leaving here, being forced to leave here, we'll return, for this is our home. If…if  everyone had their rights I should be legal mistress of this place now. Whether you've known it or not, I was your uncle's mistress for years, and he would have married me. Yes, yes, he would.’ She nodded her head before adding, ‘But a man can't marry his brother's wife. It was a dirty quirk of fate. I… I feel I've been robbed, all along the line I feel I've been robbed. But it can't go on forever. No, it won't go on forever and, I repeat, we'll come back here one day. I know inside.’ She thumped her chest. When she stopped speaking his feeling of animosity towards her seeped from him, and the pity that he always felt for her again rose to the surface and for a moment he himself knew the extent of her frustration and the reason behind her furious tantrums when she had known his uncle was going to marry again. He could see now that she was placed in an almost similar position, for with Martin marrying, she was once more being cast adrift. He thought for a moment that if she would only accept his feelings for Carrie he would go to her this minute and put his arms about her and comfort her, but he knew she would never accept Carrie. But then Carrie hadn't accepted him, had she? So what was stopping him from going to her and telling her that she had no need to worry? Whatever it was, it was like a wall between them and he was honest enough to admit to himself that most of the time he was building on it brick by brick in order to blot her out of his sight…forever. He watched her now lean against the door, her body slumped, her eyes closed. Of a sudden she looked old. She was forty-six: her face was unlined, her hair still golden without grey in it, her body trim, very trim, yet he seemed to be looking at an old woman. Pity  for her again seeped through until, opening her eyes, she said, and in a quiet appealing voice now, ‘Promise me, Joe, you won't see that girl again.’ It was on the tip of his tongue to say, ‘I'll do no such thing,’ but he found himself compromising by saying, ‘I'm going to join up.’ ‘You're going to what?’ ‘Join up.’ She moved her head slowly now and seemed to be making an effort to speak, and then she muttered, ‘You'll be getting your calling up papers eventually, in any case, so why…? Please.’ She now straightened up and extended her hand towards him, and again she said, ‘Please’— then added his name —‘Joe. Don't…don't go until you must. Don't leave me…until I get over this. I mean the move. You…you don't know what it's costing me.’ He turned from her now, shaking his head, saying, ‘I'm… I'm sorry but…but I must do it.’ He had his back to her and he stood waiting for another outburst, but when neither answer nor movement came to him he turned his head slowly and looked at her over his shoulder. She was standing straight, looking in his direction but seemingly through him, and the strange look on her face brought him around fully, and he was about to speak, not with the intention of giving her the true version of why he wanted to volunteer, for it wasn't in him to hurt her to that extent, but she turned from him and, quietly opening the door, went out. Her exit caused him more concern than if she had made it in the blaze of anger similar to that with which she had first confronted him. He put a hand to his brow and now out of all she had said there  came into his mind her words: ‘You couldn't support a rabbit.’ And they stabbed at him and caused his whole body to tremble as if in shame because, in a way, he knew she was right: his inadequacy to face his future was there for even himself to see; he had considered volunteering in order to avoid the responsibility of making the choice either of going to University to read for a degree in English Literature or of just plumping for a teacher's training college course. Why was life like this? There was a high wind blowing. The night had turned rough and the rattle from the windows had seemed to be emphasised by the silence during supper. They had almost finished eating when Martin spoke. as if following up a train of thought, he looked across at Joe, saying, ‘I wonder if those thieving scoundrels will be on the prowl again tonight?’ and Joe answered, ‘I shouldn't think they'd have the nerve to make a third trip, not in the same week, anyway.’ ‘Those beggars have got the nerve and cunning to tackle anything. But there's one thing sure, next time they come on this land they'll be met by a reception committee. Oh, yes.’ ‘Who's on tonight?’ ‘Paxstone, and I've given him orders to shoot and be damned. If those devils can wring the necks of chickens and slit the throats of sheep, then they shouldn't object to some shot, should they?’ He poked his head slightly towards Joe, and after a moment's hesitation Joe said, ‘He would really shoot them?’ ‘Yes, yes, indeed; aim for the legs to bring them down. Oh —’ He now thrust out his hand in a flapping movement, saying, ‘Don't look like that, there's nobody going to be murdered.’ ‘What…what if those men have guns too?’ ‘Oh, I wouldn't think so. But then you never know; they're probably ready to poach anything. No, you never know.’ Ellen Jebeau rose from the table, and they made the gesture of rising too. She was addressing Martin as she said, ‘If there's nothing further you want of me, I think I'll go to bed. Mary will be here till eight.’ ‘Of course, of course .’ Martin had pulled himself up to his feet now and he held on to the back of the chair as he nodded at her, then watched her go towards the door. Before she reached it, however, it was opened and Mary entered the room. Mary looked first at Ellen and then towards Martin as she said, ‘It's…it's me dad, sir. He's been to say that Bernard has put his wrist out, and it being Danny's day off he went for Bill, but Bill's gone over to see his mother in Consett, so he says, what about it, sir?’ ‘Oh. Martin chewed on his lip for a moment. ‘Tell him not to worry, I'll go.’ As the door closed on both Ellen Jebeau and Mary, Martin turned to the table and as he sat down said, ‘Damn nuisance. And we really need two men out there, but I can't ask more of them than they're doing; they're making up for one short as it is. And this snow lying doesn't help.’ ‘Let me come with you tonight, Martin.’ ‘Oh no. Oh no .’ Martin turned to look at him, a twisted grin on his face. ‘You want your mother after me?’ ‘She's not to know; she'll be fast asleep before then.’ ‘What if there's a scrap and I do have to fire at them and they return it; for after all, as I've said, we don't really know whether they carry guns; all we know is they haven't used them yet.’ ‘Well’— Joe laughed now —‘it'll give me a bit of practice before I'm introduced to the real thing, and that shouldn't be long now.’ ‘Oh.’ Martin nodded at him now, his face serious. ‘But that shouldn't be for a while, they're not calling the twenties up yet… You want to go?’ ‘Oh, yes, yes; in fact —’ He dropped his head now and, picking up his pudding spoon, he traced it round his empty plate before he said, ‘I'm going to volunteer.’ ‘You are! Well! Why didn't you say so before? Oh, you thought I might be upset. That's you, Joe, that's you. No, I'm over that. Does your mother know?’ ‘Yes. Yes, I… I told her tonight.’ ‘Oh my! Oh my! I don't need to ask how she took it.’ ‘No.’ ‘You're going to find it tough, Joe; I mean, Army life. You decided on the Army? No?’ ‘No, the Air Force. I fancy flying, something to do with flying, anyway.’ ‘Oh, they'll take you for that, all right; they're fishing for them like mackerel.’ There was a pause before he ended, ‘Your mother's going to be lonely, you know that, don't you, Joe?’ ‘Yes, yes, I do.’ Tapping his cheese knife in rhythm on the edge of the table, Martin said, ‘I don't know whether you've noticed, but there's never been much love lost between your mother and me. She liked Harry. Well, who didn't? who wouldn't? but she's never cottoned on to me, and so I don't know whether or not she's  told you…oh, to put it plainly, I had to give her her marching orders.’ ‘Yes, yes, I thought you had to.’ ‘But she hasn't told you?’ ‘No; but…but I guessed something like that had happened from what you said a while back.’ ‘She's got a decent allowance and they're wanting women in all kinds of work now. She…she needn't be on her own. Well, not in that way. But, nevertheless, I know she'll miss this house. Most of all she'll miss you. But there it is, that's life, and she should know, if anyone does, that there's no straight path in it. Well’— he sighed —‘what's the time?’ He turned to look at the clock. ‘Quarter past eight. I think I'll go and change my clothes and have a drink to fortify me, because it'll be damned cold out there tonight… Listen to that wind! It's getting stronger.’ He rose to his feet now, smiling and, putting an arm around Joe's shoulder, he said, ‘What are you going to do with yourself?’ ‘Oh, I don't know.’ ‘Well, it's too early to go to bed and the rooms are like ice. The drawing-room's nice and warm; go in there.’ They went into the hall together; then Joe watched Martin take the stairs two at a time, and the maleness of him, his virility seemed to leave an aroma behind him. He remained standing looking up the stairs. He wished he could be like Martin, if only in some small way, because he had the feeling he lacked something. ‘You couldn't support a rabbit.’ Was it because his mind tended towards thinking about things, musing over them instead of tackling  them? Or was there a deficiency in his make-up in the maleness of him? No. No . His whole body jerked in denial as he made for the drawing-room. He was male all right. Inside he knew he was very male: he wanted Carrie and he knew how he wanted her. There was nothing airy-fairy about the way he wanted Carrie: he wanted to touch Carrie, he wanted to see her… He turned on himself, saying, ‘Oh God! Give over!’ There was no light in the drawing-room except that from the fire, which was burning brightly and leaving deep shadows in the corner of the room. He sat on the chintz-covered couch to the side of the fireplace and, leaning his head back, looked about him. From one dim object to another he let his eyes roam, and he saw them all clearly: the Louis Quinze couch between the long windows, the French glass-fronted cabinet in the corner opposite, the sixteenth-century iron-bound chest standing in the alcove, its lid flat against the wall, held there by a pyramid of logs. It was a beautiful room. It was home, the only home he could remember. He was going to miss it. Strangely, he knew at this moment that he'd miss this house as much as his mother would. He also knew that never in his life would he be in a position to own one like it. ‘You couldn't support a rabbit.’ ‘If the moon comes up I doubt we'll see any visitors the night, sir, and it's trying its best over there.’ Martin looked up into the dark sky where now he could see a faint pattern of grey, scudding clouds, then whispered, ‘I don't think it'll last long with this wind, and there's more snow in the air. By God! it's getting colder. And I must say again, Dick, it's very good of you to join me. To tell you the truth, I wasn't looking forward to it. It's a lonely business at any time. I was only saying to young Joe earlier, we really should have two on. Apart from the company it's safer, because one really doesn't know how many of the beggars one has to contend with.’ ‘You're right there, sir. I've said the same to meself, but the way we are fixed…well, we couldn't do much else.’ ‘You're right. You're right, Dick.’ Martin now leant his gun gently against the thick bush of the hedge behind which they were crouched and, putting his hand into the deep pocket of his overcoat, he drew out a flask, unscrewed the silver top, poured out a measure and handed it to Dick Smith, saying, ‘It'll stop the shivers.’ ‘Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.’ Dick did not immediately hand the small cap back to Martin but, taking a clean handkerchief out of the top pocket of  his short, thick coat, he wiped the rim of it, then handed it back, saying again, ‘Thank you, sir.’ Nice chap, Dick; best of the bunch. Strange he had to father two sluts of women. But then he had married one, hadn't he? Any good in that family came from his side. It was a nice gesture to wipe the cup. Yes, yes, indeed he was a good man, Dick. ‘Ssh! what was that?’ They had both slowly turned their heads, which were now very close as they stared to where a grassy bank rose to a narrow stretch of woodland that bordered the house gardens. It wasn't likely that anyone would come that way, for the hen crees were situated in the field just beyond the hedge, and the sheep were there too, having been brought down from the hills after ten of their already small stock had been taken. ‘Likely a branch snapping in the wind, sir.’ ‘Yes, yes; it couldn't be an animal, it was too loud.’ ‘Couldn't be Master Joe out, sir?’ ‘No; he was playing the piano when I left.’ ‘Nice young fellow, Master Joe.’ ‘Yes, Dick; the makings of a good one there, though I don't know how he'll come off in the Forces.’ ‘Oh, it's surprising how the Army toughens the lads, brings out the fibre in ‘em. And as our Mick has often said, there's more to Master Joe than meets the eye.’ ‘True. True.’ As Martin whispered his reply he raised his head slightly above the hedge and peered into the field, where now he could distinctly make out the hen crees and the dark blobs of the sheep. As a thought struck him he dropped on to his hunkers again and whispered quickly, ‘They could come in by the far gate and force their way into the back of the crees: they're only planked.’ ‘I've thought of that, sir; we put wire trips up there ‘safternoon. If they fall over them it'll ring the bell; you know, the old cow-bell that hangs in the shed.’ He paused. ‘Well, we put it up ‘safternoon, sir.’ ‘Good. Good, Dick. It's a splendid idea. So the only way they can get at the crees is through the west field and along the path here.’ ‘Only way, sir. Only way.’ ‘Well, if they come, we'll get them. And by the way, I don't know why we're sitting crouched down here because we could stand up by the spruce there: its shadow is darker than the sky, and we could be more ready for them. No matter how many there are we'll give them a chance to show themselves first, eh? But if they start to run, we'll fire; at the legs, of course. Understood?’ ‘Oh yes, understood, sir.’ They had raised themselves but still remained crouched, and were moving slowly by the hedge towards the tree, when once again Martin's attention was brought round to the strip of woodland, not by a noise this time, but by a strange feeling of impending danger. But it came too late for him to do anything about it, for when he straightened up and turned towards the bank the bullet hit him in the chest and his body seemed to disintegrate and fly in all directions, and he knew that death was on him and that it was something that divided you into a million parts and each fragment screamed as it flung itself into eternity. But as he sank into Dick Smith's trembling arms he made no sound. Even while Dick was lowering Martin to the ground, he had his head turned in the direction of the dark blur standing out against the night and it was only a matter of seconds before he raised himself and his gun towards it. But his finger never pulled the trigger for he, too, felt an explosion in his chest and, as if going into a slow dive, he dropped to the earth, the gun still gripped in his hand, and as he died he heard a voice yelling, ‘Christ! Christ Almighty!’ It was half past ten when Joe placed the iron fire screen in front of the dying embers of the fire and left the drawing-room. The hall light was still on but Martin would put that out later. The house was very quiet. He stopped for a moment and gazed about him. It was strange, but he imagined that at such times as this, when there was only himself and his mother in the house, the building had left its base and was afloat in the air. It was the remains of a childish fancy, created by a story he had read, but it returned to him most vividly at this moment. He again sensed the wrench he was going to feel at leaving this house and never return to it as home… Then, not of a sudden but slowly, there crept through his being the most odd feeling: his stomach began to tremble, as if his bowels had become loose in their casing. No part of his mind said, ‘It's silly to feel like this about leaving the house,’ because he knew that this feeling wasn't in any way connected with his leaving the house. Suddenly he became vitally aware that there was someone in the hall with him. He didn't swing  round but, his thoughts seeming to direct him, he moved slowly, turning a full circle, and he gazed about him, his eyes stretched wide. Had the house actually left the ground, he knew that he couldn't have felt more strange than he did at this moment, or more afraid: there was someone here. Had the poachers been chased and found their way into the house? No, no; it wasn't someone that was here, it was some thing . He was feeling pain now and a great, great sadness. He couldn't bear it. Of a sudden he was running, flying up the stairs. At the top he stopped, brought to a halt by the sight of his mother entering her room. He had the impression that she was fully dressed but told himself that it must be a trick of the light. He felt odd, queer, as if he'd had a bad dream. He walked slowly now towards the room, but as he passed his mother's door he felt forced to stop and knock, not because he wanted to see her particularly, but because there was a great need in him for human company. He wanted to speak to someone and hear their voice speaking to him. There was no answer to his knock, so he knocked again; and then her voice came to him: ‘Wait…wait a moment.’ It seemed as if it were coming from a long distance and he waited for a moment, and the moment went into a full minute, and then slowly he opened the door. She was in bed lying on her back, and as he crossed the room towards her he noticed a number of strange things. Her woollen hat was lying on a chair: she was a tidy woman, over-tidy; there was a place for everything and everything in its place, was her motto. And her outdoor boots were sticking out from under the bed. What drew his eyes down to them was the fact that it was a strange place for them to be. And they were wet. He moved slowly up by the side of the bed, and now he said, ‘Are…are you all right?’ and he saw the bedclothes that she was holding under her chin rise and fall with the movement of her neck before she said, ‘Yes. I… I was asleep.’ At this his lower jaw fell slightly and his head came forward and he said, ‘You were what?’ She did not repeat her last statement but she said, ‘Go…go away, please. I… I want to rest.’ Joe stood staring at her. That strange feeling he had experienced in the hall: had it been repeated on the landing? Was he having hallucinations? No, no. He shook his head at himself. True, he'd had that weird feeling in the hall, but seeing her on the landing a moment ago had been no illusion. His hand shot out now and made an effort to grab the bedclothes from her, but she clutched them tightly against her throat. They stared at each other for a moment in tense silence; then gripping the aide of the bedclothes, he swung them upwards and exposed to his amazed gaze her grey outdoor coat. It was crumpled and wet in parts. Once more he was overcome with a strange feeling, but this he could recognise, for it was made up of unadulterated fear. When she grabbed the clothes and put them around her, saying, ‘I was cold; I… I often sleep in my coat,’ he backed away from her, all the way towards the door; then on the landing, and for no reason that he could give to himself, he turned and ran not towards his bedroom but across the landing, over  the gallery, down the stairs, through the hall to the front door. There he stood leaning against it, his arms outspread, one cheek pressed on to the black wood, with his breath coming in gasps, as if he had just surfaced from drowning. A minute later he had wrenched open the door and was standing on the terrace. The night seemed light, the moon was scudding between white clouds, showing up the white world beyond the drive that had been cleared of snow. He drew in deep, deep breaths of air; then, almost quietly now, he told himself he must find Martin. He must talk to Martin… Perhaps he was going mad. Was he going mad? No, no; he wasn't going mad. It was no illusion: he had pulled the clothes off her, seen her lying in bed in her outer clothes, and those soiled. What was she hiding? Where had she been? He must find Martin — he would be down near the chicken run — he must speak to someone, touch someone's hand, hear someone's voice. He was running again, taking the short cut through the gardens and towards the woodlands, calling now, ‘Martin! Martin! Martin!’ He found Martin, and Mr Smith. Martin was lying on his back, his knees upwards. The moon was shining full on his face — it seemed as if he were staring up at it. He was obviously quite dead. Mr Smith was lying on his side. Joe slipped on the snowy slope as he neared him, and when his hand touched the man's chin above the collar of his rough jacket and felt the sticky wetness on his fingers, he sprang up as if he had been stung by a hornet. ‘Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!’ he was yelling aloud now as he stumbled back towards Martin and then stood looking down at him. He tried to move, but he  couldn't until a voice shouted in his head, ‘Get help. Get help,’ and then he scrambled up the bank and raced like a wild thing, screaming now, ‘Bernard! Mr Swann! Danny! Help! Help! Mary! Mary!’ He had gone through all the Smiths' names by the time he reached the yard, and it was there that Danny Waggett caught hold of him. ‘They're shot!’ Joe screamed. ‘They're shot! Martin and Mr Smith, they're shot, they're shot. Down in the spinney. They're shot! They're shot!’ At two o'clock in the morning the doctor gave him a sedative and he went into a deep sleep, but when he awoke he did not speak to anyone, and the police found great difficulty in questioning him too. If the war wasn't actually forgotten, it was put aside for a few days in the district around Screehaugh. Until the day of the funeral, men and the police searched the grounds and land around hoping to find the murder weapon. Neither Sir Martin Jebeau's gun nor that of his stableman, Richard Smith, had been fired, and both guns were found not a yard from each other. The churned-up snow around the spots where both men had died had not helped the investigations either. The immediate suspects of the murder were a local man and his son; but both these men could not have had stronger alibis, for the father was in hospital after having an operation on his hip bone, while his son had three days previously been called into the Forces. The second suspect was a resident of Consett, but on the night in question his wife had given birth to their first child, and the doctor and the midwife both vouched for the fact that the man had never left the house after he came in from work at half-past five until he went to work the next morning, an hour after he had heard his son first cry. The police thought they were on to something when, following an anonymous ‘phone call, they went to a butcher's shop. The voice on the telephone had informed the police the butcher was in the habit of buying stolen sheep and fowl. The police spent two  days trying to persuade the butcher to give them the name or names of his supplier. When, worn down at last, he mentioned a man who lived as far away as Prudhoe, the polite picked up a young fellow known as Billy the Badger, which apparently had nothing to do with his poaching activities, but was given him because he always wore a white muffler, the ends tucked into his trouser tops, and on Sundays, when he wore his best, which was a black coat and trousers, his pointed face above this ensemble roughly depicted the night creature of the woods. Billy the Badger had much more difficulty in proving his innocence, although he admitted to stealing chickens. Yes, he said, he had raided at Screehaugh, but only for chickens. He swore he had never touched their sheep, and he swore by many Northern oaths that he was in Newcastle up till eleven o'clock on the night of the murders. It took some further persuasion to elicit exactly where he had spent the hours in Newcastle. ‘Pubs,’ he had said briefly at first. When he found this wasn't good enough for the police, the result of speaking the truth being the lesser of two evils, he gave the name of a woman he had visited. What happened when he faced his wife and when the husband of the lady in question, who was in the Forces, heard of her escapade, didn't reach the papers. There was a war on and such emotional family matters were really of no account. The police went on searching. They would find the culprits. But they were hampered by the fact that the stealing of hill sheep at this time was becoming a common occurrence. During the five days between that dreadful night and the day of the funeral, Joe and Ellen Jebeau never looked at each other, nor did a word pass between them. There were no set meals; the whole Smith family was deeply affected and Mary and Helen did only what was absolutely necessary. They cried a lot, and Jesie Smith, appearing in the kitchen more than she had done in recent months, not only cried but wailed, nearly always when Joe was within earshot, and the substance of her wailing was, ‘Left without a breadwinner,’ which nearly always elicited, ‘Oh! Ma, be quiet,’ from Mary. It was an understood thing that Mr Joe, Sir, as he was now — and that was hard to take in — was still in shock, for he walked about like someone in a dream and would stand staring in front of him for minutes on end. Mrs Jebeau, too, appeared shocked. As Mary re-iterated to the police, she'd had a job to wake her up out of a dead sleep that night, and when she did come to she just couldn't take in what had happened: she didn't seem able to speak for ages and she'd had to help her into her clothes. But in private, Mary remarked to Mick that it was funny how that one always seemed to fall on her feet. She had been ready for the road, then Mr Arthur died. And there she had been again, almost packed to make way for Mr Martin's wife, when once again fate had taken a hand, and now she was set nicely. And for good, it would seem, for she'd rule Mr Joe, title or no title. And poor Miss Crosbie. It seemed that she had been knocked silly too. Mary described to Mick how the young girl had stood in the hall, her face cupped  between her palms, and gazed about her, while the tears ran down her face and she kept muttering, ‘Oh Martin! Martin!’ Her mother and father had had to help her down the steps and into the car. The house seemed fated somehow. What did he think…? Did he think Master Joe would go off his head? One part of Joe was telling him he had already gone off his head, but another section kept repeating, ‘It'll soon be over and then you can tell her. Once you've done that you'll be free.’ He still had the numbed feeling on him, and that in itself was frightening, for as yet he could feel no sorrow for either Martin or Mr Smith. He knew that at night, alone in his room, he should be crying, but no tears came; that in itself was strange, for he'd often cried about small things, such as seeing a fox with its leg in a trap, still alive, its eyes begging for release. He had been too afraid and shocked to go near it, and on that particular night he had cried because of his cowardice. Then he had cried one night following a market day in Hexham, for there he had seen two men fighting. It was in a narrow side street and there were only a few people watching. The younger man had hauled his older opponent from the ground and held him up against the wall with one hand while he pummelled his face with the other, and the blood covered his fist. When the sight elicited from one of the bystanders, ‘I know he deserves it, but enough is enough, and after all, he's his father,’ another had answered, ‘Aye, you've said it: he's his father; but then, the lass was his wife.’ He puzzled over that, but he kept remembering the older man's face, and the sadness in it, and the  awful fact that he hadn't retaliated in any way. It was something about the old man's attitude that had made him cry. But here he was in a deep tragedy: the man he had loved — yes, really loved, had been murdered, and he could shed no tears for him… He was dry-eyed at the funeral, and there was a great crowd there. They came to the house on horseback, by car, by bicycle, by farm-cart; but most of them followed the hearse on foot; close friends filled the four cabs. He himself sat in the first cab opposite Martin's two partners, Mr Alex Beecham, the senior partner, and Mr James Holden, now the junior partner. Martin's position in the firm had been between the two. The Smith mourners were all on foot and there were no women present. Dick Smith's hearse followed that in which Martin lay. Joe had insisted on this arrangement despite Mr Beecham's opinion that it wasn't quite seemly. The day was cold, with flurries of snow and people were muffled up to the eyes. But Joe himself didn't feel the cold; when you were numb already, the temperature made little impression on you. In the cemetery he became aware of Mick Smith walking by his side, but he did not acknowledge his presence in any way. Later, when like a waking nightmare, the business was over and he was once again sitting in the cab, Mr Beecham leant towards him and said, ‘If you will excuse us we will be returning straight to Newcastle,’ and paused before adding, ‘Sir Joseph,’which remark drew the young man's attention to him. For the first time a sensation pierced the numbness and it caused Joe's body to jerk and send a message to his brain that created the desire to shout, ‘Don't call me that, because I'm not a sir. I never was and never shall be; you've left the sir in the grave.’ ‘Are you all right?’ ‘Yes, yes.’ The words were clipped. ‘You said you'd be leaving for Newcastle?’ ‘We'd like to make it before dark. With no lighting, the roads can be rather treacherous, you understand, and the weather is seeming to worsen.’ ‘Yes.’ There was a long pause before Joe said, ‘I want to see you about…about business.’ ‘Yes, yes, anytime.’ ‘Tomorrow?’ Mr Beecham's eyebrows moved up slightly, and he said, ‘Yes, if you wish, tomorrow. Say, eleven o'clock?’ ‘Very well.’ Joe's reply was curt and Mr Beecham looked at this young man who, when he had last seen him just a few months ago, had appeared to him to be a schoolboy, immature for his age: but sitting before him now was a young man with no sign of immaturity on his countenance, for he seemed to have aged overnight, as it were. The eyes held a strange expression, and he guessed that even though their gaze was directed towards you their owner's mind was on something entirely different. He had certainly taken the tragedy badly. Doctor Nesbitt had suggested that the shock had perhaps temporarily deranged him, and up till this moment he had agreed with him, but suddenly now the young fellow seemed to know what he was about. Strange how he had given that start when he had addressed him as Sir Joseph. As yet he wasn't used to the title; indeed, he was perhaps the first to have addressed him as such. Even so, it had taken some little effort on his part, for here was this relatively obscure relation who had fallen into an estate, which, although small, was of no mean value, and he had fallen into it by a series of dead men's shoes. And that was putting it plainly. As fate had a habit of doing, it had played what he termed a rather dirty trick for although Martin and his father before him had both found the running of the estate anything but easy as far as money was concerned, this young man would be better off than either of them, for Martin had only within the last year taken out two very large policies on his life, the second when he knew he was going to be married. He wondered if the young man was aware of this. Well, he would be tomorrow morning. By right and custom, he himself and James here should be going back to the house for the reading of the will, but this very new Sir Joseph had made it evident yesterday that he wanted no reading done in the house and that he would let them know when he wanted the matter dealt with. Well, he had now let them know, and tomorrow morning he'd be interested to see what his reactions were. ‘So there it is.’ Mr Beecham placed the last sheet of stiff paper on top of a number of others and raised his gaze again to Joe, who was sitting opposite to him, and continued, ‘There is no obstacle to your inheritance, as I can see. The insurance company, in due course, will settle the policies. These were a  very fortunate investment.’ He coughed, then went on, ‘They won't make you entirely independent, but they will ease any worry about the maintenance of the house and estate. And as time goes by, your staff will likely decrease, for the age limits of call-up will rise. You have two men there under forty, isn't that so?’ ‘Yes… Yes.’ Joe straightened his back against the wooden chair, at the same time reaching out and placing one hand flat on the edge of the long polished table and, looking across at Mr Beecham and James Holden, who sat by his side, he said slowly but firmly, ‘I have no intention of…of living in the house after today. I've volunteered for the Air Force. And should I survive the war, I won't live there even then. But I wish to leave the control of the estate in your hands as sort of legal guardians. You will pay whatever staff have to be kept on to keep the house and grounds in order and…’ ‘But…but —’ Mr Beecham leant forward over the desk now, his hand on the blotter in line with that of Joe's, and he said two words: ‘Your mother?’ Joe now withdrew his hand from the desk and, rising to his feet, he looked down on to the upturned faces of the two men and said, ‘My mother may remain in the house as long as she wishes, but the running of it, the accounts and such, I wish to leave in your control. Mary Smith will act as housekeeper and she will submit all bills to you.’ He now watched both men rise simultaneously to their feet, and it was James Holden who, turning to his partner, said almost in a whisper, ‘Her…her allowance?’ On this Mr Beecham, nodding now, spoke in a small voice: ‘We will continue her allowance?’ ‘No.’ ‘No?’ ‘I said no. She can live in the house under those conditions or go. It's up to her.’ There was silence between the three of them for a moment as they returned each other 's stare; then Joe said, ‘If you don't wish to act for me I can make other arrangements.’ Mr Beecham's voice was stiff now as he replied, ‘We have always acted for the house and I shall be happy to continue doing so. But, nevertheless, I must say that I find your orders rather disconcerting.’ Again there was silence between them, but as Mr Beecham stared at this young man, he remembered Martin hinting that his aunt kept the young boy on a tight rein; and he also went further back and recalled Arthur's confidence and how he had once described his sister-in-law as a frantic leech. Perhaps the young man had something on his side after all. But his measures were definitely drastic, smacking somewhat of retaliation. ‘Good-day and thank you. One thing more, when you write to me, would you be kind enough not to use the…the title. In fact, I wish to disclaim it.’ The two older men made no reply to this, and neither of them moved towards the door to open it; nor did they say ‘Good-day…’ Joe walked out of the offices into the thick driving snow. The fact that he turned his collar up against the seeping cold indicated that his numbness had been penetrated, yet he was unaware of it. He was well on his way to the station when he paused and looked up towards a building, and he saw in his mind's eye Carrie running up the steps, and he recalled her voice saying, ‘Oh! why must you keep on about that.’ The word ‘that’ to which she was referring was love. How long ago was it? Days or years? Had he ever loved anybody? Yes, he had loved Martin and Harry and his Uncle Arthur. He seemed to love people more when they were dead. But no, he had indeed loved them when they were alive. But there was nobody left to love now, and that was a good thing. Never, never again in his life would he say he loved anybody, for love was a destroyer, love was a madness that turned people into fiends and devils. He was going back now to confront one, one who supposedly did what she did out of love, and strangely he was no longer afraid. When your whole being was overflowing with loathing and hate there was no room for fear. He said to Mary, ‘Where is she?’ not, ‘Where is my mother?’ ‘Up in her room, Mr Joe…’ Mary was finding it difficult to change her way of addressing this new master. She had never yet addressed him as Sir Joseph, because somehow he didn't look like a sir; he didn't, in her eyes, fit the title; he was too young. Yet she had to admit he had changed over the last few days. By! he had that, and in more ways than one. She didn't like to own up to the fact that she now stood a little in awe of him, and she had never felt like that with either Mr Martin or his father before him because, in their own ways, they had both been free and easy. Leaving Mary staring after him, Joe ran up the stairs, crossed the gallery, and went straight to his  mother's bedroom. He didn't knock, but paused for a moment before opening the door. She was sitting by the window at a little table she used as a writing desk, and she jerked round as he entered the room, but she didn't rise. Neither did he move from where he was standing, just inside the door, for almost a minute; and when he did, he came quickly to the side of the table and stood within an arm's length of her. Again they looked at each other in silence, and then he said very slowly, ‘I've been to see Beecham and Holden. I've made arrangements with them how the estate is to be run. You, Mother, may stay or go, but you'll have no control of any of the affairs, either outside or inside the house. You can eat free and sleep free, but that's as far as your privileges will extend, ever. Do you understand?’ He watched her mouth fall open, then he saw her upper lip twitch and her eyelids flutter; then she muttered, ‘No! no! you can't do it.’ Her words were scarcely audible. ‘I've done it… Will you stay?’ He bent towards her now. ‘You'll have plenty of company: three dead men and a woman.’ They were staring into each other 's eyes now, both mouths agape. ‘You fixed the car, didn't you; Vanessa Southall's car? You didn't expect Uncle to be in it… And then Martin was going to marry, wasn't he?’ His voice was no more than a faint whisper now but it was as if his words were spraying vitriol on her face, because she tossed her head from side to side as if throwing off the spray. ‘You couldn't bear the thought, could you, of that girl, that nice young girl, being mistress  here? you told yourself it was for me, all for me.’ ‘It was, it was.’ Her lips mouthed the words but no real sound came from them. ‘You thought he was on his own, didn't you? You didn't count on Dick being so conscientious that he wouldn't let Martin watch alone.’ He put out his hand towards her now but didn't touch her, saying, ‘Don't faint; it won't help you any because I'll only revive you with a jug of cold water and make you listen to the finish. ‘Where have you hidden the gun? Where have you put it, eh? I know every gun in that room. I used to help Martin clean them. But the police never thought to ask if there was one missing, because the lady of the house was fast asleep in bed, wasn't she? And there was only the maidservant and me. They could even have suspected me had they not found the two sets of footprints in the soft snow right up to the very hedge where Martin was hiding. The poachers had already been and got away with their spoils; or when they heard the shots, they made off. We'll never know, will we? But you know something, Mother?’ His face was hanging over hers now. ‘I could commit murder at this very minute. I have a great urge to throttle you, but that would prove I'd inherited your madness and I want no trait of you to show in me, ever. Ever!’ He shouted the last word; then his voice dropping again, he said, ‘The very smell of you nauseates me; you stink of death.’ Now he drew himself upwards and stepped back from her, and it seemed to give her space to breathe, for she drew air into her lungs and for the first time she spoke, almost whimpering now: ‘I… I didn't do it. It's…it's you who are mad. And…and you can't leave me like this, with nothing… My allowance.’ ‘You have no allowance. I've told you the terms: you are bed and board, as the saying goes, nothing more. And let me tell you this: should you in any way try to get in touch with me, even go to the partners and ask for my whereabouts, I swear before God —‘He now raised his hand in a dramatic fashion and paused before he added, ‘See, I'm taking an oath. I swear before God that I'll expose you for what you are: a four times murderess.’ He took another step backwards and stared at her for a long moment before saying, ‘This is the last time I'll ever look on you willingly.’ ‘Joe! Joe!’ Her voice was cracked, coming like a broken note from a rusty instrument; and again she appealed to him as she watched him move towards the bedroom door. ‘Come…come back a minute. Oh Joe. Joe.’ He stopped with the door handle in his hand and quietly said, ‘Yes, I'll come back some day when you are gone and I'll find where you've hidden the gun, for you wouldn't have dared take it outside this room, would you? And this —’ he moved his arm slowly to the side as he was about to add, ‘This is going to be your grave,’but he stopped, for two reasons; the words sounded melodramatic, like those that might be used in an amateur play, and this was no amateur play; the second reason was that he felt sick. He Was stumbling as he walked across the landing. There was no sound from behind now, and he leant against the bannisters for a moment, his upper body swaying over them, and his stomach began to heave. She was insane. His mother was insane, yet she  looked so normal, frail and normal. But she really was insane, mad. And he was her son, he was the son of a mad woman. What was in her was in him. No! No! He was running down the stairs. Without stopping in the hall to put on an outer coat, he wrenched open the front door, ran over the terrace and down the steps. It was as he dashed along the drive that Mick Smith saw him. Mick was walking slowly, a haversack and gas mask hanging from his shoulder. He was on his way back to Newcastle, but when he saw Joe racing across the field that bordered part of the drive, he paused a moment before deciding to follow him. He didn't run but hurried in the same direction, and he kept him in view until Joe disappeared into the belt of woodland. When he himself entered it he couldn't see him ahead or on either side, although in most places the bracken and undergrowth was flat. It was as he was about to emerge from the far end of the wood that the figure on the ground brought him to a standstill. Putting down his gas mask and haversack at the side of a tree, he walked slowly forward; then dropping on to one knee, he placed his hand on Joe's shoulder, and the contact brought the younger man round with a start. ‘What is it, lad?’ ‘Oh, Mick! Mick!’ It was an agonised cry. And then he was lying face downwards again, his knuckles pressed into his mouth, trying to smother the fearful sounds that were erupting from his being. When the tears sprang from his eyes and nose and his body shook as with an ague, Mick put his arms about him and, pulling him round, cradled him as he would a child, saying, ‘There! There! Let it up, an' out. It's over. It's over. It's over. What's done's done; nobody can bring them back.’ How long he lay against Mick he didn't know; he only knew that between the sounds he had been emitting and the wash of tears that seemed to have drained him dry, a voice within him had kept repeating: ‘She killed your father, Mick; she killed your father. My mother killed your father.’ ‘I'm sorry,’ was what he said, however, apologising for his tears. ‘Nothing to be sorry for; it's the best thing that could have happened. You'd likely have been sorry if you hadn't, 'cos you've been on the verge of snapping. I've seen that. I wanted to talk to you, but I couldn't get through to you somehow… Anyway, what are you going to do now? Have you thought?’ Joe had hitched himself into a sitting position against the bole of a tree, and as he wiped his face he answered, ‘I'm… I'm leaving today; I've joined up.’ ‘Oh.’ Mick shook his head. ‘Oh, well. What you in?’ Joe looked at the blue overcoat Mick was wearing and said, ‘Same as you, the RAF.’ ‘Flying?’ ‘Signals — wireless-mechanic.’ ‘It's a tough life, mind.’ ‘I'll survive.’ ‘Yes, of course you will.’ Mick nodded his head reassuringly. Then glancing at his watch, he said, ‘Come on, get up out of that; I've got to be away, my train goes at four o'clock.’ Joe got to his feet and he stood with his head bent as Mick retrieved his things; then slowly he joined him, and together they walked back through  the wood, silent now, until they reached the drive There, holding out his hand, Mick said, ‘You'll be all right now. And after all, perhaps joining up was the best thing you could do; you'll be among people. And who knows, but we might bump into each other…eh? Good…goodbye, Joe.’ ‘Goodbye, Mick. And thanks. Not only for now, but for everything; all the help you've always been to me.’ Mick stared at him for a moment, then again he said, ‘Goodbye.’ And Joe answered ‘Goodbye’, and they parted. As Joe walked away he felt that he had said goodbye to the last phase of his youth, and that his storm of weeping had swept him into manhood and away from all connection with the woman back in that room. Yet he felt like someone entering a foreign country without knowing anything about the language."
FIC FIC-G01-019 9.15 "58 The shutters were still closed, the door firmly locked. It would be another two hours before Les Gourmets opened for business. Inside the restaurant the tables were bare but for cloths, all immaculately clean. The staff wouldn't arrive to set them for a while yet. Out in the kitchen preparations were already taking place in readiness for the lunch-time trade. The restaurant always did well at lunch-times, situated as it was in Shepherd Market. It was one of five such establishments owned by Ray Plummer. Now he sat at one of the tables, cradling a glass of white wine in one hand. With the other he gently stroked his hair. There were five other men with him. They too had drinks. Plummer put down his glass and reached into his inside pocket for the monogrammed cigarette case. He took one and lit it, looking round at his companions. ‘Same voice as the other night, Ray?’ said John Hitch, flicking his long blond hair over his shoulders. Plummer nodded. ‘And I still couldn't pin the bastard down,’ he complained. ‘He says the shipment's coming in by boat?’ Terry Morton said. ‘The Sandhopper , it's called,’ Plummer told him. He repeated the other details about the shipment of cocaine, as relayed to him by the mysterious informant the previous night. He sat back when he'd finished and sipped his wine. ‘Could it be a set up?’ Joe Perry wanted to know. Perry was a thick-set, bull-necked man who looked as if he'd been eased into his suit with a shoe-horn. The material stretched so tightly across his shoulder blades it threatened to rip. His face was smooth, almost feminine; it looked as if it had never felt the touch of a razor. Plummer shrugged. ‘It could be,’ he said. ‘It could also be bollocks, couldn't it?’ Morton interjected. ‘I mean, there might not even be a shipment of coke.’ ‘Then why bother phoning?’ asked Adrian McCann, rubbing a hand over his close-cropped hair. Over his ears it was completely shaved. ‘It's a bit fucking elaborate, isn't it?’ ‘That's what I said,’ Plummer agreed. He turned to Hitch. ‘You heard the geezer the other night, John; he didn't sound like he was joking, did he?’ Hitch shook his head. ‘I agree with Joe,’ he added. ‘It could be a set-up.’ ‘But by who?’ Plummer wanted to know, a note of exasperation in his voice. ‘We know it's not another organisation in London, especially not Ralph Connelly's firm.’ ‘Could it be somebody working for Connelly with an axe to grind?’ asked Martin Bates, running his finger around the rim of his glass. Bates was in his early twenties, one of Plummer's youngest employees. Plummer shrugged. ‘Who knows? The point is, do we go with it or not? Do we assume there is a shipment? And, if there is, do we knock it over?’ ‘Are you asking for votes, boss?’ Hitch said, laughing. The other men laughed too. Plummer didn't see the  joke and glanced irritably at Hitch, waiting until they calmed down. ‘Right, let's assume there is a shipment of coke,’ he continued. ‘Let's say that phone call was kosher. The day after next the shipment is meant to be arriving,if the information's right. If it is right then the coke is hidden among a load of coffee beans. Now the question is, if this is a set-up, we're going to get hit when we try to take the lorry they're transferring the shit to. How do we get round that ?’ ‘Take out the lorry first?’ offered Joe Perry. ‘No,’ Hitch said, smiling. ‘We hit it before they even take it off the boat.’ Even Plummer smiled. ‘Hijack the fucking boat,’ Hitch continued. ‘Unload it somewhere else down the river. We have our own lorry waiting. Unload it, pack it away and piss off.’ Plummer slapped him on the shoulder. ‘That's what we'll do,’ he said. ‘Take the shipment while it's still on the river.’ ‘Like pirates,’ chuckled Morton. The other men laughed. ‘Ray, there are some other things to consider,’ offered McCann. ‘Once we've hit Connelly's shipment, he ain't going to be too happy.’ ‘I wouldn't be if I'd just lost twenty million,’ Plummer said humourlessly. ‘What are you getting at? You reckon he might come looking for bother?’ ‘Wouldn't you?’ McCann said. ‘He's right, Ray,’ Hitch interjected. ‘A fucking gang war is the last thing we want.’ ‘What am I, stupid?’ Plummer said. ‘There's no need for Connelly to know who turned him over. If it's done properly, and I'm not talking about fucking balaclavas and funny accents, there's no reason why he should know  who hit him.’ He looked at Hitch. ‘I'm leaving that side of it to you, John. Like I said, you got about thirty-six hours.’ Hitch nodded. ‘If the worst comes to the worst and he does find out, what then?’ Perry wanted to know. ‘A gang war would be as damaging to Connelly as it would to us. He won't want it,’ Plummer said with assurance. ‘But if he does , he can't win. We're stronger and, for twenty million, I'm bloody sure we're going to be better equipped. Connelly will realise that. He's not stupid.’ ‘So we go with it, then?’ Hitch echoed. Plummer nodded. He reached across and touched Hitch's arm. ‘John, I want Jim Scott to drive one of the cars,’ he said quietly. Hitch looked puzzled. ‘Scott? He runs one of your clubs, doesn't he? I wouldn't have thought he was the right bloke for this kind of operation,’ Hitch said. ‘I want him involved,’ Plummer said, his eyes never leaving Hitch. ‘He knows how to handle himself. He'll be all right.’ ‘I'm sure he will. I just don't know why you want him in on it.’ ‘I've got my reasons,’ Plummer said. Hitch shrugged. ‘I'm sure you have,’ he said. ‘Okay, I'll tell him. If you want him in, that's fair enough, Ray. You're the boss.’ Plummer smiled. ‘Yeah, I am .’"
FIC FIC-H85-002 7.97 "Chapter Four ‘And of course, he does look like Place,’ Lane admitted ruefully. ‘Strong general resemblance. Not twins by any means, but close enough. And you can't blame him for being frightened. I frighten myself sometimes. He and John Coffin were standing in Maryon Park Gardens. Roxie Farmer was still sitting in the police car, looking out at them with an expressionless face. She wore a great deal of make-up at all times, but that day, perhaps just as primitive man might have painted his face as a protection, she was garnished with particularly bright eye colours and lipstick, so that it was a little garish mask staring at the two policemen. She saw the Chief Superintendent looking at her and turned her head away. ‘Let's have a word with Roxie,’ Coffin started to stroll towards the car. ‘See what she can tell us. She used to be quite a truthful girl. In her own way.’ ‘You know her?’ Lane was surprised. ‘From the past. She was a case once herself, poor Roxie. Before your time. ‘What sort of case?’ They call them battered babies now, I don't think we did then. But battered she was, the poor kid, and by her own father. Nearly killed her. They were a violent family. And Terry was her kid brother. For  some reason he didn't get the kicks, but he certainly saw it happen.’ ‘It must have made an impression on you, that case,’ observed the Inspector drily. ‘I remembered the child's name: Roxie. It's an unusual one round here. We used to joke that she was named after a local cinema. Anyway, I was interested enough in Roxie to look the case up again… So let's go and talk to her now.’ ‘You won't get any more out of her, even if she remembers you.’ ‘She won't remember me or the episode. She was only a baby.’ Or so he hoped. Be all there deep inside, though, he was sure of that as truth. He got into the car beside her. ‘Hello, Roxie, you won't remember me, but we met once.’ She stared silently, nothing welcoming in her face. ‘You knew that wasn't your brother in that house. Why did you let us believe it could be?’ Roxie shrugged. ‘Yes, silly question. You wouldn't help us if you could, would you? But did you help him? Your brother had a piece of paper in his pocket with Billy Egan's hiding place on it. That's what I think it is. And from the forensics, I believe Egan wrote it himself, perhaps to remember the address, and the paper somehow came into the hands of your brother so he knew where Egan was. Did you give it to him?’ Roxie shook her head silently. ‘Someone did. Your brother is in a dangerous state. A bit over the edge. You know that, don't you, Roxie. And I think you know where he is. ‘I said.’ Her voice was gruff. ‘You said a tunnel by the pier. I think you could be much more precise if you wanted.’ He tapped the driver on the shoulder. ‘Let's take a drive around and you shall tell me when we get warm. Like a child's game. Cold, warm, warmer, and hot.’ He motioned to Inspector Lane, who got in beside him. There was already a woman detective in the car, acting as driver. Roxie drew herself into the corner as if she wanted to get as far away from them as she could. ‘I don't want to see him.’ ‘You won't have to. ‘And I don't want him to see me. ‘I can't promise anything. But I'll do my best. ‘Come on now, Roxie,’ said the sergeant from the front seat. ‘Tell me which way to go.’ She was driving efficiently towards Greenwich, just approaching the park. ‘You'll find him soon enough. I gave you what help I could. Look underground, look near the pier, like I said. By the Cutty Sark. And then look out.’ ‘What do you mean, Roxie?’ Coffin took her up sharply. In a harsh voice, Roxie said, ‘He's got a gun.’ ‘I see.’ Coffin looked towards Paul Lane, who shook his head. No, his men were not armed. ‘There's worse than that.’ Roxie paused. ‘I think he's got some explosive on him, too.’ Peter and Nona had their backs against a wall, they were facing the man who seemed to inhabit the tunnel. Live there did not seem to be quite the word for someone whose residence there appeared so transient. He had a sleeping-bag, a torch propped up on two slabs of stone, and a couple of carrier bags. An overnight case had been placed carefully on a sheet of newspaper. He also had a gun. Nona felt the wall pressing into her back. Peter reached out and took her hand. This wasn't going right. He was The Master, but no one would know it. This wasn't how it should be. Nona knew it too, he could see in her face. ‘Let her go,’ said the man. ‘Move a step apart. I don't want you two to be close to each other.’ He was a short man, still clinging on to youth in his clothes and the cut of his hair. His pale grey suit and suede jacket were stylish, even if now creased and grubby. He had managed to shave somehow. Peter did not move. The man waved the gun in his face. ‘You don't know me, remember that. And you won't remember me when I'm away. I'm just a man. Call me that.’ ‘Do what he says,’ whispered Nona, who was frightened. She knew that there were several personal matters about her that could arouse the man, and that it was better to be cautious. It was hateful to have to be like that, and usually she did not allow herself to think on those lines, but it was there and had to be recognized as a factor. Probably Peter did not see it. Peter muttered something resentful under his breath, but did as she asked. Just one small pace. He was not particularly frightened himself, more excited and interested than alarmed, but he did not want to endanger Nona. He sensed already that her position was more vulnerable than his own. He could see it  in the man's eyes and the manner in which his gaze lingered on Nona. He could understand it. There was a lot about Nona that made her very vulnerable indeed, and which she seemed unaware of. In a way, this irked him and always had done. He felt she should know. Even while he admired Nona and loved her, there were times he wanted to say: ‘Look, Nona, there is this thing you have to take into account between us.’ But he had not yet mastered a way of putting it into words. He reached out and took her hand. At this moment it was for him to protect her, and he must find a way to do it. Somehow the chap, who had plainly gone over the top, he could understand that, must be convinced they were no threat to him. He tried. ‘We won't say anything. We'll say we only came exploring. Just let us out. It's nothing to do with us, you being here.’ Be a troglodyte if you want to be, he thought. Stay as long as you like. Die here. See if I care. He did not let himself think how this man had killed Billy Egan, nor the ferocity he had shown. He could understand, even appreciate, the violence, but he did not want it turned against himself and Nona. Not that way. ‘Sit down.’ Nona looked down at her clean jeans and pretty shirt, then she slid on to the floor, ignoring a patch of dirt. Reluctantly Peter sat down beside her. ‘Don't touch,’ said the man again. ‘Keep well apart.’ Peter moved about an inch. The man, all right, call him ‘the man’, seemed satisfied. He moved back himself and leaned against the wall, studying them. He picked the stub of a half-smoked cigarette out of his pocket and lit it. He smoked it deliberately in slow puffs, giving Peter time to consider their situation. Their captor, if that was what he was, stood between them and the way out. They were probably strong enough if they acted as a team to push him aside, but he had the gun. If it was loaded. Somehow, from the way he handled it, Peter thought it was loaded. He bent down to stare at the floor. He could sense that the man was more afraid and taut than he was himself. He could pick up the fear. Smell it almost, although the man, a natty dresser by Peter's standards, had loaded himself with aftershave. He tried again. ‘If you let us out, we'll just walk away.’ The man dropped the tiny fraction of the cigarette that he could not smoke to the ground, letting the last acrid smoulder of it rise in the air. Nona coughed. ‘Shut up. I'm thinking.’ Nona said, politely and carefully, ‘I think you are being silly. You haven't harmed us. Let us go now and there will be no trouble for you. Why should there be?’ In defiance of the man, Peter reached out and took her hand, pressing it, trying to tell her to keep quiet. She was not showing her usual intelligence. ‘The chap's not resting here,’ Peter wanted to say to her, ‘he's hiding. And if he's hiding, then he must have good reason for it.’ But it was safer if Nona did not go on and dig this out of him. She might suspect the exact position; with her knowledge, she probably did, but much better not to say. There were rules, he willed her, follow them. She spoke. ‘Unless you are already in trouble. ‘I told you to shut up.’ For once Peter agreed with him. ‘Don't go on, Nona.’ ‘We've been out a long while already. My parents will wonder where I am.’ If they're at home, thought Peter. ‘It's only just after midday. We never had our picnic.’ ‘No.’ She looked very white, and somehow surprised, as if her precious youth had never met such a threat before. ‘Let's have it now.’ ‘I dropped the bag by the door. ‘I know you did.’ Of course he knew. He was sitting looking a But she was relaxing a little. He reached out with his foot to drag the lunch bag towards him. Sarah would be surprised to know what had happened to her picnic. ‘You can forget that,’ said the man. ‘Just sit still.’ Peter still quietly edged his right foot forward. ‘Stay where you are.’ He drew back his foot. To his surprise, the man went over and kicked the bag towards him. ‘Go on. Eat it if you like.’ Good thing or bad thing? Bad, probably. It meant they were here for some time. When things went wrong in this kind of game, they went very wrong. He pressed his back against the stone wall and stretched out his hand for some food. Nona shook her head before he had a chance to offer her anything. He knew that was the wrong way to be, she ought to try to eat. It was a gesture of strength to the man who held them prisoner, if nothing else. She was one of those who, in time of crisis, cannot eat. He himself could always eat; he would have made a good soldier. He bit into one of Sarah's ham and cucumber sandwiches; his taste buds appreciated them. He took another one. Although not given to dramatic expressions, he found himself thinking: End of Act One. Down by the Cutty Sark, the police search had begun again. Now they knew where they were going. In an office on the pier Coffin and Lane had maps spread out in front of them. The room was full of policemen, as well as the Chief Superintendent and the Inspector, there was the officer in charge of the search and a sergeant. The woman detective had gone off with Roxie Farmer to give her a cup of tea and sit in her house keeping an eye on her. ‘That's the tunnel.’ Coffin pointed to a line on the map, running from the river to the park. It even had a name, he could just make out the tiny print. ‘Victory Tunnel. Which victory would that be?’ ‘Trafalgar, I should think,’ said the pier official. He was an elderly man who had worked on the river all his life and regarded his present job as something of a rest on the way to full retirement. But he loved the river which was his life. His name, Waters, befitted him. ‘Or even the Armada. It's all old stuff round here. ‘Usable still, is it?’ ‘We keep everything in good order. But you won't  get in it easily now the tide's up. Wait until it goes down and you can walk in without getting your feet wet.’ ‘Can't we approach by boat?’ ‘We'll do that anyway, but it's still better to have the tide with you.’ He had a proper respect for the river as all must who work on her. He suspected Coffin of lacking it. ‘I'd like to go now.’ It was an order. The atmosphere in the tunnel had deteriorated in the last two hours as the cigarette smoke had grown thicker. Unless their captor had a secret supply of them, Peter reckoned he would be out of smokes before they moved. They would be moving, and he pondered about that move, thinking about the gun. He had no idea what the time was. He did not have a watch, the only timepiece in the family was an aged alarm clock sitting on the kitchen shelf. Nona had a watch with a pretty red face, but she was sitting with her hands in her lap with the watch hidden. He knew better than to ask her the time; she was edgy enough as it was. So was Their Captor. That was his official title now in Peter's mind. That made him both easier to think about (for were there not rules about Captors? Rules of War) and infinitely more dangerous. ‘Let her go,’ he said suddenly and loudly, more loudly than he had meant. ‘Let her go off and I'll stay. Nona raised her head and looked at Peter hopefully. ‘I wouldn't leave you.’ He ignored this as valiant but untrue. She would certainly go if she got the chance, and he would not blame her. ‘Let her go,’ he repeated. ‘We'll all move together, when we go,’ said the man. He was sitting on the ground near his packages over which he kept a protective, hostile arm, as if he did not want anything of his touched. ‘I'll go first, then you after me. ‘When?’ ‘When it's dark and the time is right. Do you think I've been staying here for the good of my health? I'm waiting for the tide.’ It was the longest sentence he had said since they got there. There had been occasional mutterings to himself over his cigarettes, but nothing spoken to them. This was almost a conversation, and not a fuck or a shit in it. There had been quite a lot of those in the sentences directed at himself. ‘Why can't we go first?’ ‘Because I say not.’ And he looked at his gun. ‘I have the right to say. And who gave me that Right?’ For the first time, Peter felt fear. And also a tremendous sense of excitement. This is it, he thought, this is how it should be. Power is crackling through me. Irene Pitt had her lunch with Christopher, saw that he was deeply preoccupied with his election chances, not thinking about her at all, and wondered if she was going to enjoy being married to a politician. ‘Oh, come on, now. There may not be a General Election.’ ‘Got to be,’ he said gloomily. ‘He'll have to go. If not now, then soon.’ ‘He wouldn't dare do it.’ ‘Things happen. He's not a lucky PM. He's got trouble.’ Nothing like President Carter's, of course, but sufficient. No, it really was not going to be much fun being married to a politician. Then she caught Chris's eyes, and yes, it was, after all. You could change your mind three times in as many seconds, and that was the exhausting thing about being in love. Age didn't seem to make any difference. After their lunch (so called, but not much was eaten), she went shopping, met a friend to discuss future work plans and finally went home. Edward appeared at the door of his study as soon as he heard her key in the door. ‘Where's Nona?’ ‘Out. She was going on a picnic.’ ‘It's time she was back.’ ‘It's not late.’ She looked at the wall clock. It was a household with a number of clocks, all of them accurate. ‘Late enough.’ ‘Oh, come on.’ Edward said angrily: ‘The sooner this divorce is over and done with, the better.’ ‘Eddy, why are you like this suddenly? You never were in New York. You were happy enough about it. After all. you had always got…’ She did not utter  what he had always got. But he had always had Someone. ‘I wish we had never come back to this house. It might, indeed, have been better. The river police provided a boat, an escort and much expert advice. They showed signs of wanting to take the whole operation over, but Coffin, backed up by his Inspector, would have none of it. They piled into the motor launch. ‘We will make a fair noise, let him know we are coming,’ commented Lane. ‘Wouldn't it be better to sneak up quietly? By rowing.’ ‘No. I don't mind if he hears us coming. See what he does.’ ‘We can shout if you like,’ said the man piloting the launch agreeably. ‘No. No voices. Just the sound of the launch's engine.’ ‘Right you are.’ They chugged down river from the pier towards the entrance to the tunnel. The tide, as predicted, covered the little path by which Peter and Nona had arrived, and lapped at the wooden door. A plastic bag floated in the water. ‘Someone round here shops at Harrods,’ said Coffin. ‘And I don't think it's Terry Place.’ He fished out the bag to examine it. ‘Had chocolates in it. There's still one in it, stuck to the bottom. Looks quite fresh.’ He added, thoughtfully, ‘Wonder if there's anyone inside with him?’ That made a difference. They heard the engine of the motor launch inside the tunnel. It was clearly audible in the silence. No one had said anything for a long time. ‘I can hear an engine.’ Nona scrambled to her feet. She opened her mouth to shout. Terry Place clamped his hand over her mouth, stifling her cries. ‘Shut up, you bitch.’ Nona bit his hand in a fury of frustration and fear. He hit at her face with the gun, but she jerked her head back. Peter lunged forward to protect Nona, but the gun was stuck in Nona's neck. ‘Please,’ whispered Nona, her eyes on Peter. ‘Move another inch and she'll have it.’ ‘That won't do you any good if it's escape you're looking for.’ But Peter drew back. ‘I'll kill myself before I let myself be taken in.’ ‘You won't kill yourself,’ said Peter. ‘I know you. You mind how you look. I've seen a dead man, a man who killed himself, and he looked terrible. He soiled his clothes so he stank, and his face was all swollen and black. You wouldn't like to look like that.’ ‘Don't,’ said Nona. Outside in the launch a conference was going on. ‘Like to know who's in there with him.’ Coffin was still holding the bag which had held chocolates. ‘Some wretched tourists, I suppose. Wonder how they got there?’ ‘Same way as he did,’ said the river policeman. ‘You can walk when the tide's right. If he's there, of course.’ ‘I think he is,’ Roxie had thought so, and Coffin believed she understood her brother. Didn't like him, feared him even, but knew the way his mind worked. ‘We're sure there's no way out the other end?’ ‘There was once,’ said Lane. ‘According to the map. Came out just by the Old Observatory. Near the Meridian. But the chap in the office says a bomb went down there in the war and there was a landfall. The tunnel is blocked. He was clear on that. You heard him.’ ‘He's caught like a rat in a trap, then.’ They stayed quietly in the launch, waiting and listening. Everything was still. At home, in Church Row, Nona's parents were just beginning to get worried about her. Sarah had hardly thought about her brother yet, but she did wonder when he missed his tea. No Fleming ever missed his tea, it was the main meal of the day, and Sarah was very good at producing tasty dishes like Toad in the Hole and homemade deep apple pie. She was an enterprising cook, as she was in all things, and fed her family well. All the same, she was surprised when Edward and Irene Pitt turned up on her doorstep. ‘No,’ she said. ‘I don't know where they are. Just out. They are grown up, you know. I didn't expect Pete home any special time.’ Privately, she thought that Irene and Edward must be living in the past. You didn't expect people to clock in these days. But in the end she agreed to go with the Pitts to the local police station to express concern about the absentees. She refused to regard them as missing. It meant taking Weenie and Co., who had to be made tidy and neat, so it was some time before their caravan set forth. Weenie and the others piled into Edward's car with relish. An outing. What luck. One had to hope, Sarah thought, that they wouldn't be sick. On the river, another police launch had arrived to complement the first one. They were in radio contact with their base. ‘He's in there,’ said Coffin. He had decided to make a move. ‘Let's give him a shout.’ ‘Terry! Terry Place, we know it's you. Open up and come out.’ The noise echoed over the water which seemed to suck up the sound. They tried again. You didn't expect an answer straight away. Suddenly, from inside the tunnel, they heard first a shot and then a scream. There was no mistaking the sex of the screamer. ‘Who's the girl?’ said Coffin. For once communication of information was brisk and free, all channels seemed to be open and listening to each other. Another launch from the river police arrived to help keep watch on the mouth of the tunnel. More policemen took up station on the river walk. A cordon was thrown round the area. For the moment they were sitting and waiting. From the local police came the story of the missing girl and boy. As soon as he heard the story, John Coffin had himself taken back to the police centre dealing with the case. The Pitts were glad to see someone they knew. Irene Pitt was shown the plastic bag which had once  White and anxious, she said: Yes, she had given that bag to her daughter, and it had contained such chocolates. The young policeman from Bromley reported that he had seen a young couple whose description matched the wanted pair and they had gone towards the pier. ‘I watched because they were a striking couple. He had red hair and she was beautiful. Very striking. They went down a flight of steps on the river walk. No, I didn't see any more. Couldn't from where I was. They were out of view.’ Sarah Fleming answered the few questions that came her way with concise intelligence. John Coffin questioned her himself. Yes, it sounded like Peter. He did have red hair and he had certainly been interested in the whole area down by the river walk. It was something of an obsession with him. No, she didn't know Terry Place and she would be surprised if Peter did. He only liked people of his own generation. Bright kid, Coffin thought. What's she keeping back? He sensed there was something. ‘We'll arrange a car home for you and that lot,’ he said, giving her a smile and Weenie (who was stamping on his foot) a severe look. ‘Try not to worry.’ She was surprised how unhappy and anxious she felt. It was almost a pleasure to deal with a tantrum from Weenie, and a positive relief to be sent home in a police car. She knew that the Pitts were going to stay with the police, go down to the river to wait if the Chief Superintendent let them, but she did not want to. You had to trust Peter. She did trust Peter. ‘Now we know who is in there with Place. He's got  the girl, Nona, and the lad. The girl is frightened but alive. About the boy we don't know.’ ‘We heard a shot,’ said Lane. ‘He could be hurt. Or even dead.’ ‘That's looking on the black side.’ ‘We can get bugs fastened to the door. They'll pick up anything inside. That way we will know who is in there and where.’ ‘And how long to get them fixed?’ The man shrugged. ‘Depends.’ Coffin looked across the water. ‘I don't think we've got much time.’ Inside the tunnel, Peter said to Terry Place: ‘That wasn't very clever, what you did just now, firing the gun. Now they know you're inside. ‘They knew that anyway.’ ‘You could have kept them guessing. Peter felt immensely stronger than Place, and in charge. ‘And now they know you are frightened as well.’ After a period of silence from outside, a voice now hailed Place, told him to come out and give himself up. By some freak of the acoustics his name seemed to echo round and round the chamber. Place, Place, Place. The three of them had come back down the tunnel to the entrance, with the man pushing Nona in front of him as a hostage. Nona whispered to Peter: ‘What's going to happen?’ ‘I don't know.’ From the river the disembodied voice said: ‘Let the girl go. Send her out. Place took no action, but the other two could see he was listening. The voice started again: ‘Send her out before we come in, and we won't hurt you.’ ‘Why don't you do it?’ Peter had the question ready. ‘It would be better.’ Once again the voice outside spoke: ‘Open up, Place.’ ‘Let her go,’ said Peter, ‘and I'll stay. You've still got me.’ ‘No.’ Place moved forward quickly. He grabbed Nona by the waist, held her against him, with the gun pressed to her neck. ‘She stays, you go.’ ‘I won't.’ Give in to this man and you're lost, Peter thought. He's mad, gone over the top. ‘Get on with it.’ Nona looked at Peter with fear in her eyes. ‘Please. Do what he says.’ Slowly Peter opened the door to the river and stood there at the opening, the water lapping at his feet. Behind him Place and Nona shuffled into place so that all three were visible to the police on the river. Coffin stood up in the launch facing them. ‘So that's how it is? You're a fool, Place. And your own worst enemy. Let the kid go.’ A small fleet of boats were now in position in an arc around the entrance. Place could not see the police presence on the river walk above his head, but he could probably guess it was there. He shouted out his demands. A car to get away with. No pursuit. No helicopter to hang overhead. If they let this happen he would shoot the girl. Otherwise he would release her when he felt safe. Peter did not believe this for a moment. Nona would not go free. She would be shot. It was up to him to save her and he knew how to do it. He was standing directly in front of Terry Place, with Nona to his right. He measured the distance between his foot and Place's leg, then between Nona and the river's edge. The tide was already on the turn, you could just see the stone margin of the path they had walked. I am a horse, he told himself. A great horse with powerful hooves. He delivered a great kick backwards at Terry Place's shins, the edge of his boots like iron. As Place screamed and stumbled, Peter grabbed Nona. ‘Jump! Jump into the river!’ Behind him he heard Place scrambling, then there was a shot. Did it come from behind or from the water? Then a flurry of shots. And as he and Nona hit the water, the world exploded into light and fire."
FIC FIC-H85-004 9.39 "Chapter Six He had known that the death of William Egan would not be the only death. He had even called it ‘not the right death’. But to have this confirmation was hideous. After they had been photographed, after the scene of crime team had swarmed in and over them, after the police surgeon and then a pathologist had done all that had to be done in that room, the bodies still stayed where they were. Of much of this process Coffin was a spectator; he was unable to tear himself away. He had other tasks he could profitably have got on with, but he felt the need to stay. His mood was a mixture of incredulity and sadness. It was unbelievable what he saw and yet there it was. The scene of crime officer kept looking at him, as if he found him in the way but did not know how to say so. The quiet and terrible peace of the death scene had been broken into by the need to measure, to check for fingerprints, and to find forensic debris. All over the room a search had gone on for what the scientists called ‘forensic residues’. Disorder as well as death had now visited the room. Coffin stayed until the bodies were packaged up and taken away to the police mortuary for the pathologist's investigation. He knew the pathologist, a woman doctor who had once been young but found  her work was ageing her fast. Then he had a word with the scene of crime officer before he went away. ‘Poison, of course.’ He had sent Mrs Brocklebank home in a police car, and the headmaster of the boy's school had taken charge of the boy. Now he spoke almost to himself, but the other man answered. ‘Looks like it, sir.’ The young policeman was polite. ‘But of course we'll know more when Professor Bearden has had a look.’ He was businesslike and unmoved. This was certainly a strange case, but he had not known the Pitts and he saw plenty of messy deaths. There was no sign of violence on the bodies, no bullet wounds, no stabbing, but signs of sudden convulsive death. Edward Pitt had risen to his feet, knocking over his chair before collapsing. Irene had fallen across the table. Nona rested in her chair with.her head back. He could see her open eyes. All three of them were stiff, with darkened faces as if the blood had been drawn upwards to the skin by capillary action, and there oxidized. ‘I could almost name the poison,’ said Coffin. ‘But how? And why?’ Most of all why? Who could want to poison a whole family? ‘There doesn't have to be a reason,’ said the other man. ‘You mean it's an accident?’ ‘No, sir. I meant sometimes there isn't a real reason. Not what you and I call a reason.’ He shrugged. ‘Maybe someone just didn't like the colour of their hair.’ You had to admit the truth of that, Coffin thought. But you didn't have to like it. Also, he was not going to accept it, he was going to look for a real motive for this murder. If it was murder and not some terrible accident. He went off down the street, stepping lightly over the famous steps, which, without Mrs Brocklebank to clean them, looked sticky and stained. At some time something had certainly fallen on the steps, staining them for ever. Coffin did not notice them. He believed in a lot of things, like natural justice, good money driving out bad, and the inequality of the sexes, but not in long-life blood. Coffin went back to his office, where the death of William Egan at the hands, as they believed, of his son-in-law Terry Place, was still being investigated. The latest report on Place's condition was that he would certainly live, and they might be able to speak to him tomorrow. Meanwhile their investigation had received help from Roxie Farmer's reluctant admission that her brother had been staying with her, and that he had gone off one day, borrowing her former husband's bike, and had come back with blood on him. At the moment she could not remember which day this was, but she might be able to if she thought about it. And yes, she had recently lost a kitchen knife. For Roxie she had said a lot. She had delivered herself of this statement to Inspector Paul Lane, who was gently triumphant at what he had got. ‘She's delighted we've got Place and that he's really banged up. If he dies, she'll put on mourning but she won't cry.’ Coffin read her statement, and thought there were still questions to ask, such as, Was your brother on drugs and if so where did he get them? Or: Can you think of any other reason why he should kill with such a frenzy of violence? But meanwhile he must go to see Terence Place's wife, who also was not weeping. Someone would have to tell Christopher Court, MP, that the woman he was expecting to marry was dead. Perhaps someone had done so already. And he himself would telephone Laetitia to tell her. Irene had been her friend. Have to do it gently, he told himself, no shocks for that pregnant lady. He thought with pleasure of his sister's elegant face with the skin that always had a gleam and yet was softly, darkly creamy at the same time. Half-brother, half-sister, with Letty the child of his mother and a wartime alliance with a GI, they did not look alike. He stared out of his office window where, instead of seeing the busy main road with buses and lorries running along it, another strong image filled his mind. Now he was looking at a building, possibly a house. In the middle, humping up the roof like an ungainly pillar, stood the death of William Egan at the hands of Terry Place; at one end, like a bearing wall, was the whole dead Pitt family, and then at the other end there sprouted, surprisingly, as a kind of ante chapel, the death of the student, Malcolm Kincaid. One of the three students who had appeared to be missing, and then had turned up. Malcolm was the one who had died later. By poison, just like the Pitts. He was building this house and he did not know why. He stretched out his hand to the telephone. Letty first, then Mrs Place. Out of one case, then into another. Or was it? Other houses, real houses, in the neighbourhood were being touched by what had happened to the Pitt family in No. 22, Church Row. Sarah Fleming came home from her day at the Poly where she had heard the news of the killing in the college refectory. It was her habit after the lecture on the theory of economics, which she found particularly intractable as a subject, to take her notes (she was a sparse but efficient notetaker) to a quiet table by the window, drink some coffee and study what she had written down. If she understood it then, all was well. If not, there was still time to ask someone, or do some reading in the library. If she let the subject go cold on her, then she never got it straight in her mind. She knew her own areas of brilliance, she was a political philosopher and would make her mark in that subject if given time. The refectory had been built when there was money around for building and the architect had let himself go with walls of glass and a high curving ceiling panelled in pastel colours. He had got a prize for the design, although the users of it would not now have endorsed this since it was both hot and noisy. It was known as ‘the goldfish bowl’. Sarah carried her cup of coffee and cheese roll back  to her chosen table and settled to work. On days like this she resolutely closed her mind to worries about Weenie and Co., put thoughts about Peter aside, and concentrated on herself. It was the only way forward. She bit into her cheese roll. She would have preferred ham, being a natural meat-eater, but cheese was cheaper and money was always short with her. Fortunately the wedge of cheese was thick and tasty and for this she was grateful. She would have eaten it anyway because she was hungry, she was nearly always hungry, it was almost the only thing she had in common with Weenie. A bite of roll, a drink of coffee, three pages of her text mastered. She was happy. Unsurprised, she felt her happiness broken into. ‘Sal?’ She looked up. Henrietta Fullove and Martin Jones. He had a father who was a police sergeant and always knew everything first. But to show he was independent and a big boy he had lately taken to spelling his name with a small letter: martin. ‘You live in Greenwich, don't you? In Church Row?’ ‘Not Church Row. Just round the corner.’ ‘Not far, then. Did you know about the family that has been found dead? All of them. All in one room.’ Sarah stared in silence. Then she said: ‘Who? What name?’ ‘Pitt.’ Sarah did not say: This is my own private area, this day, it is all I have, leave me alone. She accepted the invasion as she accepted everything that hit her, without hostility but with a strong inner resolve to fight back. ‘Sit down, Martin.’ She never knew how to make it come out sounding as if she was spelling it with a little ‘m’. ‘Hetty?’ ‘I'm off,’ said Henrietta. ‘Got a seminar. It's martin who wants to talk.’ Miraculously, she could make it sound like a tiny tiny ‘m’. But then she was planning to go on the stage and was already reputed to be collecting points for the Equity card. Martin sat down; he had been wanting to get to know Sarah better for some time and this seemed like a good opportunity. ‘The Pitts. Did you know them?’ ‘I knew them.’ Although the episode with Terry Place and Nona and Peter had received publicity she had managed to conceal her connection with them. But of course she ought to have known that martin Jones would find out in the end. Obviously he did not know from the look on his face. It was a nice face and, other things being equal, she would have responded to that first, she had been wanting to get to know him for a long time. ‘Did you say all dead?’ ‘Yeah. Mass suicide perhaps. Or some accident. Murder even.’ ‘Is it in the papers yet? Or TV or radio?’ ‘No. But it will be.’ She didn't say: I must get home to Peter, but it was her thought. She still sat there. Peter did not read the newspapers, nor listen to the radio or watch television much; he read books or played his games. He wouldn't know yet, wouldn't know about Nona till she told him. She didn't want to be the one to do  that although she knew it was her duty. Usually she did her duty. She took a deep breath. Could she sit through their evening meal, knowing, and not telling? Yes. It might be best. So let someone else do it. A feeling of relief suffused her, a little of the burden she had assumed rolled off her shoulders. ‘What's Church Row like?’ ‘It's a nice street.’ That was true, anyway, but it was a lot of other things as well. The home of Nona Pitt who had greatly troubled her life, the home of her employer, Chief Superintendent Coffin, who troubled her equally but differently. Could you feel anything significant for an older man? She thought she could, and that frightened her. ‘And the Pitts?’ ‘Nice as well,’ she responded cautiously. He looked at her cup. ‘Some more coffee?’ ‘I ought to get back to work.’ ‘Let's take a walk. And you can tell me about the Pitts.’ He was going to write fiction, and to write fiction you had to gather facts about life: tales, emotions, relationships. And a triple death was something. He sensed she was in a position to tell him. The Polytechnic enclosed a small square garden which the architect had seen as a kind of cloister for scholarly pacing. There wasn't much of that done in it, but a good deal of rendezvousing and sitting in the sun. The grass in the centre was consequently beaten down and dry. She nodded nervously, not sure why. ‘Like another roll to take out?’ He was going to  have one himself. He hoped she chose ham, they were the best. She nodded again, feeling exactly like Weenie. ‘Ham, please.’ As they passed under the arch into the cloister, he said: ‘Did you like the Pitts? I think you must have done.’ Not quite true, Sarah thought, although I could see their good points. ‘Did most people like them?’ ‘I don't know. I don't think I ever talked about them to anyone.’ Except to Peter, of course, who had talked about them constantly. But even then, she had listened rather than talked back. They were a nuisance in her life and that was the truth of it. ‘Admired, I suppose. Yes, I did admire them.’ ‘And other people? The neighbours and people in the shops, did they admire them?’ ‘Well, they might have done. They had a beautiful car, always had lovely clothes, and looked so good. Got things right somehow.’ ‘Envious, was that it?’ ‘I wasn't envious.’ Not true. She had been very envious of Nona, even of Irene. ‘My dad thinks it's because they were what they were that they were killed.’ ‘But that's terrible.’ She wasn't as shocked as she pretended to be, though; it was likely that was the way it had been. ‘Didn't fit in. Successful, when they would have done better not to be so successful. Or not to show it. Too much money for round here. Wrong school for the children, wrong clothes, wrong car. Showing themselves different.’ As well as politics and economics, he read sociology. ‘They should have merged. But they stood out.’ ‘They couldn't help it.’ ‘Wouldn't have mattered in Chelsea or Hammersmith, but round here…wrong.’ Sarah finished her ham roll. ‘So what do you want from me?’ ‘Any ideas who it could be?’ ‘No, of course not.’ And I wouldn't tell you if I had. Entirely too high a price for a bit of ham and bread. ‘My dad thinks it's what he calls a ‘neighbourhood’ crime. Some person noticed them and hated them for what they were.’ ‘What you're saying is: they deserved to be killed.’ ‘I'm not saying that,’ he said, as if he might not be, but someone else might. ‘I don't think the police ought to talk like that.’ John Coffin, she felt sure, would not; he might think the same things, but would not say them in that way. She wiped her mouth clean of the little bit of fat from the ham. ‘I must be off home. I have to see my brother.’ The moment she thought of Peter, then Martin (no, she would not think of him in that ridiculous way with a small m) no longer looked so good, so handsome. Not a patch on Peter. She rushed into the house, throwing her books on a chair. Peter was lying back on the sofa, doing nothing in particular. ‘You're back early.’ ‘I've left you alone too much. I left you on your own all day yesterday.’ He averted his eyes. ‘Yesterday I had Weenie,’ he said with a hint of irony. ‘She was sick because she  ate too much. Today she's back at school. I dare say she will be sick again tomorrow. I expect she'll try to be.’ ‘You say horrible things.’ ‘I've got horrible lately.’ ‘And that's true.’ But she excused him, as she always excused all of them, except herself. Only she herself knew the evil thoughts she had and how effortlessly they could be translated into action. ‘I'll make a cup of tea.’ No, she would not tell Peter that the person he loved most in the world was dead. Someone he loved more than he loved her, which was a hard pill to swallow. Not that she was jealous, she just thought that Nona had too much of everything. In the scales of life Nona was right up, and the Flemings down, down, down. Now the girl was gone. And Sarah knew, while Peter didn't. It amazed her that she should find it difficult to tell him. If anyone had said to her yesterday that it would be almost beyond her powers to tell Peter of Nona's death, she would have laughed. As easy as eating pie, she would have said. She knew better now. Then she saw that Peter had been crying and that he had taken the trouble to wear a clean, white shirt. White could be a colour of mourning, and cleanliness probably was too. So somehow or other, he knew. She carried the tea back in, hot and sweet in big mugs. There was some gingerbread as well. ‘Who told you?’ He did not attempt to deny it. ‘Went for a walk. Saw a policeman outside No. 22. People standing  staring. Something was wrong. I asked.’ And then: ‘How do you know?’ ‘Someone at the Poly.’ You wouldn't think lightning could strike in the same place twice would you? But apparently with Nona it could. Death had really gone looking for her. There was a crowd now in Church Row. Mr Brocklebank, who had been sent by his wife to look at the house, reported back. He said what Sarah Fleming had been thinking. ‘Poor unlucky kid. You wouldn't think it could happen twice.’ ‘It's the house,’ said his wife sombrely. ‘Now cut that out, old girl.’ She ran through the record. All the deaths in the past, some were history, those were painless, but not the new ones. The student, William Egan, all the Pitt family. No, it was no joke. He did not dispute her catalogue. ‘Never said it was a joke. Not one to laugh at, at least.’ There were occasionally cosmic jokes, you all felt the force of those, they were masked by the words, war, earthquake, or air crash, and this might be one of them. He had a pious sense of his own importance and had always thought all these acts were directed at him, from which he had only escaped by good luck. ‘You ought to tell the police. Nothing to do with what's happened now, of course, I'm not saying that, but you ought to tell them.’ His voice was coaxing. ‘Let me telephone that policeman you work for. Get him to come to you here. He's a decent sort, he'll do it and then you can talk to him.’ She thought it over. ‘No. I ought to go down to the police station. It would be more suitable.’ ‘Are you up to it, Rhoda?’ But she thought she was. ‘If you come with me.’ Ben Brocklebank was a tall, well-built man, but his wife was as tall and nearly as sturdy. Side by side, a matching pair, both in their best clothes, they set off for the police station on Royal Hill. She took his arm. ‘There was nothing really wrong in what I did, Ben.’ ‘Of course not, Rhoda.’ ‘Just taking a liberty. Nothing worse. I'm glad I told you all about it at the time. That sets me right with myself.’ Before she left she had gone into her kitchen, ostensibly to lock the back door, but in fact to look at her new refrigerator, her automatic washing-machine and her food-mixer. She had a new sink and new bright yellow cabinets to go with them. She had given the food-mixer a pat; it was the new object she loved best. She had never used it. Royal Hill police headquarters was housed in a new building. Opened last year,. it had been designed by an architect who was a follower of the new brutalism in architecture for which a police building gave full scope. It was an uncompromising block which looked as though it could withstand a siege. The set of rooms assigned to the TAS unit was at the rear with its own entrance and allocated car parking. Offered to allow them a kind of autonomy, Coffin knew it had been meant originally as a Traffic Inquiry Unit. It was furnished with a certain meanness of equipment that made them feel like poor relations. Coffin was fighting  hard for all he needed, but cuts and economies were the rule of the day, and this was 1978 and no one liked the police. He was surprised to see Mrs Brocklebank and slightly more surprised to see Ben Brocklebank whom he had never absolutely believed in before, thinking him more an excuse than a man, someone Mrs B. sheltered behind when it suited her not to do something. He listened to what she had to say. ‘So you hid William Egan in No. 22? Exactly why did you do that?’ He was not disposed to be easy with her. She muttered something about knowing him all her life, and he hadn't got any money. Come out of prison and look for a living in 1978? Well, you couldn't. He hadn't a penny to his name. ‘So he came to you and said can you put me up and you did?’ asked an unfeeling Coffin. ‘Pretty generous-minded of you. With your employer's property.’ So now he knew where the mouse droppings had come from on Egan's clothes. From the basement of the Pitt house. And that was why he had dirty boots from the road works in Church Row. He had walked in the muck. Just as Coffin had himself, and others too for all he knew. (Sarah Fleming could have confirmed this from her observations of the boots of Weenie and Co.) ‘I didn't know where else to put him.’ He had something on her, he thought. A weak woman who looked strong, he thought. Blackmail, that had the mark of William Egan. But he would not find out more while the husband was there. Was  she the third person, whose presence he had always sensed? She muttered something about him paying what he could. ‘Oh, so he did pay something?’ ‘You didn't tell me that, Rhoda,’ said Ben Brocklebank alertly. ‘It wasn't much.’ ‘And what did you do with it?’ ‘Yes,’ said Coffin. ‘What did you?’ ‘I had a little debt.’ She did not meet his eyes. ‘I was clearing it off.’ A lie? Or part of the blackmail? ‘And then I found out,’ said Ben. ‘Caught the old girl with a bottle of whisky in her bag. What's this? I said. Who's on the bottle?’ ‘So you went round and turned him out?’ ‘Well, no. By that time he'd upped and gone. Left a note saying the mice were getting him down. And that night he was killed.’ So he had probably left exactly when he meant to leave, intending to attack Terry Place but being killed himself. ‘All that rigmarole about the house being a haunted house was just to keep people from inquiring if they saw any signs of William Egan's habitation?’ Infestation, he nearly said. ‘Perhaps I put it on a bit, but that's a bad house.’ She spoke earnestly. ‘And I mean it.’ ‘Now don't go back to that, old girl,’ said Ben. ‘Just forget talk like that. She's not herself,’ he said, turning to Coffin. ‘But no one could call it a lucky house, could they?’ ‘No.’ Coffin turned to Mrs Brocklebank. ‘You had a bad shock. How are you now?’ ‘I'm not thinking about it. Trying not to. I still keep seeing them, though. And it had a sort of smell, that room. I can still smell it… Do you know how they died yet, sir?’ ‘It was probably poison.’ He could tell her that much, and he owed it to her to say something. She had cleared up a few worrying points about William Egan. Then he had a thought. ‘Did you know Terry Place too?’ She nodded. ‘Well?’ She shook her head. ‘Roxie's your friend, isn't she?’ said Ben, who seemed determined to open up channels in Coffin's mind. ‘Thick as thieves.’ ‘It must have been difficult for you, hiding Egan when Place was living with his sister.’ ‘I never said and she never said. We know when to keep quiet.’ So you do, thought Coffin, so you do. The interlinked circles of this part of London, declining and changing now as social patterns altered and moved people away, but still strong in those groups which had gone to school together, married within their peer group and worked side by side, struck him afresh. But I'm one of them, he thought. Look at me now, back here, and with Rhoda Brocklebank working for me. It was really better to be like Paul Lane, about  as rootless as you could be, moving easily around as served your ambition and owing no one anything. Perhaps he and Laetitia should forget their search for their missing brother or sister, who, after all, might not want to be found, and let the past look after itself? There was the younger generation, the Flemings, they were another case of it; they certainly had their roots here, but they were different again. Sarah Fleming would break away. Brains and education and character would do it for her. She was bent on it. Perhaps a community like this resented outsiders and would always try to throw them out? Was this what had happened with the Pitts? But there was another factor in their case, as he was well aware. He had had Bernard Jones on the telephone muttering about a ‘neighbourhood’ crime and he had found the idea disquieting. To accept it required a whole sociology of crime. But perhaps he preferred it to a haunted house, because, as he saw it, that would require metaphysics as well. ‘You go on home,’ he said to Rhoda Brocklebank. ‘Don't bother to come in to work tomorrow.’ It was one of her days for him. ‘Oh, I'm going to.’ She had given up calling him ‘sir’, he noticed. ‘I'll come to you and glad to, but never to that other house. Never again.’ She saw a haunted house, a superstition she had perhaps used for her own account, and he saw something more human, a complex web of relationships, interlocking and interacting in a way he could not yet fathom, and in which people got caught up and  destroyed. She was thinking about the Pitts, and he was thinking about his sister. Paul Lane came into the room just as he had finished telephoning Laetitia. His third telephone call of the day to her, she needed his words. ‘It was potassium cyanide. Powder form. In the soup. Curry soup would hide the taste until it was too late. How and when it got in there we don't know as yet. Could have been an accident.’ ‘Irene Pitt was planning to cook curry soup,’ said Coffin. ‘Told me so herself. I met her and she told me. She made the curry powder herself.’ ‘Then she may have taken the poison for one of the spices. Mistaken it somehow.’ ‘She was going to shop for spices in Greenwich Market. I told her it was a good place.’ ‘Well, we'll ask. It's a start. Roxie Farmer and Shirley Place, unlikely sisters-in-law, were under one roof for the time being. They were sitting in the kitchen over a cup of tea. There was no pretence of grief on either side for the death of William Egan or the predicament of Terry Place. As far as the women were concerned, they had wiped each other out and that was that. ‘While they needed us, we did what we could,’ said Shirley. ‘As far as we could.’ Their eyes met. Roxie assented: ‘As far as we could.’ They understood each other. ‘You had your Terry here when he got out, and I'm grateful to you because if it hadn't been you, it would have had to be me, and with Dad the way he was, I was better out of the country. He'd have beat me up  as well as Terry if he could. I'm sorry he had to go the way he did, but it was always going to happen, the sort of man he was. Dad, I used to say, you are your own worst enemy and someone'll kill you for it one day. Of course I didn't think it would be Terry when I married him. You don't think of things like that on your wedding day.’ ‘No,’ Roxie nodded. She never talked as much as Shirley. ‘Another cup?’ ‘If you like, dear.’ The kitchen was bright and newly furnished with the best of domestic equipment. Dishwasher, automatic washing-machine, a luxury freezer, even Rhoda Brocklebank hadn't got more. ‘You've got this place lovely.’ Shirley stirred her tea. A crocodile handbag lay on the table and she had just slipped off her new Italian shoes. ‘You're the homemaking type. I'm more of a party girl, myself.’ ‘Mmm.’ ‘But I don't think it matters what you are, as long as you've got the money to do it.’ From where she sat, Shirley could see the street. ‘Oh look, visitors. Now that's a car full of cops, if ever I saw one.’ Roxie looked and saw Chief Superintendent Coffin and Inspector Lane. ‘I think they've come to see you.’ She felt quite calm after her talk with Shirley, who was a good sort, if rough. ‘After they've gone, shall we have our little bonfire?’ It was a routine call on the bereaved Mrs Place who had lost her father and who might soon be a widow, who had perhaps shed a few tears, but not very many. Yet it was Shirley Place who kept the interview firmly null and void. No, she couldn't help them at all. She had been away on a little holiday in Spain and knew nothing. A total shock. Yes, she was very shocked. Hardly knew how to conduct herself, but Roxie was being so kind. Yes, it was terrible what her husband had done, and she couldn't explain it. He had been a violent man and her father had been a man even more violent, it was a pity they had ever met. ‘They met in prison,’ Coffin reminded her sharply, ‘apart from anywhere else.’ A deep breath and a pat with her handkerchief at her eyes. Roxie looked more grieved than she did, much more. There was a heart in Roxie somewhere. As they left, Coffin said to Paul Lane: ‘I'd like to know what they were talking about when we got there. Something was going on.’ ‘Is there anything more to go on? Egan is dead, Place killed him. We'll probably get a confession if he ever comes round. End of case.’ ‘Oh, you're such a realist, Paul. You're sometimes so busy looking at the wood that you don't smell the trees are rotten.’ ‘I'm not sure I know what you mean. I'm not sure I know myself.’ But there was that house in his mind, he was building it again, putting room after room. It was getting to be as big as a cathedral. No, not a cathedral, nothing like a cathedral. A great chambered tomb."
FIC FIC-H85-001 9.57 "Chapter Three The murder case slipped easily into its next phase, as if it had been programmed by a computer that had access to several personal files and knew where they interacted. Coffin was still pondering on the significance of what he had seen written on the piece of paper from Place's jacket. He had sent jacket and paper off to the laboratories, demanding an instant report. This had arrived and a copy had been sent to Inspector Lane. As far as they could tell, the writing, by a ballpoint, was Egan's. The paper was of poor quality and had been torn off a pad of the kind you might keep in a kitchen or by a telephone. In Place's pocket it had picked up fluff and minute scraps of human skin and hair. It had both Egan's fingerprints on it and those of Place, blurred but identifiable. At the same time a determined police search for Terry Place began in the area down by the river. It was neither quiet nor unobtrusive, since it was not intended to be. The aim was to frighten Place into acting hastily. Within a further twenty-four hours, his sister, Mrs Roxie Farmer, divorcee, was taken in for questioning at Royal Hill police station, but claimed she knew nothing. In spite of an onslaught by Inspector Paul Lane, she gave nothing away. That is, until the very end of the interview. Lane had been assisted by a woman police officer, Detective  -Sergeant Phyllis Henley, a thickset girl, whom he had called in because she was an old friend or enemy of Roxie whose own life had not been without criminal excitements. On the table between the two police officers, in view of Roxie, lay the forensic report on the jacket found in Roxie's house. ‘Come on now, Roxie, you know me.’ Sergeant Henley prided herself on her power to prise out information by a mixture of persuasion and light bullying like the icing on a cake, and although this had never worked particularly well with Roxie in the past, this was no reason not to try it now. Roxie stayed silent as if she was determined not to be cozened, but she shifted uneasily in her chair. ‘You can trust me.’ Roxie looked sceptical, but still said nothing, just another little fidget. ‘If I say we know your brother has been with you, then you can believe we do know. And if I say we think you know where he is now, then you can believe we know that too.’ It was a long speech for Sergeant Henley, who relied on smiles and sighs and significant silences. And then a snap. The snap came now. ‘Roxie, you had a tweed jacket hanging in your hall and that tweed jacket was worn by him very recently.’ She did not add that it had blood on it, although she knew that too, having just read the forensic report. Roxie shrugged. ‘Something sharp cut the pocket lining. Lost a kitchen knife, have you, Roxie?’ Roxie looked sullen. ‘Threaten you with it, did he, Roxie? Where's your  daughter, Roxie? Sent her away, haven't you? Threaten her with the knife, if you talked, did he?’ Roxie found her voice. ‘Shut up, you.’ Sergeant Henley gave the Inspector a quick triumphant glance. ‘I think I could make a guess where your daughter is, and probably so could he. I know where your aunt lives. He's better caught. Tell us where he is then, Roxie.’ Roxie set her mouth firmly in silence. It looked like the edge of a knife itself. Sergeant Henley said, without noticeable kindness: ‘If I were you, Roxie, I'd get your daughter home. She'd be better off with you than that drunken aunt of yours. Mrs Bow, she is now, isn't she? Her husband's none too safe with little girls, or hasn't anyone told you that?’ After a short pause, Roxie muttered: ‘Remember he's a little rat that likes a hole.’ ‘Oh, come on, that's not good enough. No puzzlers.’ Paul Lane was cold. ‘You say what you mean in plain English.’ Sergeant Henley said: ‘Speak up now. Or Uncle Bow might find himself doing a lifer for your Rosie.’ Roxie said suddenly, ‘There's a tunnel down by the river. I don't know where. You'd have to find it. Greenwich Pier. He used to play in it years ago. In the war.’ Years ago, thought Paul Lane, I suppose it's still there. Well, she thinks it is, anyway. ‘Thanks, Roxie,’ he said, and pulled the telephone towards him. When he had given his orders and they were alone he said: ‘You were rough on her, Phyllis.’ ‘But I got a result. And I'll tell you something else: what really frightened Roxie was that the kid might cooperate with Uncle Bow.’ Lane shrugged. He was never sure how to take his Phyllis. ‘It's been known,’ said Phyllis. The message about the tunnel went to John Coffin, who got into touch with the Port of London Authority and the Greenwich Pier management for information and, better still, maps. ‘No picnic, searching down there,’ said the man at the end of the telephone. ‘Do my best for you, but sometimes we don't know what we've got ourselves.’ Next morning in Queen Charlotte's Alley, Sarah Fleming was preparing a picnic for her brother Peter. She was doing so reluctantly, it was her Poly day and she really did not have time. The little ones, the very little ones, called it her ‘Holy day’, not distinguishing clearly between Poly and Holy. Sarah wondered if they were deaf in addition to other deficiencies. Growing deafer, moreover, as they had certainly not been deaf as babies. Putting all their energies into deafness rather than growing bigger and taller. It was the sort of fantasy she must not harbour. ‘I've given you ham and cucumber. And there's a Thermos of coffee.’ ‘It ought to be smoked salmon and champagne for her,’ said Peter. He was dressed ready for his outing in clean jeans and a white shirt. Sarah wore almost the same clothes, except that her shirt was red. A gesture to her political feelings. ‘She's only a kid.’ ‘That's the sort of girl she is.’ He saw himself as a great, strong animal who could always protect his girl. A bear? ‘Count yourself lucky I didn't make you Marmite sandwiches.’ ‘There ought to be wine and music and a boat on the river,’ he said dreamily. ‘And you in a white tie and tails, I suppose.’ They had recently watched an old Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film on the television in which she thought she saw the source of his fantasy. ‘What about work? Aren't you going in?’ He had a part-time job in a large firm of chemists where he worked in the stockrooms. There had been rumours of redundancies. ‘Got the day off. Had it due. Sal…do you think I could do what you are doing? Work for my A's and then go to university?’ ‘Well I've had my turn, only right you should have yours,’ said Sarah judicially. ‘I don't know about the little ones, though. I certainly can't take them to Oxford with me. I was relying on you.’ They both looked at their younger brothers and sisters, who stared blankly back. ‘I could take them out to the middle of a lake in a boat and drop them in. They can't swim. I have taken that precaution.’ ‘I never know when you are serious or not.’ ‘And I never know with you,’ she answered. There was a pause, broken by the girl. ‘You'd have to stop playing games.’ ‘I don't play games.’ Sarah shrugged. ‘I'd manage.’ He looked hopeful. ‘Fix something up. I might go to night school or something. Or the Open University.’ ‘You'd have to work at your grades.’ His sister was at once more realistic and more perceptive. ‘You've never been much of an exam passer.’ Very poor, in fact, but no point in discouraging him. Another dream, though. He had so many. She saw him passing the day in a cloud of dreams. ‘You mean why bother?’ he said, seeing more than she had meant him to. ‘I want to be as good as them, the Pitts. Look at what they are and what we are. What we've got and what they've got. It's not right. Things ought to be more equal.’ ‘We're what we are and they are what they are.’ For various reasons, intellectual, historical and sexual, it was easier for her to accept things as they were than for Peter. Round the corner in No 22, Church Row, Irene Pitt was watching her daughter prepare for a picnic. ‘Sure you want to go?’ ‘Got to.’ Irene raised her eyebrows. ‘That's not the way to enjoy yourself. If that's what you are going to do, of course.’ ‘I promised. ‘Is that a bottle of wine?’ ‘I thought we could use it.’ ‘Want any fruit? There's a pineapple in the refrigerator. Brie? I bought a nice wedge yesterday. Plenty if you want it. I'm going out to lunch myself.’ With Chris, of course. ‘Just the wine.’ They were in the kitchen, Irene still in a dressing-gown, an ivory frilled cotton to which she gave a golden glow, and Nona in jeans with a white shirt. Edward had gone off to see an editor at the BBC; he wanted to talk about a project on the Third World, and the boy was at school. ‘How did you get the day off from school?’ Irene slipped a few rich chocolates in a plastic bag and gave them to her daughter. ‘The sixth form can work at home.’ She looked at her mother. ‘All right, this isn't work, but it's a goodbye session.’ Or it would be, if she could get Peter to understand. ‘I told you. So it's only once.’ Irene laughed. ‘We always think that. It's not so easy saying goodbye.’ 'Breaking things up? No, I know that. A lot of things are breaking up now.’ 'You mean because of Chris and me. Do you mind? But that's silly. Of course you mind.’ 'Yes, I do. Who will I stay with, you or Dad?’ 'I suppose you will choose. You know that. We agreed.’ The divorce had been talked over thoroughly in New York, or so she had thought. Now she wondered. But goodness knows, Nona had had her say there. Nona looked around the kitchen. ‘I might stay here. Just might. I'd want to go on seeing you a lot, though.’ 'Thanks.’ 'Don't be sharp. It's one of your worst things.’ 'Is that why you've never told me before what happened with you and Peter before we all went to New York? Did you think I'd be sharp? I wouldn't  have been. But I think you wanted me to know. You let me read that story you wrote for your class magazine: The Dragon's Mouth. That was really you and Peter finding that thing in the wood, wasn't it?’ ‘Might have been.’ ‘Might?’ ‘Was, then.’ ‘It frightened me that you had not told me. Made it important, very real.’ Nona shrugged. ‘All the same, you didn't hand out many details. You made it a kind of fable. But there was a real incident, I know.’ Nona still kept quiet. ‘I don't want to talk about it. I promised.’ Irene would have gone on, but for the arrival of Mrs Brocklebank. She surveyed Nona and her preparation for a picnic. ‘Off out? It's going to rain.’ ‘It won't rain.’ Nona slung her bag over her shoulder. ‘Thanks for the chocs. Anyway, we're going to see the Cutty Sark.’ ‘A lot of police down there. You're not supposed to see them, but you can. All over the place like rabbits.’ ‘Who cares?’ Nona picked up the wine bottle, gave her mother a look and was gone. Mrs Brocklebank had created a little nest for herself in the basement where she put her clothes and her big black handbag, from which she was only rarely and reluctantly parted, and where she tucked away any odds and ends it was better Brock at home did not see. Money was one. A woman was entitled to her own savings. She had such nests in every one of  her working places, which her employers were only vaguely aware of. She had a kind of natural skill in camouflage. Now she went to her corner next to which was a cupboard no one seemed to know about except Mrs Brocklebank, shared by her and a certain amount of animal life, and deposited her bag and coat. There was a small mirror hanging on the door in which she combed her hair; a woman liked to look her best even at work. She was troubled and anxious. ‘As though one death wasn't enough,’ she said to herself. ‘There's got to be others, by the look of it. And they say there's nothing wrong with this house and I'm imagining things.’ She had been a childhood friend of William Egan and though no one could truly mourn such a man of violence, still she had her loyalties, and he was a man who had known how to trade on them. Later that day she would pop in, her words, to see Roxie Farmer in Abinger Road; she knew her too. ‘Roxie,’ she would say, ‘every one of us has to look after their own. It's our duty, and you and I have done it. Me in my way, you in yours. But that Terry of yours has put himself beyond it. I reckon I know where he is as well as you do, and I might have to say. If he gets killed, he's got only himself to blame.’ All the same, she wished she had been stronger in her advice to Nona not to go down by the Cutty Sark. She had been too indirect, she should have said: Look love, this is old Brocklebank speaking straight. It could be dangerous down there. She got out her scrubbing brush. ‘I'll just give the  front step a scrub. I didn't like the look of it at all this morning. The police and picnickers converged upon the river. Peter and Nona were not the only people planning to eat in the open air, because a coachload of school-children together with four teachers, all carrying packed lunches, had arrived to visit the Cutty Sark and then Gypsy Moth in its dry dock. ‘Lot of people about. Too many.’ It wasn't what Peter had had in mind when he had thought of the picnic. Something more pastoral and solitary had been his vision. ‘Some of them are policemen, I think. Mrs Brocklebank said so.’ Nona looked about her with interest, trying to identify which of the young men in her vicinity could possibly be policemen. ‘There has been a murder, you know. They are looking for clues, I suppose. And for the murderer.’ ‘I know. I don't want to talk about it.’ He gripped her arm. ‘Come on. There's a lot of things I want to show you. ‘Yes, and I want to see. I am very interested. I like objects, I've discovered that recently. But don't hold me so tight.’ He had once been the leader and she had been the unquestioning follower, but all that had changed now. Surely he could see it. He did not seem to have heard. ‘Quickly now. First the Cutty Sark and then we'll explore down by the river. Then our picnic on the hill by the Old Observatory.’ But when they were in the clipper Nona took a  more detailed interest than he did. She was fascinated by the Saloon, set out for dinner with silver and glass; she hovered over the display of figureheads; but it was the rigging of the clipper that caught her imagination most. She stood at the foot of the mainmast, staring up at the intricacy of the complicated tracery of sails, spars and rope. ‘You know why it is called the Cutty Sark?’ ‘Just a name.’ Peter was not interested. ‘Had to call it something.’ ‘It's from Robert Burns's poem Tam o’ Shanter. It's about a witch who chased him on his mare. The Cutty Sark is the little shift or chemise the witch was wearing. ‘Funny name.’ ‘It probably comes from the French word sacque, that was a kind of loose blouse. It must mean the pronunciation was nearer to sark than sack.’ ‘Or at least in Scotland.’ He turned away. He hated being instructed. ‘Anyway, it's not a bad name for a ship. I suppose it means she went like a witch.’ The vessel was getting crowded now as another school party arrived. Nona would have lingered, looking at the fo'c'sle where the crew had slept, and the galley where the food was prepared, but he hurried her on. ‘Let's go down to the pier. I want to show you something.’ The two of them were noticed and observed by at least two policemen. One was a young detective-constable, seconded from the Bromley district, who noticed Nona. He thought she was beautiful. He considered trying to make her acquaintance, but two  things moved against it. First, he was on a job, and secondly, he knew without putting into words that she was no girlfriend for an ambitious copper. There was a third thing: he had caught sight of a superior officer: John Coffin. Coffin was the other police officer who saw them. He gave the pair a friendly glance as they walked towards the riverside. He was here checking up on the search for Terry Place. The feeling was the hunt was going well; they would find him. Earlier that morning, speaking on the telephone, Paul Lane had said, ‘With the number of men we have searching he can't get away. Not if he's in the area, and everything tells me he is.’ ‘He could stay in hiding a long while before we flushed him out.’ No one knew better than John Coffin what a network of alleys, underground passages, and dark basements nestling in old buildings still lay near the river. ‘Not the way I see it.’ Lane had been positive in his usual clear-minded manner. One did not use the word cocky of such as Paul Lane, but it did cross Coffin's mind, if in no unfriendly spirit. He had been cocky himself once, and none the worse for it now. ‘I'll keep in touch.’ That was the other side of the coin with the Inspector. He might be strong in his own opinions but he did not go haring off on his own. He kept in touch. A young plain clothes man touched his arm. ‘Inspector Lane is looking for you, sir. He's over there in his car.’ Coffin turned his back to the pier, Peter and Nona  had already disappeared down a flight of steps, and walked towards the road, where a line of police vehicles was drawn up. Lane sprang out of the first car at his approach. ‘We've got him, sir.’ ‘Good. Where?’ ‘Get in, and we'll go there. Forget the river. I reckon Roxie was leading us on there. Now we place him in a house. Up the hill, more towards Charlton way. Not down here by the river as we thought, after all. He always was a cunning beggar, and Roxie's another one.’ As the car travelled up the hill in Greenwich Park, Lane explained. ‘He was sighted by a local man on the beat, was at school with him, is sure it's Terry.’ ‘You mean you haven't actually got your hands on him?’ ‘He was seen going into a house in Maryon Park Gardens. It's a street his sister admits he knew, had a girlfriend there. And he's not answering the door or coming out. It has to be Place.’ They drew up before one of a pair of red brick semi-detached houses in a street of other houses like it. ‘And this is it?’ Coffin studied the neat quiet house with a plot of garden in the front. ‘Who's the house owner?’ ‘Neighbours say it's an old chap called Masterton. He's in hospital. He's had lodgers in and out.’ There was another police car at the kerb, with a woman sitting in the back. Coffin studied her face. She looked unhappy. ‘That's Place's sister. Roxie Farmer. We got her  down here.’ He turned towards Coffin. ‘So what now? Do we go in?’ ‘No.’ Coffin sat back. ‘Not yet. We wait.’ Nona and Peter wandered by the river, with Peter pointing out the various features that interested him. Nona stared at the grey river where the wind was picking up little waves and throwing them against the walls of the river walk. ‘Do you ever think about that thing that happened to us in the park? Before I went away. Do you think about it?’ ‘A long while ago now, Nona.’ ‘It was horrible.’ She shivered. ‘Animals die in the open air.’ He stroked her arm. ‘It's natural. Don't let it upset you.’ He was soothing her, but all the same there was excitement rippling through the muscles of his arm. ‘You haven't spoken to anyone about it?’ ‘No. No, I haven't spoken to anyone.’ Not spoken, no. Told the whole world through a short story, if they wanted to read it. Looking down at the river, she could see that the level had dropped, uncovering lines of bricks on the wall beneath them that looked as if they rarely saw the sun. The timber supports of the pier could be seen increasingly. ‘Low tide.’ Peter nodded and drew her to the rail of the river-walk to look over the side. ‘That's why I wanted us to get moving. I knew the tide would be on the ebb. And it's a very low tide now. Things get uncovered that you can't see easily at other times.’ He knew  about the river; in different times might have worked on it, happily and well. He pointed to a dark patch to their left and very low down. ‘See that door?’ She tried to make it out. ‘Is there a door?’ ‘Doesn't look like one from here, but it is one. You'll see when we get closer.’ ‘Are we going to get closer?’ She looked down at her white slippers, not fancying the mud and muck she could see there. Also, would they have to swim? ‘There's a tunnel behind the door. It leads right up the hill into the park. I've heard that there's another door in the park somewhere, but I've never been able to find it. I spent hours looking when I was a kid.’ ‘What was the tunnel used for?’ Seriously, he said, ‘I used to think for smuggling or for prisoners to escape. But I suppose really it was for supplies that came by ship to be carried to some of the houses on the hill, the Ranger's House, or the Observatory.’ ‘Is it used now?’ He shook his head, looking amused. ‘Most people don't know anything about it.’ ‘You do, though.’ He nodded. ‘I've been down there. It's good. Secret. Private.’ He took her hand in his own warm, dry one. ‘Come on. Let's go there now.’ ‘No. It looks wet and horrible. And I don't see how.’ She tried to draw her hand away. ‘Not wet at all,’ he coaxed. ‘Dry as a bone. And there's a little ledge to walk on. You won't get your feet wet. Or I could carry you.’ ‘If I come, then we won't stay long?’ After all, she had entered on this day to please him. And she had said she wanted to see places of historical interest. He was only doing his bit. ‘No, of course not. Then have our picnic.’ There was an iron gate which looked rusted and stuck but which opened to a touch, a flight of stone steps to the water level, and then she let herself be led along a narrow shelf which from the look of it was usually under water. The entrance to the tunnel was a low wooden door. Tucked away unobtrusively in an angle of the river wall, it was also protected by a brick overhang. She could understand why most people did not know it was there. ‘Do we have to go in? Anyway, it must be locked.’ In spite of her best efforts there was a green stain on her white slippers. ‘And damn, I've dropped the chocolates in the water.’ ‘Forget the chocolates, and the lock is broken. Come on.’ He gave the door a strong push. With a creak it opened inwards on a dark hole. A breath of moist, yeasty air puffed out towards them. ‘Thought you said it wasn't damp?’ ‘Look at the walls and floor. Dry as a bone.’ The walls were brick lined and the floor covered with dull tiles set in a herringbone pattern that reminded her of a Roman villa she had once seen near the South Coast. A small interest stirred inside her. Couldn't be Roman, of course, she could see that, but wasn't it interesting how traditional ways of doing things carried on? ‘If you say so.’ There were things that looked like  ragged mushrooms growing out of the wall. On the other hand, the floor was dry. Peter drew a torch out of his pocket and held it above his head; the beam spread out, eventually spending itself against the darkness of the tunnel. The path rose gently above water level and then bent to the left. Probably it went up the hill in a series of gentle planes. Carts might have been used to drag supplies up it, sufficient width was there. ‘That's it, then.’ She had seen enough and was ready to go. ‘No, let's go inside. Just a bit. I've always wanted to go beyond that curve and I haven't liked to do it on my own.’ She gave him a sharp, surprised look. ‘Why not?’ He shrugged. ‘Don't know what's beyond. Better to have someone with you.’ He was a surprising boy. Imagination and nerves just when you did not expect it. She took a few paces forward. ‘What about rats?’ ‘If there are any, then they will be more frightened of us than we are of them.’ ‘Not true,’ she said with conviction. ‘I will be more frightened than they are.’ ‘Oh, come on. I'll keep any rats away. ‘I thought I heard something.’ ‘Let's take a look.’ He was moving forward, and to keep in touch with him and the light from the torch she had to move too. ‘We might find the other exit. No one 's been here for years.’ ‘No?’ The air in the passage stirred and folded itself about her. She wrinkled her nose. If no one had been here for years, why did she fancy she could smell cigarette smoke? Inside the hall of the house in Maryon Park Gardens, a tearful, frightened little man was explaining that his name was Bill Pitkin, that he was not Terry Place, that he had never seen Terry Place nor ever heard of him. And, no, he had nothing to hide. The only reason he had not opened the front door had been because he was frightened. He did not know who was trying to break in."
FIC FIC-J10-002 9.86 "CHAPTER 2 Unusually, there was a meeting on the British side about how to handle it. Garvin was there, Commandant of the Cairo Police and Owen's nominal superior; McPhee, Deputy Commandant, earnest, concerned and straightforward — too straightforward by half to be a Cairo policeman and far too straightforward for something like this; Paul, an aide-de-camp of the Consul-General's; and Owen. The Consul-General usually steered clear of too direct an involvement in Egyptian policing. Garvin reported formally  to the Khedive — and the Consul-General was punctilious about the forms. He was particularly careful of any involvement with the Mamur Zapt, which was why Owen not only reported formally to the Khedive but was nominally subordinate to Garvin. It was, therefore, unusual to have a meeting of this sort. But then, as Paul, chairing the meeting on behalf of the Consul-General, made clear, the circumstances were unusual. ‘It's not every day that an heir to the throne gets involved in something like this.’ ‘Is he an heir to the throne?’ ‘One of many. The Khedive has a number of sons and all of them see themselves as potential heirs.’ ‘Where does this one fit in?’ ‘He is the son of the Khedive's third wife, so not high up in the stakes. On the other hand, his mother is still a favourite of the Khedive's, which is often significant. He is able and energetic, which makes him stand out among the Khedive's progeny. And front runners in a thing of this sort are unfortunately prone to accidents.’ ‘He seemed a bit of a playboy to me,’ said McPhee. ‘That car, of course. But look at it another way: as an indication of Narouz's interest in things modern and things Western.’ ‘I see.’ ‘Yes. I thought you would. The Consul-General, and Al-Lurd before him, see him as a man England could do business with.’ Al-Lurd was Lord Cromer, the man who had run Egypt for over twenty years before the present incumbent. If two such people, the one popular with Conservatives, the other a nominee of the new Liberal Government in London, took that view, the Prince had a lot going for him. ‘It would be unfortunate,’ said Paul, ‘if he were to be derailed at this point.’ There was a little silence. ‘Is that a directive?’ asked Owen. ‘A hint, rather. Call it: putting you in the picture. Alerting you to the position of His Majesty's Government.’ ‘As strong as that?’ said Garvin. ‘I can relax it a bit, provided you've got the general idea. If he's done anything really wicked I don't think HMG would be prepared to go out on a limb on his behalf. There are, after all, other possible candidates. But if it's only mildly wicked we would feel it a pity to be too legalistic.’ ‘What counts as only mildly wicked?’ ‘I don't think I'd like to give you a general answer. These things have to be decided in the light of circumstances.’ ‘I'm not sure I find that very helpful,’ said Garvin. ‘What exactly is to be our position?’ ‘Aloof,’ said Paul. ‘Aloof, but watching.’ ‘Not get too close to it? Well, that's probably sensible.’ 'Should be manageable,’ said Garvin. ‘After all, it's Parquet business really.’ ‘Quite. The police will assist the Parquet and work under their direction as usual. But that's at the local level. There's no need for senior involvement.’ ‘I quite agree,’ said Garvin. ‘No point in that at all.’ No fool he. ‘McPhee's involved already,’ said Owen. ‘I think he can drop out now.’ ‘The Prince thinks he's involved.’ ‘The Prince, I believe, has changed his mind.’ ‘Since yesterday?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I see.’ Someone else been making telephone calls? ‘I think that's very reasonable,’ said Garvin. ‘McPhee's got enough demands on his time already. When all is said and done, this is just a straightforward crime and we wouldn't normally put him on to something like this.’ ‘We don't even know it is a crime,’ Paul pointed out. ‘No, no, of course not,’ said Garvin, hurriedly changing tack. ‘Could be just an accident.’ ‘It's for the Parquet to decide how it wants to treat it. Crime or accident.’ He looked at Owen. ‘They've put Mahmoud on to it, haven't they?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘How will be play it?’ ‘Straight.’ ‘Mahmoud's a good chap,’ said McPhee. ‘Mahmoud's going to have to take some hard decisions,’ said Paul. He finished his coffee. ‘Which brings me to the final thing we need to discuss. You asked me about the stance we were to adopt. I said aloof. I also said watching.’ ‘We wouldn't want it to go wrong,’ said Garvin. ‘We couldn't afford for it to go wrong. We've got to have someone in there.’ ‘I thought you said you didn't want any senior involvement?’ ‘Overt. No overt involvement at the senior level.’ Another little silence. ‘This is hardly straightforward policing,’ said Garvin slowly. ‘I would say it was more — political.’ ‘You said it was straightforward policing a moment ago. When you wanted to shift it to the Parquet.’ ‘A straightforward crime. Not straightforward policing. There are other dimensions here. Political ones.’ ‘I think Owen's the chap,’ said Paul. ‘I don't like it.’ ‘Who does?’ ‘I'm not going to get involved in any cover-up.’ ‘I don't think Owen should be asked to cover up anything,’ said McPhee. ‘We're not asking him to. Not yet, anyway. And I don't think it need come to that, not if it's handled in the right  way. With a bit of dexterity, I mean. The Press, the politicians, the Prince himself. Mahmoud. The Khedive, too, perhaps.’ ‘It's a tall order.’ ‘I've every confidence in the boy,’ said Paul, watching him. ‘I still don't like it. I'm not going to get involved in any covering up. ‘I hope it won't be necessary. But this is politics. You know, you policemen are lucky. If you meet a bad guy, you lock him up. If I meet a bad guy I usually have to shake hands with him and do a deal.’ ‘I'm not shaking hands,’ said Owen. Paul smiled. ‘You're in politics now,’ he said, ‘whether you like it or not. And I think you'll find you're going to have to take some hard decisions. Like Mahmoud.’ ‘And, of course, there was the harem,’ said the eunuch. ‘The harem?’ said Owen, startled. ‘The Prince always travels with one.’ ‘Even to Luxor?’ asked Mahmoud. ‘Certainly to Luxor. The Prince has an estate there.’ ‘And that's where he had been this time?’ ‘Yes.’ They were sitting in the cabin of the dahabeeyah. It was a modern one, specially fitted out for the Prince, and had windows. Through the window beside him Owen could see a large rat sunning itself on a mooring rope. ‘I had gathered the impression that the Prince had intended to be away only for a few days,’ said Mahmoud. ‘That is true.’ ‘How long did he spend at the estate?’ ‘Two days.’ ‘Only two days? That is a very short time, especially when you have to travel all that way.’ ‘The Prince does not like his estate.’ ‘He was principally interested in seeing Luxor, then?’ ‘The Prince does not like Luxor, either.’ ‘What does he like?’ asked Owen. ‘Cannes.’ In the old days, before the advent of Mr Cook's steamers, when tourists used to sail down to Luxor by dahabeeyah, the port had been full of the old-fashioned, native sailing craft. The tourist would come and choose one. It would then be towed across the river and sunk — temporarily. This was to get rid of the rats. The trick was, though, to sail away immediately that dahabeeyah had been raised. Otherwise it would be reinfested — along the ropes — at once. ‘What, then, was the purpose of his visit?’ asked Mahmoud. The eunuch shrugged. ‘I wouldn't have thought the Prince was one to wish to spend a week admiring the beauties of the river bank.’ ‘The Prince spent his time in the cabin playing cards with the Prince Fahid.’ ‘Ah? The Prince Fahid was on the boat, too?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Had he, too, brought his harem?’ ‘The Prince Fahid is too young to have a harem.’ ‘He is Prince Narouz's son?’ ‘Nephew.’ ‘The Prince was perhaps showing him the sights?’ ‘What sights?’ ‘Luxor?’ ‘The Prince is not interested in antiquities.’ ‘What, then, was the point of the journey?’ ‘I don't know. Perhaps you had better ask the Prince.’ Mahmoud sighed. He had warned Owen beforehand to expect this. The Prince's entourage wouldn't say anything. He was finding it difficult to extract even the names of the people who had been on the dahabeeyah. ‘Let us go back to the harem,’ he said. ‘How many wives has the Prince?’ ‘Four.’ ‘And they were all there with him?’ ‘Except Latfi, who is having a baby.’ ‘Three, then. There were three in the harem quarters?’ ‘You spoke of wives only.’ ‘There were others, then? How many?’ ‘Seven.’ ‘Can you give me their names?’ said Mahmoud, taking out a pencil and notebook. ‘I am afraid not.’ ‘Are you sure? You knew Latfi's name.’ ‘I know all their names. But it would not be proper for me to tell you the names of His Highness's wives and concubines.’ ‘But I need to know! I am conducting an investigation!’ 'That's as may be, but a man's harem is his own affair.’ 'Not when part of it disappears overboard.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘You know very well what I mean,’ said Mahmoud, exasperated. ‘I told you! His Highness has reported that a passenger on the dahabeeyah with him —’ ‘But she wasn't in the harem.’ ‘She wasn't?’ ‘No!’ ‘What was she doing on board, then?’ ‘Well…’ The eunuch hesitated. ‘You may speak,’ said Owen encouragingly. ‘Mr el Zaki puts these questions with the knowledge and agreement of His Highness,’ possibly stretching the truth a little. ‘She was helping to entertain the princes?’ ‘Helping?’ ‘There were two others. They came on board at Beni Suef.’ ‘On the way up to Luxor or on the way back?’ ‘On the way up.’ ‘Have you any objection to telling me their names?’ ‘I don't know their names,’ said the eunuch. The incident had happened on the return journey. The dahabeeyah had moored for the night and the three girls had been up on the top deck enjoying the evening breeze. They had stayed up there with the princes until it had become dark, early, of course, in Egypt. Prince Narouz, bored, had descended first. About half an hour later, according to the eunuch, Prince Fahid had followed him, accompanied, possibly reluctantly, by two of the girls. The third had remained on the top deck. And it was from the top deck, apparently, that she had disappeared. Late, quite late, someone had called up to her, asking when she was going to come down. Some time after, not having received a reply, they had sent the eunuch to fetch her. He had found the top deck empty. At first he had assumed that she had climbed down to the lower deck and gone forward. Some members of the crew had been sitting in the bows and it was only when they denied having seen her that he began to search seriously. ‘The steersman?’ said Mahmoud. ‘Surely the steersman must have seen?’ On a dahabeeyah the steersman was placed aft, immediately behind the cabin. He usually stood on a little platform raised high enough to enable him to see over and past the cabins when the boat was moving. After the boat had stopped for the night there was always some work still to be done on the platform. The rudder bar had to be lashed and the ropes stowed. The eunuch said, however, that the steersman had finished his work and gone forward before all this happened. The eunuch had made a cursory search and then had reported the matter to Prince Narouz. Narouz had been angry, first with the girl for playing the fool and then with the eunuch for not finding her. He had searched the boat himself. Gradually he came to realize that something was seriously amiss. By now, of course , it was dark and hard to see anything on the water. The Prince had had all the men up on deck  scanning the river with the aid of oil lamps. Meanwhile the eunuch had been concluding a search below. When he had gone up on deck again he found that the Prince had lowered two small rowing boats and was systematically scouring the river. This had continued all night. As soon as it was light the dahabeeyah had sailed down river with everyone on deck keeping an eye out. They had seen nothing. In the end they had abandoned the search, set the Prince down so that he could report the incident at once, and sailed on to Bulak. ‘I shall need to speak to the Ship's Captain, the Rais,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Also to the crew. One by one. Also to the servants. Those girls, of course. Then the harem.’ ‘The harem!’ said the eunuch, shocked. ‘Certainly not! What sort of boat do you think this is?’ The dahabeeyah was moored across the river from the main port. This was the traditional mooring place for dahabeeyahs and in the old days, before Mr Cook had come with his steamers, there would have been over two hundred of them nudging the bank. They were the traditional way for the rich to travel by water — and in Egypt everyone travelled by water. The Nile was the main, the only, thoroughfare from north to south and the dahabeeyah was its Daimler. It was a large, flat-bottomed sailing boat rather like a Thames barge or, as tourists were over-prone to comment, a College houseboat, except that its cabins were all above deck and all aft. This gave it a weird, lop-sided look and might have made it unstable had that not been compensated for by putting the hold forward. From the point of view of the tourist the arrangement had an additional delight. There was a railed-off space on top of the cabins which served as a kind of open-air lounge, sufficiently high to allow passengers both to enjoy the breeze and to see over the bank. This was important, as in some stretches of the river Mr Cook's customers might not  otherwise have benefited from the remarkable views he had promised them. Owen himself rather enjoyed the views but he had been a little surprised to learn that they had also drawn the Prince. ‘How long was he up there?’ he asked the Rais, the Ship's Captain, disbelievingly. ‘Two hours.’ ‘Of course, it was cool up there.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And he was keeping the women company.’ ‘They were already up there,’ said the Rais. There was a note of disapproval in his voice. ‘Really? By themselves?’ Mahmoud clucked sympathetically. ‘By themselves.’ ‘That's not right!’ ‘They shouldn't have been up there at all!’ said the Rais. ‘There's a place for women. And it's the harem.’ ‘Ah, but these weren't — I mean, they weren't properly in the Prince's harem.’ ‘They ought to have been. And they ought to have stayed there.’ ‘Were they flaunting themselves?’ asked Mahmoud, commiserating. The Rais hesitated. ‘It was enough to be there, wasn't it? My men could hardly take their eyes off them.’ ‘Unseemly!’ said Mahmoud. ‘It wasn't proper,’ said the Rais. ‘The Prince should have known better. Though it is not for me to say that.’ ‘Have you captained for him before?’ ‘He's never been on the river before. At least, as far as I know.’ ‘So you didn't know what to expect?’ ‘All he told us was that he wanted to go up to Luxor. With the Prince Fahid. He was very particular about that. The Prince had his own room, of course, and Narouz wanted a cabin next to him. He didn't even want to be with the harem.’ ‘Strange! And then, of course, there were those other women.’ ‘He didn't say anything about them. Not until we were nearly at Beni Suef.’ ‘They were foreigners, weren't they?’ ‘I'm not saying anything.’ ‘They must have been. Our women wouldn't have behaved like that.’ ‘Indecent!’ ‘Did they wear veils?’ ‘They wore veils,’ the Rais conceded grudgingly. ‘But they showed their ankles!’ ‘Oh!’ said Mahmoud, shocked. ‘How could Hassan be expected to steer when they were flaunting their ankles in front of him?’ ‘Impossible,’ Mahmoud agreed. ‘Impossible!’ They were standing in the stern of the vessel looking up at the back of the cabins. The steersman's platform, with the huge horizontal rudder bar he used for steering, was right beside them. ‘But I don't understand!’ said Mahmoud. ‘The woman who stayed up there alone —’ ‘Shameless!’ said the Rais. ‘Shameless!’ agreed Mahmoud. ‘But she was right in front of him. Surely he would have seen if she had — well, fallen off.’ ‘Ah, but it was dark, you see. We had stopped for the night.’ ‘So the steersman wasn't there?’ ‘No.’ ‘Where was he?’ ‘I don't know,’ said the Rais. ‘You'd better ask him.’ ‘And where were you?’ asked Mahmoud. ‘I was up here,’ said the steersman. ‘We'd finished  for the day, so I tied the rudder and then came up forward.’ They were sitting in the shade of the cook's galley. It was a small shed, rather like a Dutch oven in shape, set well up into the prow to remove it as far as possible from the passengers' cabins. The cook stood up on the forward side, so that the shed protected him when there was a favourable wind. They could hear him there now. The spot was clearly a favourite one with the crew and there had been several men dozing there when Owen and Mahmoud had appeared. They had gone aft to leave them to talk to the steersman in private, but one of them, the cook presumably, had disappeared into the galley. ‘She was still up there at that point?’ ‘Yes.’ The steersman's wrinkled face broke into a smile. ‘I reckoned the midges would soon drive her down.’ ‘It was dark by then?’ ‘Just. They were up there admiring the sunset but I wanted to stop while there was still a bit of light. There are one or two things you have to do and you can always do them better if you can see what you're doing. Besides, the Prince didn't want us to go too far. He wanted another night on the river!’ ‘Oh, he did, did he? And why was that?’ ‘Why do you think? Perhaps he likes it better on the water.’ ‘That's what is was about, you think?’ ‘What else could it be? He goes down to his estate and doesn't stay there a moment, we call in at Luxor and he doesn't want to go ashore. We go straight down and straight back and the only thing we stop for is to pick up some women at Beni Suef!’ ‘Those women,’ said Mahmoud, ‘what were they like?’ ‘Classy. But not the sort you'd want to take home with you.’ ‘Foreign.’ The steersman hesitated. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘I don't know. Two of them were, certainly. The other — that's the one who finished up in the river — I'm not sure about.’ ‘You're sure about the others, though?’ ‘Oh yes. You could hear them talking. Mind you, she was talking with them. I don't know, of course, but it just seemed to me…well, and then there were the clothes.’ ‘What about the clothes?’ ‘Well, they all wore the tob.’ The tob was a loose outer gown. ‘And the burka, of course.’ The burka was a long face veil which reached almost to the ground. ‘But from where I was you could see their legs.’ ‘Yes. The Rais told us.’ ‘I'll bet he did! He oughtn't to have seen that, ought he? I mean, he wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't been looking. You'd have thought a man like that, strict, he's supposed to be —’ ‘The women,’ said Mahmoud patiently. ‘Yes, well, the thing was that — I mean, I couldn't see clearly — but I reckon those two had European clothes on underneath their tobs. You could see their ankles. But the other one, well, I caught a glimpse. She was wearing shintiyan.’ ‘Pink ones?’ said Owen. ‘Why, yes,’ said the steersman, surprised. ‘That's right. How did you know? Oh, I suppose you've seen the body.’ ‘Never mind that,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Let's get back to when she was on the top deck. She was up there when you last saw her?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Alone?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Why didn't she go down with the others?’ ‘I don't know.’ ‘Had they been quarrelling?’ ‘I don't know.’ ‘You heard them talking.’ ‘Well, it was not so much quarrelling. I think the Prince  was trying to get her to do something. Like, persuade her.’ ‘And she didn't want to?’ ‘I couldn't really tell,’ confessed the steersman. ‘I couldn't understand the language, see? It was just the impression I got. He wasn't nasty or anything, not even angry, really. He was just trying — well, to persuade her, like I said.’ ‘He didn't get anywhere, though?’ ‘No.’ ‘How was she? I mean, was she angry?’ ‘I couldn't really say. You never know what's going on behind those burkas. You think all's going well and the next moment — bing! They've hit you with something. My wife's like that.’ ‘Were there any tears?’ ‘Tears? Well, I don't know. Not so much tears but you know how they get sometimes, you think they're going to cry and they don't, they just keep going on and on. A bit like that.’ ‘With the Prince? When he was trying to persuade her?’ ‘Yes. And with the girls, too. A bit earlier. Going on and on.’ ‘Did they get fed up with her?’ ‘They left her alone after a bit. Then the Prince came up and had a try and he didn't do any better.’ He broke off. ‘Is this helping?’ he asked. ‘Yes.’ ‘Good. I like to help. Only — all this talking!’ He suddenly pounded on the back of the galley with his fist. ‘What's the matter?’ asked the cook, sticking his head out. ‘How about some tea? I'm so dry I can't speak.’ ‘It sounded to me as if you were doing all right. I'd have brought you some before only I didn't want to interrupt you.’ He placed a little white enamel cup before each of them and filled it with strong black tea. ‘No sugar,’ he said. ‘You'd think we'd have sugar on board the Prince's dahabeeyah but we don't.’ ‘It's that eunuch,’ said the steersman. ‘The stuff never even gets here.’ ‘It goes somewhere else, does it?’ asked Mahmoud sympathetically. ‘Into his pocket!’ said the steersman. Mahmoud looked up at the cook. ‘You were here that night, weren't you? The night the girl disappeared?’ ‘Yes. I was just making supper when that stupid eunuch came along making a great commotion.’ ‘You left the girl there,’ Mahmoud said to the steersman, ‘and then you came along here. Did you have a cup of tea at that point?’ ‘Yes,’ said the steersman, ‘I always have one when I finish.’ ‘Tea first, then supper,’ said the cook. ‘And you had a cup with him, perhaps?’ ‘I did. I always do.’ ‘Here? Sitting here?’ ‘Yes. Several of us.’ ‘And you were still sitting here when the eunuch came?’ 'l was,’said the steersman. ‘I had just got up,’ said the cook. ‘To make the supper.’ 'So whatever it was that happened,’ said Mahmoud, ‘happened while you were sitting here.’ ‘I suppose so,’ said the steersman. ‘Well, it must have.’ 'Yes, it must have. And you still say you saw nothing? Heard nothing?’ ‘Here, just a minute —!’ ‘We weren't looking!’ ‘We were talking!’ ‘You would have seen a person. Or —’ ‘We didn't see anything!’ ‘Two people. On the cabin roof. Together.’ ‘Here!’ said the steersman, scrambling to his feet. ‘What are you saying?’ ‘I'm asking,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Did you see two people?’ ‘No!’ ‘Up there together. Whoever they were.’ ‘I didn't see anything!’ ‘None of us saw anything!’ ‘Thirty feet away and you saw nothing?’ ‘We weren't looking!’ ‘You took care not to look.’ ‘We were talking!’ ‘And nothing attracted your attention? Someone is attacked —’ ‘Attacked!’ ‘Or falls. And you know nothing about it? If she'd jumped into the water she'd have made a splash.’ ‘A splash? Who hears a splash? There are splashes all the time.’ ‘One as big as this? You are boatmen. You would have heard.’ ‘Truly!’ said the steersman. ‘I swear to God —!’ ‘He hears what you say!’ Mahmoud warned him. ‘And sees all that happens. I know. Well, he may have seen what happened to the girl but I didn't.’ The steersman showed them off the boat. At the gangway he hesitated and then ran up the bank after them. ‘What was it, then? Was she knocked on the head?’ ‘I don't know,’ said Mahmoud. ‘I thought you'd seen the body?’ ‘No. It's not turned up yet.’ ‘Oh.’ He seemed disappointed. Then he brightened. ‘Tell you what,’ he said, ‘I know where it will fetch up, more than likely.’ ‘Yes?’ The steersman pointed downriver to where men were working on a scaffolding which stretched out across the river. ‘See that? That's the new Bulak bridge. That's where they finish up these days.’ They were sharing the boat with a kid goat, a pile of onions and the boatman's wife, who sat, completely muffled in tob and burka, as far away from them as was possible. It had been the steersman's idea. They had been about to set out for the main bridge when he had said: ‘Are you going back to Bulak? Why don't you get Hamid to run you over?’ He had pointed along the bank to where an elderly Arab was standing in the water bent over the gunwale of a small, crazily-built boat. The sides were not so much planks as squares of wood stuck on apparently at hazard. The sail was a small, tattered square sheet. ‘In that? I don't think so,’ said Owen. But Mahmoud, fired with enthusiasm for the life marine, was already descending the bank. With the two of them on board, the stern dipped until the gunwale was inches above the water. The bows, with the woman and the goat, rose heavenward. The boatman inspected this critically for a moment, but then, unlike Owen, seemed satisfied. He perched himself on the edge of the gunwale and took the two ends of the rope in his hands. One he wedged expertly between his toes. The other he wound round his arm. The wind caught the sail and he threw himself backwards until the folds of his galabeah were trailing in the water. The boat moved comfortably out into the river. Now they were in midstream they could see the new bridge more clearly. There were workmen on the scaffolding and, down at the bottom, a small boat nudging its way along the length of the works. The boatman pointed with his head. ‘That's the police boat,’ he said. ‘It comes every day to pick up the bodies.’ ‘Can you take us over there?’ asked Mahmoud. The boatman scampered across to the opposite gunwale, turned the boat, turned it again and set off on a long glide which took them close in along the bridge. ‘Bring us in to the boat,’ said Mahmoud. A tall man in the police boat looked up, saw Mahmoud and waved excitedly. ‘Ya Mahmoud!’ he called. ‘Ya Selim!’ answered Mahmoud warmly. A couple of policemen caught the boat as it came in alongside and steadied it. Mahmoud and the other man embraced affectionately. ‘Why, Mahmoud, have you done something sensible at last and joined the river police?’ ‘Temporarily; this is my boat.’ Selim inspected it critically. ‘The boatman's all right,’ he said, ‘but I'm not so sure about the boat.’ He shook hands with the boatman. ‘Give me your money,’ said the boatman, ‘and I'll have a boat as good as yours.’ ‘And the Mamur Zapt,’ said Mahmoud. Selim shook hands again and gave him a second look. ‘I don't think we've met,’ said Owen. ‘No. I've met Mahmoud, though. We were working on a case last year.’ He looked at them again. ‘The Mamur Zapt and the Parquet,’ he said. ‘This must be important.’ ‘It's the girl,’ said Mahmoud. ‘You've received notification, I'm sure.’ ‘Pink shintiyan? That the one?’ ‘That's the one.’ ‘Not come through yet. When did it happen?’ ‘The night before last. About three miles upstream.’ ‘She'll have sunk, then. Otherwise she'd have come through by now.’ Owen looked out along the works. There seemed a lot of water passing through the gaps. ‘Could she have gone through and missed you?’ ‘She could. But most of them finish up against the scaffolding. In the old days before we started building the bridge they used to fetch up on a bend about two miles down. That was better for us because it's in the next district and meant they had to do the work and not us.’ ‘Ah, but that meant they missed all the glory, too!’ ‘I think the average Chief would prefer to do without the glory!’ Owen laughed. ‘We've known a few like that!’ ‘Yes. We sometimes get the feeling that not all the bodies that come down to us need have done.’ ‘You think so?’ ‘Sure of it.’ ‘It's important to pick up this one,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Yes, I'm checking them myself. We've had two women through this week. One of them's old and one of them's young, but I don't think the young one could be the one you're looking for, not unless she changed her trousers on the way down.’ ‘The trousers is about all we've got at the moment. I hope to add some details later. Keep the young one just in case. ‘It'll be some time before she's traced and identified anyway. They don't always come from the city. Sometimes it's a village upstream.’ ‘Well, keep her. Just on the off-chance.’ ‘If she's sunk, what then?’ asked Owen. ‘Oh, she'll come up. Gases. In the body. It'll take a day or two. Then the body comes up and floats on down to us. We get them all in the end.’ ‘I hope you get this one.’ They pushed off. Their boat was now downwind and they had to tack. The boatman tucked up the skirts of his galabeah, hooked his knees over the gunwale and leaned far back over the side. Owen, more confident of his transport now, trailed a hand over the side and turned his face  to catch the breeze. Beside him, Mahmoud, hands clasped behind head, was thinking. In the bows the boatman's wife sat muffled from head to foot, invisible behind her veil, anonymous."
FIC FIC-K8V-008 8.09 "Ten He became aware of the consequences to himself the next day. He got into his office early. He had plenty of work to do there. Even as he sat down, almost as if he was expected, the telephone rang. ‘Hello?’ ‘Jordan here.’ He was already beginning to think of Jordan as a kind of spiritual weevil or mouse in his woodwork. So he waited. ‘Haven't seen much of you these last few days.’ ‘Been busy,’ he said cautiously. None of this was real conversation. ‘Still looking for your lost relations?’ ‘A bit of that, too.’ He had thought little of his lost sibling this last day or two. ‘Been seeing Rose Hilaire?’ Dead silence on both sides while Coffin worked it out. ‘Contact made for the first time last night. Who was watching?’ ‘Not watching. Sometimes observations are made, that's all.’ ‘Was it necessary? Who's put you up to this call? Someone's told you to talk to me.’ ‘I'm doing it off my own bat. John. Give Rose Hilaire a miss. Stay away from her.’ ‘What are you doing to me?’ ‘Giving good advice. Look what there is against her.’ There was a dead silence from Coffin's end of the line, but Jordan, a trier if there ever was one, pressed on. ‘It was her house. Originally. She had access. Probably kept a key.’ He had a point there, his reluctant listener admitted, Rose probably had kept a key. Any woman would. Jordan must have felt that he had made a dent, he went on relentless. ‘I happen to know that the forensic boys have found traces on Ephraim Humphreys's clothes of fabrics and materials from the Hilaire household. Wood and cotton shreds, paint flakes that match.’ Happen to know is good, thought Coffin. ‘What about the other bodies, then?’ Silence for a bit, so there was nothing on them, as there would not be in the normal way of life since Ephraim Humphreys had been a friend of Steve Hilaire's and they, presumably, had not. A plus for Rose and Steve. ‘You can't overlook the boots,’ said Jordan. ‘Rose Hilaire is trouble. And her son too, if I'm any judge of character. Leave that pair alone. I've seen a lot of good coppers ruined that way. And you are a good one, John.’ Not a mouse in the woodwork, or a spiritual weevil, Coffin decided as he put the receiver down, but the voice of conscience. Probably Jordan hadn't really spoken at all, he was a kind of doppelganger telling Coffin not only what he ought to do, but what he also knew. The other half of him speaking, the half that knew it ought to run. He and Jordan had known each other for some years, had worked together side by side on a case of armed robbery, and been friends. But friends who eyed each other all the time, not exactly with envy, but with care to see who got ahead. The patronage of the big man Dander had edged Coffin ahead (not unnoticed by his friend), but then Jordan had made a prudent and happy marriage with the only child of a chief superintendent. In a way each admired the other's skill at living, while enjoying the odd false step. In the world where Rose Hilaire and Belmodes moved rumours ran around quickly. Very soon her competitors in their showrooms on the other side of Oxford Street or in the side streets off Bond Street knew that she was in trouble. Some sort of trouble, the exact nature was not precisely clear, but the word murder began to creep in. The story about a whole bloodstained cupboard being removed from Belmodes to a police laboratory went the rounds with the speed of light, being especially well received at Teddy Touch's outfit, marketing street clothes known as Touchline. Belmodes was not as big as most of the firms concerned, but Rose was regarded with respect as ‘quality’. She had an eye for talent which they respected, she knew how to pick her designers, and could be relied on to spot a trend developing and to promote it. Never original, they knew that, they respected her position in the market-place. But, of course, it would be delightful if she took a fall. The competitors in the fashion world watched  each other closely always, for any sign of faltering. They were on a roundabout, anyway, or if you preferred the image, a swing. Sometimes you were up, sometimes you were down, the thing was to keep swinging and not fall off. As it was only too easy to do. They remembered with joy when Alberta Monterecchio went in for culotte suits in satin, velvet and even leather, just when the mini skirt was appearing. The clothes were applauded on the cat-walk, but stayed in the racks. Ordinary women seemed to know instinctively that from the hip down (and especially from behind) culottes produced an unflattering outline, the mini won hands down. Then Alberta disappeared, to reappear some time later, working for a wholesaler selling through catalogues. There had been other collapses, there were little ones all the time, and big ones too like the ‘Tim and Teddy’ shops' rapid demise (which had been simply because of their slovenly accounting), but Rose had a special place. She was genuine, by which they meant she paid her bills in good time, and employed union labour. Belmodes had been around a long time. Rose was the second generation in it, and she had taken it from a back street operation to a small, high class chain. But murder? The word was passed around, rapidly, almost secretly, like a small valuable coin. Calculation began at once. The first sign of this was two approaches to Gabriel for her services; one disguised as a joking phone call, the other as a polite invitation to lunch, but both real. She knew they were real. Gabriel understood the  ways of her world. She saw at once what was happening to her and to Rose, and where it could lead them both. She could read the geography of a life with the best. She put the telephone receiver down on the invitation to lunch with a quiet face, but an excited heart. ‘What was that?’ ‘Nothing, Rose.’ ‘I don't like personal calls in work hours.’ ‘It was about an order, Rose,’ said Gabriel smoothly. They wouldn't fight now, not those two, but the battle would be continued at a time and place of their own choosing. Both women went back to work. Gabriel, troubled yet excited. The evening before she had talked about Rose to Charley; she couldn't believe Rose was a murderer. ‘Plenty of women murderers,’ he had answered, this was one of his subjects. Madeleine Smith, Mrs Merrifield, and Mrs Christofix only last year. Rose was worried. They won't arrest me or Steve, she thought. Lack of evidence, surely. Or is there? What could they have found? She worried away at the problem. Questions biting at her like rats, ending up with the sharpest bite of all. They don't hang women for murder any more, no more Ruth Ellises. No one hangs. But life imprisonment? The thought was terrifying to one whose whole being was devoted to the outer show. Rose moved around her factory aware all the time of the undercurrents from the women working there. A good many had worked there for years, some going back to the days of her grandfather. Army uniforms they'd made then, with a percentage of Utility clothes. But Rose knew that wily Grandpa had quietly saved enough cloth to make a few high quality, black market clothes. Not much profit came from these transactions but friends were made and contacts kept up that were to prove useful in the peace. Rose knew that she had built on the foundations well and truly laid by Grandpa. Bombed out of one small premises, Grandpa had moved from factory to factory, finally ending up in what was now Belmodes. Up all the way. There had been a brief downturn when her husband, a disaster if there ever was one, had been general manager. His ideas of management (which had involved business lunches, a Rolls with expensive chauffeur, and a succession of pretty secretaries), had nearly brought them to bankruptcy. Nevertheless, it was during this period, just after her son was born, when Rose had opened her first shop. Out of a lot of misery, she created a beginning. That was fighting. She was fighting now as she moved about the work floor. Belmodes was busy. In the main factory, heads were bent over the new German sewing-machines in which Rose had recently invested. Money well spent, the girls liked using them. She called them girls but many were women whose working days went back to the Utility dresses and khaki battle-dress. She had inherited a loyal staff along with the business. But she had to keep them loyal. In these days of full employment any one of the skilled women could  find a job elsewhere easily. In this area a number of small clothing-manufacturers had set themselves up since the war, migrating out from the East End of London. At the end of the war there had been a lot of money-grants for reconstruction as well as tax concessions. Grandpa had not been the only one who grabbed. Lily Bates was back at work, Rose could see her unmistakable small figure with her shock of grey hair quickly moving a flow of green jersey through her machine. She was a good worker. One of the best. Dagmar silently appeared at Rose's elbow. ‘Bad storm last night,’ said Rose absently, her gaze yet on Lily, her thoughts ever on her own trouble. ‘Sorry I sounded off yesterday. I was worried about Steve.’ Still was, for that matter. ‘He gets under my skin sometimes.’ ‘You worry about him too much.’ ‘I don't.’ That was true. Steve had earned every ounce of worry she expended on him. Probably there were depths to worry about in him she had not even plumbed. Occasionally with him she had the sense she was going down through a hole in the floor. ‘How is he today?’ ‘He went to school. I drove him there.’ And watched him walk inside, and sat in the car watching for ten minutes to see that he stayed. ‘It was brave of him really.’ If it was courage, his face had expressed indifference, but his back had conveyed desperation, while he had slid through the door with his body touching the wall. If posture and where you put your body  meant anything (and she had heard sociologists say it did), Steve had a strong desire not to be seen. ‘I shall collect him at the end of the day. I think that's best, don't you?’ ‘Still taking off at intervals, is he?’ With certain reservations, Dagmar was in Rose's confidence. ‘Sort of.’ ‘Ever think of having him followed?’ ‘How?’ ‘You could get a detective. Hire one.’ Dagmar came up with some practical suggestions sometimes. It was a good idea. But she had a detective now: Coffin. ‘Don't you think the police are doing that?’ ‘But they aren't going to tell you, are they?’ ‘No.’ Or not yet. Perhaps never. Or possibly in a court of justice. ‘I'll think about it.’ ‘If anyone's brave, it's you. Brave of you to come here today.’ ‘Thank you, Dagmar.’ Dagmar was a real pain sometimes, coming out with things you'd rather not have said. ‘But I had to keep an eye on things.’ There were a lot of important orders on hand. One of the things that distinguished Belmodes from its rivals was the small chain of shops Rose herself had launched. In them the racks and shelves were filled with clothes made in the factory here. Very, very rarely did she buy in, and if she did, then it was a line of expensive Italian knitwear, or silk shirts from Braganza in Spain. Something special to catch the eye, and never much of it; thus was not money made, and Rose knew it. Money was made by long runs of dresses successfully sold. So her shops with their carefully designed clothes sat on top of great orders for dresses and suits that Belmodes made for a handful of big stores who marketed them under different trade names, sometimes their own, but never Belmodes. Usually those clothes were made to toiles selected by the store's own designers. Two such big orders for winter suits were in the make now. They had been much on Rose Hilaire's mind because the buyer from one store, Morgan's of Leeds, had shown signs of wanting to move away to a manufacturer offering lower costs. Rose, whose own profits were already cut to the bone to get the order, knew that she was on trial. If Morgan's left, the others might follow. She guessed that the alternative manufacturer must be deliberately making a loss to get the contract. Belmodes must get its order out on time and impeccably finished. She was checking the finish for herself, not a job she usually did, but today it was soothing to her nerves. Because the work was good. Very good. ‘This is nice, Lily,’ she said; she had arrived at Lily Bates's machine, and the words popped out before she could stop them. Niceness and Lily's cruel life at the moment hardly seemed to go. Nor with her own miseries, come to that. ‘What I mean, Lily, is I'm pleased with the work. Thank you for coming in. It's decent of you.’ She had been surprised to see Lily there. ‘I came because I need the money.’ Lily did not raise her head from her work. ‘You know you'd be paid.’ Rose was hurt. She had her own ideas of social justice, and not paying a good employee like Lily because of a death in the family was not one of them. ‘I should trust you, eh?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘But I don't. Not any more. Not anyone till I know who killed Ephraim.’ Rose perched on a stool so that her face was on a level with Lily and the woman had to look at her. ‘I too don't trust anyone.’ And then, delicately, as if it was something she hardly wanted to admit to, ‘Much.’ ‘Do you think they will want me to identify Ephraim?’ ‘No, Lily.’ Though someone would have to do the job. But the child had parents. It was for them. ‘I'd go. It ought to be me. I'd be best. I asked to see him, but they said no.’ Rose was silent, only too aware that the whole workroom was listening to them. Lily knew, too. The girls are all pretty unhappy.’ ‘I know it, Lily.’ Lily's machine continued to whirr, her experienced hands doing their task automatically. ‘They wouldn't walk out, would they?’ Lily was silent. ‘I see.’ Rats leaving a sinking ship; she felt sick. So they were thinking of it. ‘Plenty of work around elsewhere, you see.’ ‘It would be bad for me.’ ‘They don't like the atmosphere, you see.’ Who did? thought Rose. ‘They think — well, the truth is they don't what to think. Nor do I.’ ‘I didn't do it, Lily.’ ‘But you might know who did,’ said Lily in a voice. ‘I'm not saying you do, but you might.’ ‘Nor does Steve,’ said Rose with difficulty. Lily was silent. ‘Oh, damn it all,’ said Rose. ‘It's like being caught up on a bit of barbed wire.’ Like on a battlefield. ‘And you and I are on it together, Lily. Whether we like it or not, we are.’ And I'm screaming with pain. ‘If it makes things easier for you I won t come in.’ You never knew who your friends were. ‘No, you keep coming in.’ She gave Lily's shoulder a pat. ‘But thanks.’ She moved away, half comforted, half deeply concerned at Lily's information. She felt she could not bear to continue her inspection. There seemed no point when the whole place might be on the point of closing, and she herself and Steve in prison. Gabriel would go, all the sewing-room would go. Dagmar would stay, and probably Ted Tipper. They were the sort that hung on. From mixed motives, if she knew them. She walked towards her office, plenty to do there which might take her mind off these worries by substituting others. There was a letter from her bank manager that had a nasty look to it. In fact, any other time it would probably have terrified her, now she  rather welcomed it as a sign that life was normal after all. The main door stood wide open making a through draught. A faint smell of Deller's factory floated in, the air nicely spiced with the usual scent of smouldering rubber that was being burnt somewhere. It was such an everyday smell that Rose hardly noticed it. She closed her eyes and leant against the wall waiting for the wave of dizziness to subside. She knew now she was not pregnant, but she was heavy with apprehension. A car approached, stopped, a door slammed. Rose opened her eyes. She saw a man and a woman walking towards the factory. She had no difficulty in recognizing the man as one of the policemen who had hovered around her and Steve. She had never heard his name. Without conscious volition, she backed into her office and stood behind the door. There was a mirror above in whose reflection she saw Ted Tipper advance down the corridor and meet face to face with the police. She could see him. Didn't that mean he could see her? She shifted her position slightly. When you are on the outside looking in, the ways of the police can seem frightening and strange. These two seemed like an invasion force. She wished she could ring up John Coffin to ask what they wanted. They had stayed talking very late last night, and he knew a lot more about her than she had ever expected to tell anyone, while she knew something about him. She liked him. To herself she had to admit that she would have been willing to go further than talk. Perhaps  it had been the vodka working. But he had seemed to draw back. No doubt he was wise. He seemed a man who understood her. The only way he had let her down was about her nightmare. He had listened to her telling him. In fact, she thought he had listened more than once, she had been repeating herself. The vodka again, no doubt. But at the end he had said to her soberly that it was imagination. Funny sort of imagination, like nothing she had met with before, pulling her inside out like a pair of gloves. Ted Tipper and the invading army had met. Ted was already in a bad mood. The removal of the cupboard and the sealing up of the women's rest-room had seriously complicated his life. He had had to give up his own little hidey-hole in the stockroom to clear a space for them to hang their coats. Even his lavatory was now reserved for them. ‘What do you two want? Why do you always come round in pairs? Why can't you treat us like human beings?’ ‘Mrs Bates here? I was told she was.’ ‘This worries me. Rose knew Ted in this mood: he remembered that he was the son of a man who had been dresser to George Robey, and grandson of a woman who had known Crippen. She came out of her room. ‘I'm Mrs Hilaire. What is it you want?’ The policeman either knew his way around or had been briefed, because he had already moved in the  direction of the workrooms, followed by an angry Ted Tipper muttering about the bloody police. The woman police officer and Rose faced each other. ‘Is it to identify the boy?’ All she got in reply was a smile and a shake of the head. ‘Ask Sergeant Davis.’ Lily appeared through the swing doors with Sergeant Davis, shrugging herself into her coat as she came. ‘I'll come with you.’ Rose spoke up quickly. ‘You're the last person I'd want.’ ‘Let me go,’ said Gabriel, suddenly appearing. Sergeant Davis looked at the woman detective. ‘Come on, Gillian.’ Rose intervened. ‘Wait a minute. Why Lily? Why not the mother? Or if not the mother, then the stepfather?’ Sergeant Davis said, unemotionally, ‘The mother says it is not Ephraim. Cannot be, because she has had a message from a clairvoyant that her son is alive and well and living in Wapping. We can't trust to that, Mrs Hilaire. His stepfather thinks it might be the boy. Might not. We believe he knows it is, but can't bring himself to admit it. That's why, Mrs Hilaire.’ He looked at the policewoman. Gillian put a soothing hand on Lily's arm. ‘It's only a formal identification, Mrs Bates. We'll make it as easy as we can for you. Just a quick look. The clothes will do it, probably.’ Lily jerked away. ‘I shall know what to do. I'll pay my respects to him without you telling me to take a  quick look. I've laid them out in my time. I know what death is.’ Sergeant Davis gave Gillian Murphy a quick, sharp look. ‘All right, Mrs Bates,’ she said. ‘We'll do it your way. ‘And I don't want you,’ said Lily to Gabriel. ‘Sorry. Only trying to help.’ ‘Come on, my dear.’ Gillian led her out to the waiting car. Gabriel and Rose watched Lily's back. Unconsciously they had moved together as if for support. ‘I'm glad she's gone,’ said Davis. ‘There's a bit more to it than an identification.’ Rose waited. ‘Mrs Bates won't come back here. We shall be taking her home. Be taking a look at her house.’ She'll need someone with her.’ ‘Not you, Mrs Hilaire.’ Rose looked at him, scenting a mixture of threat and impertinence. ‘Because we still need you here,’ went on Davis easily. ‘A forensic team need to have a look round. With your permission, of course.’ Fear took a firm grip on Rose's stomach. ‘Why? You've inspected the washroom, taken away a cupboard, photographed all over the place.’ ‘Can I just say we need to do it? We know what we are looking for. ‘I don't know, though. What is it?’ ‘And don't worry about Mrs Bates,’ he went on, ignoring her question. ‘I promise you we will look after her. We shall see she's all right.’ ‘When will you be here?’ ‘Can't say precisely, Mrs Hilaire. You understand our difficulties. But you'll get a phone call.’ ‘And how long will it take? I've got several big orders to get out.’ Rose was getting frantic. ‘We'll do our best; we won't get in your way more than we can help.’ ‘And what does that mean?’ ‘It means as much as I can make it mean.’ Which means precisely nothing, Rose thought. Sergeant Davis had managed to conduct the whole conversation nicely balanced on an edge between politeness and aggression. He frightened Rose. She wanted to hit him, and she knew he knew she wanted to. If this was the new breed of policeman, she didn't like it. His hair was on the long side too, and she was almost sure he bleached the ends. ‘Oh, and Mrs Hilaire, one other thing, the message is we may need to see your own place. Where you live, I mean. Riverwalk, isn't it?’ ‘Yes,’ said Rose uneasily. The hand was now gripping even harder at the centre she called her terror spot. She was beginning to think her heart was involved. Certainly something was banging away painfully inside her and causing her trouble in breathing. Gabriel, silent all this time, moved to her side. ‘Are you all right?’ ‘Mrs Hilaire?’ said Davis questioningly. ‘I'm upset, that's all! What is it you want from where I live? What are you looking for?’ ‘I can't answer that because I don't know.’ She didn't believe him. ‘But once again, I promise the whole job will be done as expeditiously as possible.’ ‘But what's it to do with?’ ‘It's to do with a death, Mrs Hilaire, the death of a boy. It looks as though the body was moved before it was buried. At least once, perhaps twice.’ At last she had extracted a picture from him. A picture of a boy being strangled, then stabbed. Of that boy being moved, and hidden in the cupboard in the washroom in Belmodes, then moved again to the house in Mouncy Street. A house she had once owned. Somewhere in all the moves the body contriving to lose its boots which then turned up in Steve's bag at school. It all chimed in horribly with that waking vision of hers. Whichever way you looked, the Hilaires were right in it. Now all she wanted was for him to go, so she could sit down and think it over. It might be sensible to get a solicitor. She could see she was at the point where the police might be going to do some hard questioning. ‘Goodbye, Sergeant. I'll be ready.’ By a miracle she kept her voice steady. Gabriel followed her into her office. ‘They must have some reason for all this,’ she said uneasily. ‘Something they've discovered. On the body or about the body.’ ‘Oh, shut up,’ said Rose wearily. ‘Go away and send Dagmar in.’ ‘Look, I won't deny we've had differences of opinion. That's style. Our styles don't match. But when it comes down to it, women protect women.’ ‘Oh, do you think so?’ Rose laughed. ‘Can't say I've met it.’ ‘I'm the new sort of woman. Women against men. This is the 1960s. I'm on your side.’ ‘Thanks. I'd still like to have Dagmar.’ ‘He was bloody to you, that man.’ ‘I'm the goat in this business, Gaby. There's always a goat; the one that's going to get its throat cut. You're from Paradise Street, you ought to know about that.’ ‘Come on now, Rose.’ ‘The goat doesn't know it at first, but learns. I'm learning.’ Her voice took on energy. ‘Well, this goat's not going to be an easy sacrifice.’ She reached out a hand for the telephone. ‘This goat's going to get help. I'm calling my solicitor.’ With one hand she was searching through her address book. ‘Damn. Dagmar? Are you there?’ What's the telephone number of Fiddlestone's, the solicitors in New Cross Road?’ ‘Old Mr Fiddle has not been there for some time, Rose,’ said Dagmar from the door. ‘What happened to him? Did he go to prison or die? I always wondered which judgement seat would get him first.’ ‘He died. Heart. Just came out of the Magistrates Court and dropped down dead. He'd won his case, though. There's an Indian gentleman running things now. Greenwich 8992.’ ‘Well, he'll do for me,’ said Rose decisively. ‘What's up?’ ‘You tell her, Gaby, and remember to cut out the philosophy.’ Rose was dialling the Greenwich number. Gabriel outlined what they knew, and what was coming to them. She felt involved, the cloud that hung over Rose hung over her, too. As one of her companions on the last CND march had said, ‘When the bomb drops you can't say: This had nothing to do with me.’ After this the woman had gone on to attack her wearing feminine clothes, and somehow after that, Gabriel, although liking the woman (called Karen, whom she had gone on knowing) and still believing you should Ban the Bomb, had never gone on another march. Rose finished her conversation and put the receiver down. ‘Nice voice.’ She sounded reassured. ‘He said nothing I can do, so to let the police in. But to say nothing, remember that, you two, and I've got an appointment to see him later today. Perhaps we should all go.’ ‘I don't see that,’ said Gabriel: the cloud was getting too close. ‘And you might tell Charley: the police will be over his place, too. Bound to be, as it's more or less part of this.’ ‘He won't like that.’ Rose ignored this. ‘And the solicitor will find out what's going on. He says he has good relations with the police.’ ‘That'll appear on the bill,’ said Dagmar sourly, the ever-cynical voice of Paradise Street. ‘I don't suppose he'll bribe them.’ Dagmar laughed. ‘There are ways. And you are Ted Mosse's niece.’ ‘I need to know what's going on. They've got some evidence somewhere that's worrying them. Or if not worrying them, then alerting them. They will be looking for something special. What? I'd like to know what they are looking for.’ ‘They won't tell,’ said Dagmar. Rose had an idea; she gave Gabriel a meaning look. ‘We both know a policeman.’ ‘Not his case,’ said Gabriel. Not his case, but he was in it himself, stuck like a fly. He had taken a phone call from Gabriel, half wishing it was Rose Hilaire, but wanting to feel loyal to Gaby. What a funny, pretty voice she had on the telephone. ‘How did you get through to me?’ he asked curiously. ‘I just kept on asking until they found you.’ ‘Well, you did it.’ He was surprised all the same; he had been working on a case which, while not exactly undercover, was one demanding some secrecy. No one was supposed to know where he was operating from. Clearly they did. ‘Where are you talking from?’ ‘Belmodes. Rose's office. Where are you talking from?’ She could hear the sound of voices and laughter, even music. ‘A club. A kind of a club.’ In fact it was a pub down in Deptford, down by the Surrey Docks, where he was a friend of the landlord, using his back room as  a base. A side door led straight into a street. It was a safe house in a bad area at a bad time. He was living on two levels at that time. One part of him, the professional Sergeant, soon to be Inspector, John Coffin engaged in a complicated, difficult, frustrating case which involved organized crime in dockland. It was an investigation which contrived to be both terrifying and boring at the same time. If crime could ever be boring. You got such insights into other people's lives. Even now he had learnt that Pete Foster, the man being investigated for murder and fraud in the Docks, a hard man, was terrified of his old mother and had kept his successful career in crime hidden from her for sixteen years. She thought he was a chimney-sweep. You learnt about yourself, too. He was always learning. Last night he had discovered something about himself, and, as it happened, something about Rose Hilaire. He moved his shoulder experimentally; still sore. That had been part of the learning process. After midnight, taking his careful, indirect route home from his dockside rendezvous, he had met two men. One had slipped out of an alley in front of him; he saw the glint of a knife. Then a blow hit his shoulder, felling him to the ground. Stay in character, he told himself. Stay in character. Three months had gone in establishing his pseudo-self as a friendless, cowardly drunk. He remembered giving a high scream: he was not proud of that noise, he hadn't thought he had it in him, but it had come out easily. His face had gone into something soft that his nose  told him was dog dirt. A hand pushed him further into the dirt; a voice had said: ‘Just listen; you don't know me, but I know you.’ To his surprise, it was a woman's voice. ‘I know you want Pete Foster, we'll do a trade. I'll give you Foster if you get Joe Landau for me.’ Coffin must have moved because the pressure on him increased. ‘You'll do him for me because I ask and because he's a lousy, rotten drug-pusher. I've got family reasons for hating him. He's corrupted someone I care for.’ He had sat up then, and they had negotiated. He had not seen her face, which she kept covered with a scarf, but he thought he could put a name to her. At the end of a few minutes, he had agreed to get Landau, and she had come up with the names of banks and accounts for both Foster and Landau, and the place where he could lay hands on Pete Foster. As he had finally got back to Mrs Lorimer's and was washing his face, he was wondering how much of the dirty water of the drug scene had washed over Rose and Steve. He thought it had done. That was one John Coffin, perhaps the better man of the two. The other Coffin, the owner of the house in Mouncy Street, the almost-lover of two ladies, Gabriel and Rose, was living with greater intensity, even if only part-time. This part-timer worked, as part-timers will do, with devotion. Thinking all the deeper for not being able to concentrate full time on the bodies in Mouncy Street. Three of them now, all adolescent boys. He did not as yet know all the details of how they  had died, and what had gone before, but rumour had it that no great physical strength had been involved so that you could not rule out a woman as the killer. Or a child. Or a puny man who would kill but did not choose to use too much force. Rumours had it also that there had been a little bit of nasty business first. Sex-play plus torture. So you were looking for a psycho. A bit of a sadist, maybe with a touch of masochism thrown in too. Because the other bit of rumour, and not passed on by his friend Jordan, none of it was, said that with one of the victims, the last, as yet not formally identified as Ephraim Humphreys, a teddy-bear had been found. This Teddy, so the tale went, had had one paw removed and a small flail with leather tails sewn on. A nasty little toy, if toy it was, and the rumour was true. You could make what you liked of it. All this, part rumour, part no doubt fact, was at the back of his mind as he spoke to Gabriel. ‘So what do you want?’ Help, she told him, and most of all they wanted, needed, to know exactly what was going on. The other Coffin surfaced briefly. ‘Ah,’ he said. ‘I don't know.’ After all, it was a case and he was a policeman. ‘I'm a bit short of time.’ ‘We need to know what they are looking for. Or even whom.’ She could hear the rumble of conversation in the background. ‘I'm surprised you don't want to find out for yourself.’ ‘All right.’ He pushed a door with his foot, the  noises ceased. ‘I'll see what I can do.’ A man came through the door. ‘I'll try to find time.’ ‘Sir, we've got him.’ He could not keep the triumph out of his voice. He was a young man with dark hair and bright eyes. ‘Parked his car round the corner and walked straight into our arms.’ He was wearing jeans with a dirty sweater and thought no one would know he was a policeman. ‘He knew we were watching his mother, but he did not know his wife had told us where he'd hidden her.’ ‘Good. Thank God for family quarrels.’ With a prayer for the child corrupted. It had to be a child, Coffin thought, and hadn't Mrs Foster been Gilly Slee when he had known her at Hook Road School? Thus began the last chapter of a case that had started as a simple bank robbery, then extended into one of murder and fraud, and drugs. ‘So he's on his way to Greenwich?’ ‘Yes. We packed him off straight away. Brown and Gilmour are with him.’ ‘Fine. You go on too. I'll follow. I've got one or two telephone calls to make. And, one other thing.’ The young detective turned round, bright-eyed, expectant. ‘Don't call me Sir. Anything else, even nothing, but not that.’ After a certain amount of ringing around, he got Phil Jordan. They had never been close friends but they had got on well; lately, however, a gap had opened. He had his own share of responsibility to bear for this. Policemen are not usually intellectuals and have  as a rule a distrust of them as animals of a different breed. John Coffin's historical researches into his ancestors had caught Jordan's attention. Perhaps another factor was the ever-rising star of Commander Dander, old friend and ally of Coffin and now his influential patron. Jordan had no patron, only a father-in-law. ‘What's the news about Mouncy Street, Phil?’ He kept his voice mildly curious. ‘Oh, this and that,’ said Jordan. ‘Things keep turning up.’ ‘So I hear.’ ‘Oh yes. Don't believe all the tales.’ ‘Who does? What about meeting for a drink?’ This case was full of odds and ends that didn't fit together. If he could get Jordan talking, he might get something out of him. Jordan demurred. ‘Pretty busy. You know how it is.’ He paused. ‘Hear you've got great things going on over there.’ ‘All wound up. As of today. What about that drink, Phil?’ ‘Let me see.’ Coffin could hear Jordan speak to someone else in the room. He came back. ‘Yes, why not? I think I can get away.’ Permission received, thought Coffin. He's going to be allowed to talk to me. ‘The Red Anchor, then? In about an hour?’ This would give him time to get back to Mrs Lorimer's, out of his jeans and grubby shirt, and into something that smelt less heavily of the smoke, sweat and beer of the Prince of Wales where he had spent  most of the last few working days. Even a week of sitting there, supping in the beer by a kind of osmosis through the atmosphere, and eating solid sandwiches, seemed to have deposited a tiny roll of fat round his waist. It could not be true that nervous strain made you lose weight. In the Red Anchor, he found a quiet seat in a corner. Phil Jordan arrived just behind him. ‘Nice evening.’ He was prepared to be jovial, setting the scene for their meeting. It made Coffin feel uneasy. ‘You still at Ma Lorimer's? I had a room there once. Heard she'd gone a bit funny.’ ‘No.’ Coffin wouldn't hear anything adverse about his landlady. ‘Sound as a bell.’ ‘Not what I heard. I heard she took a chicken in the basket to the vet and put the cat in the oven.’ ‘Anyone might do that.’ In fact the chicken had been alive but sick, and the cat had got into the oven of his own accord after a bit of baked fish. And got out again pretty smartly. ‘That is, she knew what she was doing.’ ‘I wish I did,’ said Phil Jordan, relapsing into his usual gloom. ‘That's what I want to know.’ ‘I think we're up the creek.’ He had dropped the joviality, even dropped as well the slightly secretive air of one who had been given permission to tell, but not all. ‘We have what you might call circles of evidence. The thing is that they do not seem to touch. The first circle is the bodies. We have IDs for them all.’ Coffin nodded. ‘And they are all about the same  age and they are all boys who have never been in trouble with the police, but the people who taught them and their family were not exactly surprised at what happened.’ ‘Yes. How did you know?’ ‘They had to be like that.’ Anyway, he knew Steve Hilaire, and he could reach the picture through him. Not that Steve was dead. ‘You've got it right,’ admitted Jordan ungrudgingly. Peter Ellis, Mark Lawrence — he was the one dressed up in Mosse's clothes — and Ephraim Humphreys. At least we know their names. What we don't know is what they had in common that made them end up where they did.’ ‘Except their sex and age.’ ‘Yes, except those two things.’ ‘And they were all three killed not long after they disappeared.’ ‘That's just a guess.’ ‘Of course it is. But it's what I'd expect. You can't keep a young boy hidden for long. Not alive anyway.’ ‘Well, you're right. But we have not been able to discover any contact they had in common.’ ‘Although it must be there.’ ‘Unless we think of three different murderers using the same spot.’ ‘Like Timothy Evans and Christie?’ ‘Not acceptable. So we're looking for one person. And one place. One place where the boys went, then were killed.’ He looked at Coffin. ‘We're thinking of your house in Mouncy Street.’ ‘It was Ted Mosse's first.’ ‘And then Rose Hilaire's.’ Coffin felt an immediate need to protect Rose Hilaire. ‘I've heard tales about old Mosse: how he let anyone and everyone in. How it was called The Mad House.’ ‘Yes. I know that; we've heard it, too. There were complaints from the neighbours to the police at that time about the goings-on. We have them on record. There was nothing we could do. After Mosse died, things seemed to have quietened down. But it looks as though the house went on being used as a rendezvous till you bought it. I think Rose Hilaire knew. We'll get it out of her.’ ‘Well, that's a circle and a half. What's your other one and a half?’ ‘We won't pursue the simile, it doesn't work.’ He got up to get them some more beer. ‘We're up the creek because we don't know where to go from here.’ ‘Is that what you've been told to tell me, or is it the truth?’ ‘You can check.’ ‘I might just do that.’ Jordan said uneasily, ‘You know how it is these days, we're getting so scientific. Team-work, and all that. We use what the forensics give us. More and more.’ He sighed. ‘I like it. It's right, but not what I thought when I started.’ ‘You thought you'd be Sherlock Holmes?’ ‘Yes. No. Sort of.’ Coffin smiled. ‘When I started out I met a kid who was going to be a detective. More Sexton Blake he had in mind, I think.’ ‘What happened to him?’ ‘Haven't seen him for years,’ said Coffin regretfully. ‘But I heard he was making a fortune flogging antiques in Los Angeles.’ He looked at Jordan. ‘So what's the problem?’ ‘Witnesses. We haven't managed to flush up one person who saw the boys go into the house, or even very near it. We can't place them there. We can't place anyone there.’ ‘No? ‘Except you occasionally.’ ‘And the people who surveyed the house for the mortgage and the workmen I engaged,’ Coffin reminded him. ‘Except them. And if we could get anything else on any of them we would.’ ‘So they're all non-people?’ ‘As far as we're concerned they don't exist.’ They did exist though, they were men with bodies, energies, lusts. ‘I shouldn't write them right off.’ ‘No. Nor the neighbours, nor the postman and the milkman, nor the shopkeepers in the run of shops round the corner. They have backs into those gardens. In theory they are there. But they are very low down in our lists. Like you.’ ‘Thank you.’ He hoped it was so. ‘Because no witnesses. No direct evidence. All we have is Charley who makes a living doing photography, and a pretty successful living it looks too, who said he's almost sure he saw a boy, can't say whom, standing at the gate of your house one evening about three weeks or so ago. Could have been Ephraim.’ ‘What was Charlie doing?’ ‘Taking photographs.’ ‘Pity he didn't take that one.’ ‘And then we have an old lady, more or less an invalid so she never goes out, who thinks she saw someone climbing over the garden fence one night. She called her son, he's the chemist, but he couldn't see anyone.’ ‘Does seem a load of nothing. But it's always the way. Then something cracks open and you have a case. Or you didn't; he had to admit that was the way too. ‘I can see why you want the forensic boys on it,’ he added thoughtfully. ‘Yes. And what they have told us is that the first body was too far decomposed to be very helpful. He went in about twelve months ago. But it looks as if he was strangled, might have been drugged. Some evidence of having been beaten before death and probably sexually assaulted.’ ‘That was the body dressed up in Mosse's clothes?’ ‘Yes. They were just wrapped around him. Then the second body — in time, that is; the one found first because it was on top — had also been strangled, and possibly sexually assaulted. Traces of drugs. Both of these lads had bits and pieces on their clothes and bodies that placed them as killed in the house where they were buried. Probably in the same room where they were found.’ Coffin waited. ‘It's the third body, the one in your garden, that's got more to say for itself.’ ‘That's the boy, Ephraim?’ ‘He seems to have been moved around. This is what they say: they think he was stabbed in one place — tiny flecks of polished wood on the body. Then he was placed while still alive and bleeding somewhere else. They think that it was an enclosed place, a cupboard, or under floorboards. Either in the building where he was killed or elsewhere!’ The cupboard at Belmodes, thought Coffin at once. ‘How do they know?’ ‘Mouse droppings,’ said Phil Jordan succinctly. ‘And that means he was in a house or somewhere of human usage. The mouse lives with us, you know.’ Belmodes was probably alive with mice. ‘As well as the mouse droppings there was a dead housefly caught up in the clothing. And a slug had left a trail across one leg.’ Now he remembered that Phil Jordan had always transmitted unpleasant details in this lugubrious yet informative way. He was doing it now. Slugs as well as mice at Belmodes, probably. No doubt an acute team of forensic scientists, skilled in the right disciplines, could distinguish between the mice and slugs of Belmodes and those of Mouncy Street and Rose Hilaire's pad. So that was what the search was all about. ‘Then the body was moved again to where it was buried.’ ‘In the garden of my house.’ He thought about it. ‘Seems a lot of moving around?’ ‘There would be a reason for it. The place where the killing took place is being visited. Or something like that.’ ‘Or someone moving in.’ ‘Or someone moving in. Or there are workmen arriving.’ He amplified it. ‘For some reason as yet unknown, the place got dangerous and the body had to be hidden until it could be buried.’ Coffin had been thinking. ‘All this activity does not have to have taken place under one roof?’ He was thinking of the places under review: Belmodes, his house in Mouncy Street, Rose Hilaire's flat. All, or a mixture of all three places, were suspect. Jordan shrugged. ‘If you put it like that, no. This is what we have to establish.’ ‘So that's what the search is about?’ Little bits of this and scraps of that, and Ephraim's bits of wood, flakes of paint, animal excretions from the three establishments named, were going to be gathered and matched against similar scraps found on the three bodies. Then with any luck the investigating team would have some circumstantial evidence to go upon. ‘Just about,’ said Jordan. ‘And you're concentrating on three sites: Belmodes, Rose Hilaire's flat, and my house in Mouncy Street?’ ‘That's about it.’ ‘Any others?’ ‘Not that I know.’ Well, he had got Phil Jordan talking, and this was what he had got. ‘We shall go over the Belmodes factory from wall to wall.’ Coffin wondered if, somehow, the story of Rose Hilaire's nightmare had reached police ears. Not impossible. There is always a point in every case where direct evidence has to give way to circumstantial evidence. What would they call this fantasy of Rose's? He thought it was the end of the conversation, but Jordan had a surprise for him. He offered it to Coffin, not as a prize, but more as an afterthought. He swirled the beer in his glass, staring at it as if it was tea and he was reading the leaves. ‘We found out a funny thing about the kids, lads really, they weren't so young. In all the cases they'd had a violent experience in earlier childhood. Seen violence.’ He ticked them off like items in a catalogue. ‘Body Number One, the first buried, turns out to have been in a railway accident — the one at London Bridge, when he was four. Buried under debris for hours till he was got out. Said to remember nothing about it. That's interesting, if you like.’ ‘He must have remembered a bit.’ ‘Didn't want to. Got it inside him like a stomach-ache. The other boy, the first one found, your body.’ ‘Thanks.’ Even in a joke he didn't want it called his. ‘Well, that boy was rescued from a burning house. One his own father set alight, I may say, by falling asleep when drinking.’ ‘And Ephraim Humphreys?’ ‘Oh yes, him.’ Jordan frowned. ‘He fell off a cliff as a toddler. Fell or was pushed. There was some doubt whether another child had pushed him or not. All in the way of fun, of course. That wasn't the end of it: Ephraim didn't fall far, he got caught in a bush, but he saw the man who was trying to rescue him go all the way down.’ ‘Nasty.’ ‘I wonder if it mattered? We've all been through the war. Lot of violence in everyone's past.’ Jordan, although a great picker-up of interesting details, as now, had no great love for psychological probes. ‘Another thing: not one of the victims has a proper father. One's dead, one's in prison, and the other is a sailor.’ ‘Ephraim?’ ‘His father is a wanderer.’ Jordan ruminated. ‘So each of the victims has a similar profile.’ Sometimes he said good things as if by chance. Coffin envied him his knack. The same profile of violence, seen and endured; the same parental hole to be filled by someone or something. How did the victims' profiles match with that of their killers? Perhaps they fitted together with the protuberances of one party fitting into the hollows of the other to make a perfect whole. Or, put another way, what one had to offer the other needed. His friend had one further shock for him. ‘There's one thing the scientific boys have put forward as a speculation. They're not sure, but they think it looks  as if all three bodies were trussed up like parcels. When newly dead, and before rigor mortis had set in. They detect marks. Almost as if they were going to be posted. Parcel post.’ He had a rotten sense of humour. What he had to say made Coffin feel sick. ‘Wonder who the postman was?’"
FIC FIC-K8V-009 8.92 "Eleven The talk at the Red Anchor had gone on longer than he had expected, and he still had to tell Gabriel and Rose, who must be sitting somewhere waiting anxiously. He found them in a melancholy group, joined by Charley, in Cat's Coffee Shop. ‘How did you know where to find us?’ ‘I used my deductive, detective powers. I rang both homes and got no answer. And then I saw Rose's car.’ ‘Can't miss it, can you?’ Rose was half proud, half disconcerted. ‘Everyone knows my car.’ He sat down beside them. Cat, unasked, produced a cheese sandwich and a cup of frothing coffee. He decided to eat the sandwich and ignore the coffee. He was old enough to remember coffee that did not have a collection of bubbles on top. Over the sandwich, he gave them a suitably edited version of what he had learned. He did not tell them that the bodies had been dealt with like parcels. Nor of the detritus found upon them. ‘That's it, then,’ said Rose. ‘They have a good idea who they are after and now they are looking for evidence to back it up.’ Life in Paradise Street had made her cynical about police work. ‘We might as well go home and watch.’ ‘Will they let us?’ Gabriel took over John Coffin's  neglected cup and began to drink it in anxious little sips. ‘They're all over my place too,’ said Charley. ‘The studio, all the store-rooms. The darkroom, even. I had to give them the keys. Just because I'm your tenant, Rose.’ ‘Sorry.’ ‘Oh, blame Gabriel. She got me in.’ He laughed, as if the idea amused him. ‘If you're worried,’ Coffin reminded him, ‘remember, I'm in there with you. It's my house in Mouncy Street.’ ‘Oh, no one suspects you. Not really.’ Gabriel put down the cup, a little line of froth on her upper lip like a moustache. She looked pretty but pale, for once not concerned for her appearance but for her friends. ‘Policemen have been killers before now.’ Rose said: ‘Gabriel, if I'm arrested, you must take over. You will be in charge of Belmodes. Don't let Dagmar get control; I fear that above anything.’ ‘Yes,’ said Gabriel, both excited and frightened at the prospect. ‘I think I can manage Dagmar.’ ‘As for the shops, let Lesley Jones who runs Beauchamp Place shop be in charge of the whole chain. She's got a head on her shoulders. But keeps her hands out of the till.’ Gabriel nodded solemnly. ‘You can trust me.’ Coffin finished his sandwich. This was a side of both women he had never seen, although Charley could have enlightened him. He felt sad. Rose's kingdom was being divided up. He wanted to say, ‘Don't do it. Remember King Lear. You'll never get it back.’ He chewed the dry crust without speaking. Perhaps it was true. Perhaps Gabriel was to be trusted. But he felt instinctively that in matters of this sort, she was not. ‘Can I finish my coffee, please? If there's any left. This bread is rather dry.’ Masculine intuition, he thought; these two, perhaps you shouldn't trust it, but these two between them could stitch me up. ‘It's a horrible business.’ Rose sounded deeply troubled. ‘These poor boys. I wonder what else they will discover.’ She got up to go. ‘I'll pay for everyone, Cat. My party.’ ‘Won't the police still be in your place?’ ‘Yes. I gave them the keys. But they can't keep me out of my own house, can they?’ She looked at Coffin with inquiry. ‘Probably not.’ ‘I have to collect Steve. I left instructions he was not to go home on his own. Ever. Don't want him going missing. ‘You'll find that difficult to keep up,’ observed Charley. ‘Where is he now, for instance?’ He looked at the clock on the wall. ‘Well after school hours, I'd say.’ ‘Tonight he goes swimming with the PT teacher in charge. I collect him from the swimming pool. Now.’ Coffin rose with her. ‘Can you give me a ride back to Mrs Lorimer's?’ Rose was silent in the car, but she drove in her usual manner only rather faster. In fact, very fast. ‘Worried about Steve?’ Coffin hung on to the side of the car door as it swerved round a cyclist. ‘A bit. But he'll wait for me.’ ‘So what's worrying you?’ ‘After all we've been talking about? Obvious, I should think.’ ‘I saw your face half way through the talk. What did that expression mean?’ Rose drove silently for a few minutes. Up the hill, across the Heath to Lorimer's, newly painted battleship grey, Mrs Lorimer's favourite colour. ‘You know my nightmare — that I am seeing a dead boy (whom I never recognize) on the ground at my feet. Sometimes I seem to be floating above it all, and sometimes I am so much inside I can smell the boy.’ Coffin kept silent. ‘This time as I talked I felt the ground move. It moves, I thought. My feet feel movement.’ She turned to look at him, taking her eyes dangerously off the road. ‘You believe me? Supposing I killed them? Can you do it and not know? A kind of automatic killing in sleep?’ Cautiously he said, ‘In certain circumstances, yes. Not you, though.’ Rose kept her eyes on him. ‘No?’ ‘No. I never believed you didn't know something more real in your mind. In the beginning, yes, it was a kind of dream. But little by little you've remembered. If remembered is the word.’ Her eyes dropped. ‘One day you are going to tell me just a little bit more of this experience of yours.’ Through stiff lips, she said. ‘Am I?’ ‘Yes.’ Rose leaned across to open the door on his side. ‘You get out here.’ Rose drove home, collecting Steve, who was waiting for her, in company with Jim Gordon, the games and swimming specialist from Hook Road. Mr Gordon also taught woodwork and gardening, the educational powers-that-be liking to get value for money. Only religious instruction was denied him. He was also the driver of the school mini-bus which was Hook Road's current pride. Mr Gordon let no one else touch it. Rose and Jim Gordon were old acquaintances and enemies. Steve had had many a brush with Gordon long before the matter of Ephraim's boots in his sports bag. Steve had always been a natural upsetter of any apple-cart his foot came near, whereas Jim Gordon was a sheriff at heart. He was a tall, burly man, in whose company, it always seemed to Rose, Steve looked like a prisoner. They were standing side by side now, and came forward together to the car, and although Jim Gordon had not got his hand on Steve's shoulder, Rose got the distinct impression he might have had. As they drove away, Rose said, ‘Are you on bad terms with that man?’ ‘No.’ Monosyllabic with her as ever, Steve could get feeling into one word. ‘But you don't like each other?’ ‘He's a teacher.’ For Steve, that was communication. Rose drove on home. She knew for certain now, in the way that mothers can, that Steve was protecting  someone, probably a man, possibly a teacher, but someone who had authority over him. Someone he both respected and feared. As it might be you, she told herself ironically. At the door of the flat, Rose said, ‘I've made shepherd's pie for your supper, your favourite.’ ‘You didn't make it. Mrs Hodges made it.’ Steve was talking to her that much. Mrs Hodges was Rose's daily house-cleaner and occasional cook. ‘I did the essential part,’ said Rose. ‘I ordered it.’ Laugh, damn you, she thought; I've made a joke. Not a good one, a very small one, but in the circumstances I deserve a laugh. The savoury smell greeted them as they went through the door. A woman detective whose face she recognized was standing waiting for her. ‘Mrs Hilaire? We're just about finished. I'm Joan Gilmour.’ ‘Oh yes.’ Rose was polite. ‘We met at Hook Road School.’ ‘That's right. ‘Evening, Steve.’ She gave the boy a smile. Steve did not smile back. ‘Why are they here, Mum?’ For the first time he sounded a boy. ‘Thanks for letting us have the keys.’ Joan Gilmour ignored him. Two could play at his game. ‘We've had a survey. I stayed behind to say so. We may be back.’ Rose nodded. ‘Very well.’ ‘I hope we haven't marked your lovely floor. Well, I'll be off. Your supper smells good.’ Rose closed the door behind Joan Gilmour, then followed her son into the kitchen. ‘It would be nice not to have to talk about this, Steve, but we have to.’ As she spoke she was laying him a place at the kitchen table, and serving him his meal. She got a salad, already prepared, out of the refrigerator and laid it on the table. Too much lettuce and not enough cucumber as usual, Mrs Hodges would never learn. Not a bit of pepper, either, unless that green thing lurking under a leaf was one. Mrs Hodges had never mastered the idea of colour in a salad, she seemed to think what you needed was a match. ‘The police were searching this flat for certain sorts of evidence.’ She did not go into details. ‘We have to hope they did not find any.’ Steve started to eat; swimming makes you hungry, and it was his favourite supper. An irrational anger swept over Rose, so that, although she had planned his favourite food and was anxious for him to enjoy it, she now wanted to strike the fork from his lips. She did the next best thing. ‘Steve, do you miss Ephraim?’ He paused, fork in hand. ‘You must miss Ephraim.’ She stared him out. ‘Come on now. You know what I mean, you know what I'm getting at.’ He lowered his eyes. ‘Yes, I miss him. We did play together, but I wasn't with him the time he disappeared. It was the day you took me to the Beatles.’ Rose nodded; so it had been. ‘You went to the house in Mouncy Street together?’ ‘You know that. But not after it was sold.’ He looked down at his plate. ‘I don't know anything.’ ‘Who did you meet there?’ He shook his head. Did he mutter no one? ‘You wouldn't lie to me? No, silence is your thing.’ So it was. Steve had developed silence creatively. ‘There's a question I should have asked before this, Steve.’ Only I was frightened. ‘What sort of games did you and Ephraim get up to?’ No answer. Leaving him to his meal, she went into the sitting-room. The highly polished wooden floor was marked here and there with chalk rings, like an infection. She knelt down to look. Inside each ring was one of those pitted scratches where Steve's boots had marked the oak. Almost certainly one or two scars had had a little extra sliver of wood removed. She sat back on her heels; from the kitchen she could hear the sound of music. Steve had the TV on. ‘Ready, Steady, Go’, she thought. She reached out for the telephone and dialled a well-remembered number. ‘Joe? No, we haven't seen each other lately. I sort of noticed, Joe, how you've been absent since things started popping round here. In fact, I'd say you cleared off pretty smartly. All the time she was keeping an ear on Steve in the kitchen. ‘No, Joe, don't think that; I'm grateful. You did the right thing. Wait a minute, hang on, will you?’ For a moment, she stopped to listen, but a burst of music from the next room reassured her. ‘There is a question I ought to have asked you before, Joe.’ The words came handily. She should have used them before, only she didn't care to. ‘What sort of games did you get up to?’ He couldn't use silence, she knew that very well, you had to be born to it, like Steve, but he had his ways, nothing nasty but cold and dry. You could kill a dream with a voice like that. ‘I'm talking about that night I blacked out. The night I can't remember, the night you say I quarrelled with you and walked away.’ She listened. ‘No, Joe, I was not drunk. I only had that one drink. That's what I'm worrying about. Did you put anything in that drink? I know you, Joe.’ One short sentence answered her. Not to her pleasure. ‘What a pig you are, Joe. But you've answered me. Thank you. I don't know what drug you used, dear Joe, but I'm sure now you used something. And Joe, don't think I'll leave it there.’ She put the telephone down on his voice, before she heard what he said. Still she sat there on the floor, sunk on her heels. How rotten men could be. Some men, all men? She might consider joining Ellie Niven's women's group which met once a week to promote the interests of their sex. She would not give up her bra, however, or dress ugly. Not in her business. Just for a moment she had a vision of a brilliant new line of clothes called Uglies. Stylish ugly, of course, beautiful ugly, and expensive ugly. If it was very, very expensive, then her clients would buy it. Her vision faded: Gabriel could create such a collection, she could not. Suddenly she felt old and out of date. A whole exciting new scene was being born all about her and pushing her out of the way. ‘I'm a hag.’ She got up and went into the kitchen. ‘An unfashionable old hag.’ The sense of humour, of the joke being on her, that was never far from Rose's spirit, made her laugh. Steve had finished eating and looked up. ‘What's the joke?’ ‘I'm not sure if it is one, but if it is I don't think you'd laugh.’ She sat down to study him across the table. ‘Steve, one of the reasons you've been quiet with me lately —’ more than quiet, she thought, stone-cold, dead to me' — one of the reasons has been Joe, hasn't it? You don't like him, and you don't like me knowing him.’ Steve looked down at the tablecloth, tracing a pattern with one finger. ‘No, don't answer. A direct statement might be too much for you. It was one of the reasons.’ ‘Mum, I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.’ ‘I want to believe that. I want to believe you are wholly innocent of those boys’ deaths. I want to believe you never played about with drugs or silly games. In short, I want to believe you are a victim. ‘It was a good shepherd's pie,’ said Steve. ‘Thanks.’ Rose smiled at him. Yes, and thank you can come in many different forms. If her son was a  liar and a deceiver, then he knew how to sound a sincere one. Besides, kids don't kill kids, do they? Not even in Paradise Street had Rose met that phenomenon. As she cleaned away the dishes she wondered what those wooden scrapings from her floor would tell the forensic scientists. The police team had gone from her house, she had managed to avoid seeing them at work by her long session with Gabriel and John Coffin in Cat's Coffee Shop. ‘You in bed, Steve? If not, take yourself off there. Bath first.’ Listening for the bath water running, she went back to the telephone. She had to find the number. ‘Mrs Lorimer? May I speak to John Coffin?’ She could hear Mrs Lorimer shouting for her favourite lodger, then she heard her say in a loud voice, ‘It's a woman. She didn't give her name. Sounds like Rose Hilaire.’ In the war Mrs Lorimer had been an ARP warden; in the peace she was a JP. She was well acquainted with the families of Paradise Street. They all had the same voice, she said. She was no forensic scientist but she was a great scooper-up of information all the same. ‘Rose? Is that really you?’ ‘Yes. Brave of me to confront your dragon.’ ‘No dragon,’ said Coffin, casting a cautious eye towards Mrs Lorimer. ‘You were quite right: I have got more to tell you. Can we talk?’ ‘Now? Shall I come over?’ ‘No, not here.’ She thought of Steve. ‘Let's meet on neutral territory.’ ‘Cat's or the Red Anchor?’ ‘The Red Anchor. I can park the car outside.’ Before she left Rose looked in at Steve. Her son was deeply asleep, one hand underneath his cheek. He was there before Rose with some whisky waiting for her. She drank it without protest. ‘So that's the way of it, how I think it was. I was high on LSD probably, but that's just a guess.’ ‘A bad trip.’ Rose gave a shudder. ‘God help us all. I can't tell you the terrible sense of horror I had. It was like Doomsday. I think I must have been stumbling round. I hope on my feet. But it could have been on my knees. ‘Gabriel saw you.’ ‘She did? God bless Gabriel. Or do I mean that? What did she see?’ ‘You were in Mouncy Street,’ he said gravely. ‘Do you think that was where I saw the body? That I really saw it? When I woke up I was in my own bed with a terrible hangover. Threw my system for days. I thought I was pregnant.’ She drank a good gulp of whisky. ‘And then, although the other horrors faded, I still saw the dead body lying there. I couldn't say where, except it was like a pit, and sometimes I was floating above and it was nothing to do with me. But sometimes, I said No, Rose. You did it. Your hands feel that body. Carry the memory on their fingers.’ She looked at him. ‘I hope I didn't. If I did, can I claim it was the drug?’ ‘Almost certainly. Rose, I'll have to talk to Phil Jordan.’ Or he might speak to Commander Dander. Rupert the Dandy, that sometimes kindly, but always alarming, figure. ‘I know.’ She finished the whisky. ‘Where will he find Joe Landau?’ Vaguely she said, ‘Oh, he'll be around. In the club, for a start. Where do you think he comes in?’ ‘God knows.’ ‘I don't think Joe would kill.’ ‘No?’ He wanted to get Joe for something. ‘No. Playing games, that's one thing, the bastard, but killing I don't see.’ ‘Anyone can.’ ‘Yes.’ She frowned. ‘I just have to hope it wasn't me. ‘It wasn't you three times,’ he reminded her. ‘No.’ She seized that. ‘So I saw something, but didn't do it. And there's one other thing: I had this sensation of movement. Like being on a boat, I think,’ she added doubtfully. ‘I wonder if that means anything.’ ‘I don't know. Drink up.’ They parted amiably, even affectionately. John Coffin saw her into the car and watched her drive away, then himself walked home across the Heath. Several people had noticed them in the bar, but no one saw when they left. At some time between that parting and morning Rose Hilaire disappeared. Her car was parked outside  where she lived, but she herself was nowhere to be found. Her son, Steve, got up, gave himself breakfast, and took himself to school without reporting her absence. As he said later, she was often away from home."
FIC FIC-K8V-010 9.44 "Twelve The alarm came first from Belmodes. Gabriel came in early, anxious to find out what the police team had done the night before. She was relieved to find she could get in. She could hear activity in the workrooms. Dead quiet, though. The machines were whirring away, but no voices. She peeped in. One of the women, at the machine nearest the door, looked up and smiled. Then she shrugged and went back to work. That was the feeling of the day, then? Put your head down and pretend nothing is happening. Gabriel wished she could have done so herself. But her breakfast had been broken into by a phone call from Charley, cancelling a work session with her later that day. The police had left a mess in his place: he'd be busy. No, he didn't know what, if anything, they had taken away, nothing, he rather thought, but they had left it untidy. He sounded sour. Or perhaps just tired. She shrugged off the cancellation. Her heart was no longer in the campaign against Rose. They were two women together now in a hostile world. Where was Rose? She wandered round the factory looking for her and came across Dagmar doing the same. ‘Where is she? Do you know?’ Dagmar had her  hostility to Gabriel well buttoned up, but it was still there. Judging by her tone, she might even have transferred some of it to the absent Rose. ‘I must have her, I've got that man from Milan who wants to do business with Belmodes coming in this morning. She ought to be here.’ Dagmar had her finger in all Rose's pies, checking their temperature. ‘I can manage him.’ Gabriel had met the man, a long-faced northern Italian. Dagmar ignored the offer. ‘I've rung her at home and there's no answer.’ ‘Then she's not there.’ ‘She could be asleep. No, I kept ringing. Rose doesn't sleep that heavy. You don't think the police have got her? She hasn't been arrested?’ ‘How would I know?’ ‘You know a policeman.’ ‘Not his case,’ said Gabriel automatically, as if John Coffin was speaking through her. ‘What about the boy? He must know where his mother is.’ ‘Might know,’ corrected Dagmar. ‘I never knew where my mother was all day. Did you? No, let's leave him out of it.’ By midday they were still agreed to leave Steve out of it, but Gabriel was telephoning Coffin. Once again she tried the ask, ask and ask again technique, and once again it worked. He sounded surprised. ‘How did you know I was here?’ He was standing in the bare, empty front room of his own house in Mouncy Street. There was no sign of any of his colleagues, but the door to the kitchen  area was sealed and padlocked. Looking about him, he could see that tiny segments of woodwork from the floor he was waxing and polishing and from the doors he was stripping of paint, had been removed with delicate precision. As he came through the front door he had picked up his post. He identified his electricity bill and the telephone bill (he hoped his colleagues had not been using his phone too much) and a typewritten envelope which he took to be an advertisement. He tucked them in his pocket, where he forgot them. ‘I kept on asking. No good. So I thought: Let's try Mouncy Street. He could be there. It's his house.’ Not his case, but his house. It was a kind of refrain that seemed to mark his life at the moment. ‘You're getting to know me too well.’ ‘Not nearly well enough.’ Gabriel could always find time for a little flirtation. ‘But that's not it, just now. We can't find Rose. She's not here at Belmodes. Not at any of the shops. Nor at home. Dagmar and I are worried. Now Coffin too felt alarmed. There was a feel about this moment that he did not like. A real, genuine premonition of bad news. ‘No, I don't think she'll have been arrested.’ Not just yet. Or not in that way. It would be no secret. This wasn't a police state and 1984 was a long way off. ‘Have you asked the son?’ ‘No. Not yet. We don't like to worry the school.’ ‘What about popping round? Must be coming up for school dinner-time.’ She knew he was fobbing her off, but she accepted it; she was willing to sit in the  back seat and let him do the driving. She was tired and a little afraid. ‘All right. I'll let you know what I find out.’ After a little consideration he decided to talk to Phil Jordan. After several attempts he got him at last on a bad telephone line. Not only the usual crackles but voices muttering away in the background. It wasn't, he thought, that he and Jordan got lines so much worse than anyone else, it was just that more people were listening to them. Give something, get something. He would trade with Jordan. But first he would get the information he wanted. Standing in his own house, once his pride, now an abomination. It was still hot outside, and his house had at once the smell of summer and the smell of death. He was surprised he hadn't recognized that smell the minute he moved in. He made a start. ‘Phil? You won't know anything yet from the forensics?’ ‘No.’ Jordan was giving no ground. Hardly could, really. Neither of them expected it, especially with everyone listening in. ‘Takes time. But as the owner of one of the sites you've been turning over, could you be more specific about what they're looking for? I can see bits of my woodwork have gone.’ As though the mice had been at it. ‘I wish I could frame the question so you could just answer Yes or No, Phil, but I can't do that.’ ‘No. Yes.’ ‘I think you'd help me if you could, Phil.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Thanks. So if I made some guesses you might be able to answer.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘The wood is a bit special. Something a bit different. Something they think they could match easily?’ ‘No.’ ‘No? No, then it's not the wood itself, but something on it. Paint?’ He answered that one himself, looking at his own floor. ‘Stain?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘But it might be No? A kind of stain?’ ‘Yes, that's it,’ said Jordan. ‘Not as good as a fingerprint,’ said Coffin, ‘but I can see it would help. Well, thanks. Let's meet for a drink sometime.’ ‘Yes,’ said Jordan, sounding as if he meant No. ‘Ah, I get you. Nice expressive voice you've got there Phil. Ever thought of going on the stage?’ Then Coffin stopped himself. He must not alienate Phil Jordan, who was only doing his job and trying to be a friend at the same time. There was something about the wood fragments that Jordan knew and was not saying. Was Jordan trying to tell him something, and if so, what? Something about the nature of wood, perhaps. ‘Listen, Phil. I know you can listen even if you can't talk. Do you know the whereabouts of Rose Hilaire? She hasn't been in to Belmodes, and is not answering her phone. Do you have news of her to tell me?’ He guessed the answer to that would be No, and  it was. What he did not expect was the long pause, and then the urgency of Phil Jordan's voice. ‘That offer of yours — I'll take it up. The Red Anchor this evening. Hang about.’ This time it was his turn to give the one word answer. ‘Yes.’ As he put the receiver down he thought: Rose, I've got to find you fast. And first, before my friends and colleagues do. Then it boiled down to one simple reaction: dear Rose, I've got to find you. By the time Gabriel and he met in the late afternoon they knew that Rose had probably never got home the night before. ‘So I was the last one to see her?’ said Coffin. ‘Unless Steve…?’ He looked at the boy. They were standing in Rose Hilaire's own kitchen. Gabriel had collected Steve from school and brought him home, where she had cooked him a meal. She shook her head. ‘He says not. Didn't hear her, and she wasn't there in the morning, no sign of her bed being slept in. So he went to school.’ At the moment Steve was eating baked beans on toast with easy pleasure. A cool customer. ‘He says he's done it before.’ Coffin's eyes met Gabriel's, hers full of meaning so that he looked away sharply. Silly to be jealous, everyone knew Rose was no chaste angel. ‘Think she's with a man?’ Gabriel reflected. ‘No. I wish I did think so, but I don't.’ Charley came in, carrying a small grey cat and a carrier bag of shopping. ‘I got all the stuff you wanted, Gaby. And I found this animal outside.’ Steve spoke for the first time. ‘That's our cat.’ ‘Has he got a cat-flap?’ ‘No.’ ‘When you went to school, did you let him out?’ ‘No, he was asleep on Mum's bed.’ ‘So someone came in.’ ‘Rose?’ asked Gabriel. ‘Someone with a key. You're sure the cat was in, Steve?’ ‘Certain sure.’ Steve was opening a tin of food for the cat, who was meowing silently. Coffin watched him. He did not believe that Rose, if she had come back into the flat, would have let the cat out, or left it unfed. People under pressure could act out of character, certainly, but they also acted according to habit. ‘Someone's got Rose's key,’ he said aloud. ‘Maybe Rose herself. Maybe not. I know what I think.’ Charley put the kettle on. ‘Let's have some coffee, and I brought some brandy. Hop off to your room, Steve, and don't think too much.’ Steve went, without a backward look, but carrying the cat. ‘Charley, you're a wonder,’ said Gabriel. ‘How can you be so relaxed?’ Charley shrugged. ‘Remember me? Born in a bomb-shelter. I believe they had to dig Mum and me out. Starting that way, you go on as you came.’ He  poured the coffee, adding a good measure of brandy to each mug. He put plenty in his own. ‘What are we worrying about? A few scraps of wood, a pair of pants stained with blood that's the same group as Ephraim's. That's right?’ He cocked an eyebrow at Coffin, who nodded. ‘And a woman gone away who is well able to look after herself.’ An interesting man, thought Coffin, I never took him in before. ‘And three dead bodies,’ Gaby reminded him sharply. ‘Don't be too jolly. Those boys are dead, poor little beggars.’ ‘I'm not likely to forget, Gaby. Drink up your coffee,’ said Charley calmly. ‘I know where I rate death in life's tragedies. After being crippled but below senility.’ ‘But dying —’ began Gaby. ‘For all we know dying may be a delicious experience, like dropping into a warm bath after being cold all day. Life's last treat for us.’ Yes, an interesting fellow. He could certainly manage Steve and possibly Gabriel as well. He felt relieved. Better she should be with a youngster nearer her own age than with him, who anyway fancied Rose Hilaire. He left them cooking each other supper and drinking brandy. A good couple. Perhaps Gaby was the man of the two. Certainly Charley's hair was as long as hers, blonder and curlier too. But Coffin no longer disliked this; he might let his own hair lengthen. His hairdresser  had said tactfully that short back and sides was no longer an unquestioned good thing. As he hung about the Red Anchor he noticed for the first time that its character was changing. The lovely smell of beer and tobacco smoke built up over almost a hundred years was being driven out by other smells: fresh paint, newly-glued-together plastic and fried food. The cigarettes people smoked smelt different as well and his policeman's nose told him they were not all honest virginia. The furniture was on the move too, with the old, solid benches and wooden chairs being replaced with curving, light-weight new ones in bright colours. In fact, without his realizing it a rising tide of change was lapping around his ankles. Phil Jordan was with him before he realized, breaking into his thoughts. ‘Let's make this quick.’ ‘I feel the same way.’ Worry about Rose was paramount now. ‘What we said on the phone was true enough; of course, the forensics don't have any news for us yet. It sometimes takes weeks, we both know that.’ Coffin nodded. He was still thinking about Rose. What state would she be in if weeks passed before she was found? This is a private conversation.’ Jordan looked at Coffin, who nodded. ‘So I can tell you that the word is that they have not found what they were looking for. At a first glance none of the samples match what they had from the body specimens.’ ‘So it's a No? You are still looking for where the boy could have been?’ ‘You could say so. The team's feeling is that when we find that place we will know who was the killer. It'll really pin it down.’ ‘Anything else?’ He had felt on the telephone Jordan had a little nugget of information tucked away somewhere. ‘About what they were hoping to find, maybe?’ ‘The wood scraps found on the boy's clothes suggested someone, somewhere, was doing some house decoration. Anyway, repairs. Perhaps clumsily. You know — household fragments. The wood was stained and waxed.’ There was definitely a something in Jordan's voice, but Coffin couldn't make out what it meant. Household fragments? He was thinking it out when Jordan stood up. ‘Here, wait a minute,’ Coffin said hastily. ‘What about Rose Hilaire?’ ‘That lady hasn't been reported missing, and she is definitely fully adult. If you can find her, good luck to you, but there's nothing I can do.’ ‘Unofficially. ‘Unofficially, I'll see what I can find out. And equally unofficially, it's a pity you've got to know her.’ ‘Why are you in such a hurry?’ ‘I do have a home to go to.’ ‘Yes,’ said Coffin sadly. And he hadn't. Or rather the house in Mouncy Street had been taken over by a succession of dead bodies. He really minded about the house. He had arrived by bus, now he decided to cut across the Heath, through Greenwich Park and to Rose's flat. He could relieve Gaby and Charley of baby-watching Steve, and perhaps do some clue-hunting in the flat. Did Rose have a passport? And if so, where was it? He minded about Rose, too. He was beginning to get the idea that he wasn't meant to have a happy future with women. If he ever married, then it would be an unhappy marriage. He could see it ahead of him, like a rock you could not miss. Perhaps he should stay with his family history and forget anything else. It was a longish walk on a warm evening so he took it slowly, letting his mind roam over the case as he walked. He strolled deep in thought. On a seat beneath General Wolfe's statue, which looks down on the river and is still scarred by the bombs of a war later than the one in which he died, Coffin rested for a while. I've lost my way, he thought. Not with my feet, they know the way to go, but with my mind. There's something I ought to have sorted out, I can sense it, but I need to think. Forensic evidence was all well and good. Some cases, the easy ones, were solved by it like an intellectual puzzle. Into other cases emotion and imagination came into play. There was the profile of the murderer and the profile of the victim and the one should tell you about the other. They had to match. He thought about what he knew of the victims. Boys, young lads, not happy boys or they would  not have sat so loosely to life that they could come the way of their murderer. Not quite vagrants, but little lost boys. Boys away from base, curious boys willing to make strange friends in Mouncy Street. Boys willing to try drugs. Drugs did come into this story, that had to be recognized, and no doubt the police investigating team knew more about that than he did. But he knew enough, because he knew about Rose and Joe Landau. Drugs were floating around this case. It was something about the times that drugs should be so easily come by. LSD was the new one. All you seemed to need was the right ingredients and a competent chemist. Make it in your own backyard. So in the profile of the murderer came drugs, and Mouncy Street and boys. Sex and death. Death and sex. Which way round had they come, and which had been most important to the killer? He got up to walk down the hill in the golden light. He could see the River Thames below with the new high-rise housing blocks already beginning to show up on the skyline. He wasn't sure he liked what he saw, but they did represent homes, good little ones, he hoped, and if you did not accept change then the human race would still be running in caves. As he walked he reflected that he had one other item to add to the profile of each boy. In the family background there was a death. They were boys who knew that death could come close. So should you look for this too in the youth of their killer? Come to think of it, you did not have to look far. Just over twenty years ago the war had ended. Every adult then alive knew what violent death meant. This was even more true of the children. A child then might have seen or heard talk of acceptable violence because that was what war was. Taken in with his bottle of National Dried Milk and vitamin drops that it was all right to kill. So you had to look for someone who had grown up with the idea that you could kill. Someone like that might even find it a pleasure. Absorbed in his thoughts, he stumbled on. He was beginning to form a picture of the murderer and even beginning to wonder if he had a match. No face, of course, no actual person, just a type. A young, but possibly not a very young person, probably male. Able to dissemble, because those lads had not expected to be killed. Or so one had to assume. A bit of an actor then, able to hide his or her true face from friends and relations. Probably not very close to anyone. But a householder. He thought about that: perhaps not actually a householder, just someone with access to the two houses in Mouncy Street, his own house and the one next door. And someone who had come into the district recently. This was his own view, because the timespan of all the deaths was so close. Or, if an old inhabitant, and you had to consider this, although he hated to think of Mouncy Street and Decimus Street and Paradise Street in this connection, then some twist, some accident, some encounter had set the killer off. At the bottom of the hill there was a telephone-box. He knew Phil Jordan's home number and dialled it, hoping Jordan had been telling the truth about going home. The two of them had once shared a mistress in Lewisham, but only for a little while. Still, he knew that number too. Jordan was there, and eating supper. It was still in his mouth. ‘Oh, you,’ he said. ‘What is it?’ ‘When you said ‘household fragments’, what did you mean? You meant me to guess, but I can't. Was it dust?’ ‘There might have been. I dare say there was. Dust is only particles of other stuff, after all. But you're reading too much into it. I don't know that I meant you to guess anything,’ he said grudgingly. Coffin waited: he knew his man. ‘As it happens, there was something else. I believe there are glass fragments. Forensics can identify the refractive index of a sliver.’ It was something to think about as he walked on, hurrying now. Glass? There was plenty of glass around in houses, and a selection of broken glass in his own house and others in Mouncy Street. Not only houses had glass, of course. So did motorcars. Briefly, he recalled Rose Hilaire's voice saying of her nightmare vision, ‘But it moved.’ Rose, he thought with sudden agony, where the hell are you? He could see the roof of Belmodes as he turned towards where Rose lived. Her car was still parked in the same place, already it looked dusty and unused. Around the corner of the building he saw a figure on a bike speeding away. He looked up to the windows of Rose's flat. Gabriel had the window wide open and was standing there looking down at him. He called up. ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Waiting.’ ‘Where's Charley?’ ‘Oh, he'd some work to do.’ She let him into the flat, where the television was on. ‘Where's the boy?’ ‘In his room still. He might be asleep.’ ‘Have you looked?’ ‘Well, no.’ He went along the hall to Steve's room and pushed open the door. The bed was empty. He went back to Gabriel. ‘He's hopped it. I think I saw him on a bicycle.’ ‘But why? Where?’ Coffin thought. ‘He's gone to the factory, I'd say. Or that way: Mouncy Street. We'd better go after him.’ ‘That's just guessing.’ ‘Got a better idea?’ Gabriel was silent. Then she said, ‘Let's take Rose's car. The keys are in it. I had a look.’ He should have looked himself; he might have got some indication. ‘Rose would never leave the keys in, would she?’ ‘You bet,’ said Gabriel with conviction. ‘Can you drive this thing?’ He looked at the foreign  controls. No broken windows or splintered windscreen? ‘Drive anything,’ said Gabriel, which was a complete lie, but she had always longed to get her hands on Rose's car. ‘Rose ever have an accident in it?’ ‘Not that I know of. No, I'm sure not. Why?’ The car was already on the move. He answered with another question. ‘How was Steve? Did he seem frightened?’ Coffin was already beginning to wonder if he could fit a face to the type of killer he had imagined. ‘Didn't say a thing after you left. He never does. He could have been scared rigid for all I know.’ ‘I think he was.’ ‘Is he running away, then?’ ‘I think he's looking for his mother.’ Gabriel gave him a puzzled look, then concentrated on her driving. ‘I think a boy would,’ he said, half to himself. ‘She is his mother.’ ‘You would, and I would,’ said Gabriel. ‘But Steve?’ ‘She's all he's got.’ The traffic lights at the corner of King William's Walk held them up. ‘How did the Cuban Missile Crisis make you feel, Gaby?’ he asked suddenly. ‘Awful. I wanted to run.’ ‘And did you feel you wanted to take what pleasure you could while you could?’ ‘Oh yes. I felt I had a right. I had a fantasy. I'd go  into Fortnum's and try on a sable coat just so I wouldn't die before I'd worn one. Why?’ ‘I think times like that affect people profoundly.’ ‘So what happened to you, then?’ The lights changed, Gabriel pulled away. ‘I found out, by chance, that the girl I was in love with and hoping to marry was having it off with a colleague. So I went to bed with her too. Insisted on it. Not nice, was it?’ Gabriel said nothing; she had not been looking for a life-story. Right, then right again, then left into Mouncy Street. No sign of Steve, no sign of anyone, the street was deserted in the dusk. Gabriel drove slowly towards Belmodes. She stopped the car, preparing to park it in Rose's special slot. They both got out, looking around. Coffin saw the boy first. ‘There's Charley's van,’ said Gaby in surprise. Slowly, round the corner of the passageway that ran behind Belmodes, came a blue and white van. The van's progress was unsteady. ‘What is Charley doing?’ Half way down the passageway, the van stopped moving. At the wheel was a short figure, arms at full stretch. ‘It's not Charley,’ said Coffin. ‘Can't you see? It's the boy.’ He saw Steve's small pretty-boy's face set like a hard little mask. No expression and drained of colour, the eyes stared past him. He was no longer certain he knew what Steve was about. The van began to move forward again. ‘Stop him!’ cried Gabriel. ‘Watch out. He knows what he's doing.’ ‘How?’ ‘Charley, Charley!’ shouted Gabriel. She began to run away from the van, round the side of the building in the direction of Charley's place. He might hear or he might not, reflected Coffin. Gabriel had lost her head. But he had heard. Charley came running round the corner. Gabriel threw herself towards him. ‘He's in the van, he's in the van,’ she screamed. ‘And he knows how to drive. Stop him!’ Charley did not answer. He looked surprised at the scene that confronted him, with Gabriel screaming, Coffin silent in the road staring at the van with the small tense figure at the window. He would have been even more surprised if he could have read Coffin's thoughts: If the lad wanted to drive away, why didn't he take Rose's car? And the answer: Because the van was what he wanted. Gabriel grabbed his arm. ‘Do something!’ ‘Do what I can.’ He began to run towards the van. He's only a kid, he thought, remember that, he's only a kid. Behind him Charley was in the middle of the road, also beginning to move towards the van. Suddenly the van accelerated and shot forward at speed. It missed Coffin, who jumped back, then drove straight at Charley. There was a thud as it hit his body, which rose in the air, fell across the bonnet of the van, then was  tossed forward on to the paving stones. The van drove on, pressing the body beneath. Gabriel was screaming. ‘He'll kill us all, he'll kill us all,’ she was repeating. Coffin put his arm round the trembling girl, he felt none too steady himself. This was what it felt like to win a victory and lose the war. He knew the murderer now and he felt like hell. ‘Oh no,’ he said. ‘He won't. He's done the job he came for.’ Marvellously, the van had stopped. Steve was sitting at the wheel. He let Coffin go up and drag him out. His gaze met Gabriel's. The girl was kneeling by Charley's body. ‘It was an accident,’ he said without expression. ‘I can't drive; the van got away from me. I shouldn't have been let touch it.’ ‘What are we going to do with you?’ said Coffin. What would anyone ever do with Steve? For answer, Steve jerked his head towards the van. ‘Mum's inside. I guess she's dead.’ Gabriel looked into his pale eyes, so hard to read. What a scheming, clever, manipulative little beast. Whoever loves that one, she thought, will know what pain is. But then, in matters of that sort it was always the same, and thinking of Charley, she began to cry."
NWS NWS-A1F-002 5.79 "Work-out with the trolley freaks By MILES KINGTON DO YOU sometimes feel you should take more exercise? But just don't seem to have the time or even the energy? Then the answer is to combine a fitness routine with something you're doing already — and that's why we've come up with our great series of supermarket trolley exercises! Yes, you can actually get all the body work-out you need while you're just wheeling your shopping round your local supermarket. That lump of metal on wheels can actually be the most useful exercise machine you ever meet — but ONLY if you know how to get the maximum use out of it. And that's why we asked Professor James Leotard, who researches Body Culture at Milton Keynes University, to devise a series of six simple trolley toning exercises. Here they are. 1. When turning a corner into the next aisle of the shop, don't tamely walk round behind the trolley and push it in the new direction. Make the trolley turn ONLY by using the strength of your arms. Tones up arms, shoulders and stomach. 2. Try to push and lift at the same time — go on, try to get the back wheels off the ground as you go along! Not easy, is it, especially when you've got the mineral water and bags of flour aboard? But it's a lovely feeling when you finally find you can do it. Excellent for arms, shoulders, legs, heart and best end. 3. Normally you wouldn't be seen dead doing a knees bend keeping your back straight, but if you're getting something off the bottom shelf you won't look ridiculous at all. Here's how it goes. You say: ‘Ah, tinned water chestnuts. Just what I need.’ You go down, slowly, slowly, don't rush it, pause five seconds, take the tin, then up. Then you say: ‘Ugh! Preservatives!’ and do the same movements to replace the tin. This can be repeated at every new shelf. Wonderful for thighs, stomach, calves, hams and smoked bacon. 4. Lift yourself off the ground as you go along. Go on, push yourself up on the handles and let the trolley take you for a ride, just like a child! Fine for shoulders, arms, kidneys, liver and offal. You meet lots of new people too. 5. Here's one you can do when you're waiting in that boring old queue. Stand up straight. Hold trolley at arm's length. Now, without moving your feet from where they are, let the trolley slowly roll away from you until you feel it start to go out of control — then pull it back. This exercises all the muscles in the body, and in your neighbours' as well! 6. Finally, just try to wrench your trolley to pieces. Go on, try to twist and buckle it with your bare hands. Pull it apart. Tear bits off it. Turn it into the sort of jangled pile of metal the Tate Gallery would be glad to make an offer for. You won't be able to make any impression with your bare hands, of course, unless you're a trained weight lifter, but you'll feel your body really working! (A word of caution: watch out for that yoghurt on top.) After a few weeks of this, I can guarantee you'll be feeling quite a different person, and unable to wait to get out for your Sainsbury's session, or your Waitrose-lifting! When you hear the word shopping in future, your pulse will race and your red corpuscles will be off and away before you can say ‘This Week's Special Offer’. Truly, your shopping list will become your freeway to fitness! From Dr Armand Pastor GP Sir, I have started to get an extraordinary amount of patients with minor and sometimes major physical injuries caused by supermarket trolleys -pulled muscles, dislocated cartilages, broken fingers and limbs, ruptured yoghurt, etc. My inquiries reveal that most of these are caused by exercise programmes devised by ignorant charlatans feeding off our need for health. These fads for physical fitness invariably, in my experience, lead to two things: a great deal of unnecessary injury and a lot of profit to the people behind the scheme. Mark my words, at this very moment someone is trying to cash in on this supermarket trolley fetish with some useless bit of equipment or other. You just wait and see. Yours fearfully AN ANNOUNCEMENT You know, your weekly visit to the supermarket is a good start. But it isn't really enough to have a work-out on the trolley once every seven days, is it? So we have devised a genuine exercise supermarket-type trolley for you to use in your own home. Styled in hard-wearing canadium, it has a built-in meter so that you can know at a glance if you're applying enough pressure. At last, you can go trolley training every day! Give yourself a treat and go shopping for a new body with the INDEPENDENT TROLLEY TRAINER! Only £179.99. (Warning: Not suitable for shopping.)"
NWS NWS-A7S-003 7.33 "Jackboots beneath the serge Television. By Hugh Hebert THERE was one point when the hair on the back of my head began to lift. Not at Paul Hill's remembrance of beatings past, when he could hear the sound of steel-tipped boots running to take part in the fun, and once heard a principal medical officer, no less, telling colleagues: ‘Don't walk his face, don't walk his face.’ Not even the time he was dunked head first in a tub of dubious liquid, and brought up gasping for breath: ‘Make him sing God Save the Queen!’ they shouted. Brutality, as Hill describes and felt it, was a bitter part of his prison life; you just learnt to get down on the floor as fast as you could and cover up as best you could. But it was Gerry Conlon's account of being interrogated after the Guildford bombings that made the scalp crawl. We know your mother works at the Royal Victoria Hospital, they told him, we know where your sister works, and there are sectarian killings down there. ‘They told me they could arrange an ‘accident’. And I believed they were capable of murdering my mother, I honestly believe they would have murdered my mother — that's why I signed the statement.’ The account he gave just after his release was that the threat had been that a British soldier might ‘accidentally’ shoot one of the women. A few months ago even, this would have seemed improbable. You might have assumed this was the police bluffing and bullying. Yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders, you can't shrug off the shiver Conlon's words bring. There were daunting moments in last night's First Tuesday (Yorkshire), but few of them matched that hint of a jackboot under the blue serge. It's right that the Guildford Four have told their stories now to Grant McKee and Ros Franey and First Tuesday, the programme and the producers who dug away, and did much to keep the case alive. And they told it without on-screen questioning, though the programme is skilfully structured to give it a coherence it might have lacked. Carole Richardson's is the most haunting face. You have to hope that its blankness will slowly dissolve and let life in. Just once a couple of tears rolled down. It was when she described seeing film of the results of the bombing on television, and thinking: ‘They think I did that!’ Armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface. He pays tribute to his treatment at Gartree prison, he apologises to the bomb victims' families that they have had to keep reminding them of their loss: ‘But we had to fight for our freedom.’ Hill expresses the way time has cheated them: his daughter was born while he was remanded in custody, and is now 14: ‘She would change dramatically and I didn't feel a change in myself mentally. I'm still 20 in my head. Nothing's happened to me. I haven't lived.’ But again it was Conlon, the slightly wild-eyed Irish poet of the quartet, articulate, flamboyant — remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the Old Bailey — who cut deep into the collective conscience. He described being taken over the years to see his sick, and finally dying and almost certainly innocent father in another prison. He was convicted with the Maguires in the parallel case of a ‘bomb factory’. And he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence. Only the nurses could do that. And at the end, Conlon drew the one hopeful conclusion: ‘If this stops capital punishment ever coming back, the time I've spent in prison will be well worth it. If this stops another innocent person going to prison, it'll be well worth it… ‘I've had numerous prison governors say to me, Yes, Conlon, we know you're innocent, but there's nothing we can do about it. We get a custody order, and that's it. What sort of system of justice is that?’ IT wasn't the only programme last night to shine light into dirty corners. Inside The Brotherhood (Granada), produced by Claudia Milne and Martin Short, dug into the most notorious area of Masonic influence, local government. In Southend, where 3,000 of the 50,000 adult males are reckoned to be Masons, it went into the case of what you might call Preferential Allocation of Council Property, and the battle of one councillor, Christopher Hudson, to break the grip of the men on the Square: ‘We can't have a secret society operating within the framework of a democracy,’ he said. ‘It's a paradox, it's a nonsense.’ Though over the years, from Southend to Tyneside and the Government's own Property Services Agency, there's all too much evidence that this is exactly what we do have."
NWS NWS-A7Y-004 7.08 "Input/Tim Radford We come to hit hypocrites with a brick, not to praise them. PERHAPS there should be more hypocrisy in the world. There's plenty in Britain. The British go to night classes in it, and particularly savour high-class hypocrites. They tend to admire people for how they hold themselves and what they say and then blame them more for being found out than for what they do. After a while you get tainted with hypocrisy even if you try not to. You begin to see that it's just another language. You begin to enjoy the way people can say ‘The National Health Service is safe in our hands’ or ‘Nobody deplores apartheid more than we do’or even ‘We do not have a shoot-to-kill policy’and you know that another hospital is going to close and that there will be another stitch-up with Pretoria and that another shooting is going to be quietly forgotten. It is, admittedly, refreshing to meet the occasional non-slippery politician. ‘Frankly, Tim, we cocked that one up,’ an Antipodean politico said to me once. ‘We made a real dog's breakfast of it.’ It was quite a clever move on his part. Suddenly I didn't have anything else to ask him. Actually, politicians are never that frank, and never honest: the game isn't played that way. And anyway, if somebody is too forthright and says what he really thinks you might feel impelled to hit him with a brick. But then hypocrisy has grades, like judo. In Britain they are all black belts. The British murmur ‘You must come and stay with us some time,’ and when they part they say ‘Let's keep in touch’and they certainly don't mean it, but it greases the wheels of intercourse. And it stops you having to hit them with a brick. There have been grade-A hypocrites all through history. The Roman Emperors were much more slippery than anyone gives them credit for. One of them once issued an edict against promiscuous kissing on New Year's Day. He complained about the absurd cost of mullet and in a wild bid to introduce good housekeeping to Imperial Rome he served for dinner what was leftover from the banquet before. He showed ‘excessive’ courtesy to the House of the Senate, saying once ‘You will, I hope, forgive me if I trespass on my rights as a senator by speaking rather more plainly than I should.’ It was the Emperor Tiberius, one of history's unspeakable bounders. Since this is a family newspaper, one shrinks from recounting the things he bounded round doing on Capri. But they had nothing to do with cheap mullet. Tiberius was one of those men you are warned to flee from and report to the police when they arrive offering sweets. He was one of those men of whom the historian Edward Gibbon, who wrote the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, reported their disgusting activities ‘in the decent obscurity of a learned language.’ That meant he could say it in Latin, which, when you think about it, was another fundamental hypocrisy. But fundamentalists are not usually hypocrites. They are a different problem. They believe in the truth and they aren't frightened of telling you about it. Their truth of course, but they recognise no other. Furthermore they don't know about ‘good form’ and ‘bad form’and saying one thing and doing another. But fundamentalists are also really dangerous, at least for a while, because hypocrites think that everybody is talking double talk, like them, and awful misunderstandings occur. They don't have to be religious fundamentalists. They can just be people who believe they ought to reshape society from top to bottom. But they are just as difficult to read if you are used to political hypocrisy. But then the British — or perhaps more properly the English — deal best with their own. To them, hypocrisy is aggravated assault by other means. They can execrate someone whom they decide is a useless clown and they do this by making him a Lord, giving him the chairmanship of a quango and telling the chaps at the Athenaeum to hand him non-executive directorships in 15 companies and a merchant bank. It's the same as knee-capping, and everybody knows it, but much kinder. Fundamentalists execrate someone for writing a book that they haven't read, and a famous novelist has to go into hiding for fear of his life. Well, at least he knew, right there and then, that he had to go into hiding. There is one thing in favour of total non-hypocrisy: at least you know where you stand, for as long as you are allowed to stand, and, of course, as long as you can be sure they aren't being a tiny bit hypocritical too."
NWS NWS-AHC-081 6.88 "Family Life: Mum's home thoughts for abroad By Laurie Graham THE SENIOR Daughter is about to leave home. We've been together now for 18 years and it don't seem a day too long, but I can see there does come a time when it's good for mother and child to view one another from a distance. That time is now upon us. I was 19 when I left home and went to university. I tumbled out of the nest, where I'd been a cosseted only child, and into digs. They turned out to be very nice digs, but I was still faced, for the first time in my life, with the practicalities of keeping myself fed and clothed, and getting to lectures and passing exams. Frankly, I didn't have a clue. I didn't make any enquiries about how the laundry got done until the day I ran out of clean tights. My catering was limited to brewing endless mugs of insipid coffee and opening packets of custard creams. But I got by. In fact, within two years I had gone to the other extreme, washing shorts for lads who were old enough to do it for themselves, and baking cakes for the sole purpose of giving them away. It was as though playing in the Wendy House was something I had to do before I could settle to weightier matters. I vowed that my children would be better prepared when they left home. From an early age I expected them to do things for themselves, and sometimes for me, and when they snivelled about their friends having kind and conscientious mothers who changed their sheets and made fruit pies, I said ‘Some day, when you're at Sunderland Polytechnic and living by your wits, you'll thank me.’ Well, the Senior Daughter isn't going to Sunderland to study. She's going to Italy to be a Mother's Help. No sooner had the news leaked out than my telephone started ringing. I was in a fever of vicarious excitement, looking at street plans of Florence and trying to remember the name of a boy I'd met in the Boboli Gardens in 1961, but friends and relations were wanting to know whether I had really vetted the family, whether I'd like to hear a selection of au pair horror stories, and whether I'd made good any gaps in my daughter's domestic skills. I've relied on someone else to do the vetting. Apparently the family is not related to the Borgias; at least, not to any seriously worrying Borgias. And we have talked about some of the extra-curricular activities that pretty young girls sometimes get invited to try. I've seen enough middle-aged English husbands getting pink and sweaty over Scandinavian au pairs to know that lust can be an occupational hazard. Which just leaves her domestic credentials to knock into shape, and now that they're under scrutiny I realise I've not done a very good job at all. I said, ‘I think you should know how to cook a few things, in case they ask you to feed the children,’ but she seemed to think that knowing how to make a Marmite sandwich would be enough. I pressed on. They probably don't have Marmite in Italy. I could see her working out how many jars she'd be able to carry in her hand luggage. I asked my friends who have had au pairs what they'd expected of them in the kitchen. One of them, recently relieved of a large Norwegian and still visibly tense, said she'd lost interest in food and would settle for not having all the cup handles knocked off. Another, a veteran who's been sorting out homesick Latins for years, said it was the greatest treat, once in a while, to get them to cook something just-a like-a Mama used to make. ‘That's the thing,’ she said. ‘Send her off with some traditional British recipes under her belt.’ So the problem is greater than I had first thought. She can't cook, she doesn't especially want to learn to cook, and I have only the sketchiest notion of British cooking. I could show her a bit of Indian, Chinese or Middle Eastern, all heavily adapted, because I like messing around with other people's culinary canons, but mainly I'd have to show her my version of Italian, and the liberties I've taken with that don't bear repetition. Not in Tuscany, at any rate. To show willing she has watched while I've prepared dinner this week. I think she's picked up a few pointers, like how to chop an onion and how to dissolve an Oxo cube. I was going to tell her about proper beef stock, but the girl has to walk before she can run. Her repertoire now consists of Pasta with Meat Sauce, Pasta with Tomato Sauce, and Pasta with Onions but No Sauce. If Yorkshire Pudding ever catches on over there it won't be any fault of mine. Next week we're going to do omelettes, and how to say ‘Please take your hand off my bottom.’ And if time permits we might do the Medicis, and a basic roast chicken. If it comes to the worst, she does a very good Marmite sandwich."
NWS NWS-CH3-103 8.84 "WHY I'VE HAD TO THROW AWAY THAT PHOTO GAZZA sheds more tears for England I cry each time I see the video… ‘I thought the memories might help me. They made it worse’ ‘Being with England has made me realise what I have missed’ NIGEL CLARKE PAUL GASCOIGNE revealed yesterday why he still sheds tears for his beloved England. The man who wept during England's World Cup semi-final with Germany two years ago, now cannot bear to watch himself in the white shirt of his country. And he admits he cries when he sees film of the glory days in Italy when Gazza was ready to become the best footballer in the world. That was before his shattering injury that has taken 16 months off his career. ‘I just can't watch myself,’ he said in Santander yesterday where he has joined up with the England team to watch tonight's match against Spain. ‘I have had to throw the videos away. In those dark days when I was recovering from my knee injury I'd play a video of an England match and upset myself all over again. ‘I have watched David Platt's last-minute winner in the World Cup match against Belgium, and a big lump came in my throat. ‘I thought a few reminiscences might help me. It didn't. Just made it worse. I just wanted to go out and smash a door down. Jokes ‘I will watch the game against Spain because I am not playing. It will be great just to be with the lads again. ‘I have missed it all so much. English voices, the general banter, jokes, comradeship and team spirit. ‘Yes, I have been lonely. I can't wait for the next get-together, and the thought of pulling on that old white shirt again excites me. ‘When I've played a few games for Lazio, when I'm ready and the boss says I am fit to return, I will bring the whole family to Wembley to watch me again. ‘I don't think I have much else to prove…other than that I want to be the best player in the world. ‘My knee is fine. There is no doubt in my mind that I can be the player I was before I got injured. ‘I don't think about my knee. All I know is that I want to give everything I have for England again.’ Gazza, now with Lazio of Rome after his £5.5 million transfer from Tottenham, expects his first match to be against Spurs on September 23. By then he should have fully recovered from the injured right thigh muscle that has delayed his eagerly awaited debut in Italian football. All being well, that should be at home to Genoa the following week. He went on: ‘I am fit. I can run around a pitch 25 times, no problem. I don't know what a beer looks like. ‘I don't think about what the first tackle is going to be like, unless of course it comes from Stuart Pearce! Or the first twist or turn. ‘It will mean so much just to play again. ‘I watched the European championship finals on television but I got down again, disappointed because I wasn't there. ‘But I kept in touch with Graham Taylor and the boys. ‘I involved myself by phoning the hotel to find out from the boss what was going on. ‘I knew I would never be fit to play, but I wanted to be part of it still. ‘I won't put myself forward for England until I have successfully played for Lazio. That would be wrong.’ Taylor has already pencilled in Gazza to play his first match for England in the World Cup qualifier against Norway next month. Gazza added: ‘Going back to Wembley is very much on my mind.’ Talent It was there that he was hurt so badly, rupturing knee ligaments in Spurs' FA Cup final win over Nottingham Forest in May last year. He said: ‘I will think about the thousands who will be watching and how I want to prove people wrong.’ There have been many doubts that Gazza couldn't make a come-back at club level or even contemplate straddling the international scene again with the outrageous talent that made him a folk hero. He said: ‘I came to Italy for something different. To try something new. ‘Of course I still miss the Football League, the chance to get stuck in. You can't do that in Italy without getting booked. ‘But I just love football. I like training and enjoy working out twice a day.’ But Gazza admits he missed Lazio's 3-3 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday that kicked off the Italian season. ‘Where were you?’ he was asked. ‘Did you go shopping?’ ‘No,’ he grinned. ‘I was at home, looking to make babies.’ Gazza is slowly but surely learning the Italian language, making it work for him. He said: ‘There was a dog barking outside my house. It kept on and on. ‘I shouted at it in English but it kept on. ‘So I went through my phrase-book to search for something like ‘Shut up’. ‘I yelled out ‘Silencio, bastardo’. There was immediate silence.’ The old grin is back on his face. That old confident strut and swagger has returned. He said: ‘I am nearly there, so nearly fit, so close. ‘It's been a long time and I am not going to rush it. Pleased ‘Being with the English lads again has made me realise just what I have been without. ‘They were all so pleased to see me. Nobody went on about my injury — just asked me how I was getting along in Italy.’ Gazza cannot wait to be one of them again. And you cannot help keeping your fingers crossed for him. THE ANGUISH OF DEFEAT ENGLAND'S World Cup exit was a sad occasion for Gazza but he's desperately keen to pull on that old white shirt again.

NWS NWS-CH3-224 8.78 "My sacking hurt me, my family and my friends like hell PHIL THOMPSON ON THE CRISIS AT LIVERPOOL NEIL SILVER PHIL Thompson last night described the torment of his sacking by Liverpool. In a frank debate on the Anfield crisis on Sky TV Thompson, former Liverpool skipper and coach, told how his shock sacking had shattered his family. ‘It hurt me, it hurt my family and friends like hell,’ said Thompson. ‘And I've not been given a good reason for it.’ Thompson was backed by former hard-man Liverpool colleague Tommy Smith, who said Thompson should have been given a medal for what he did at Anfield, not the sack. Here is the amazing transcript of the debate, on The Footballers' Football Show, which also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrenson, and which was hosted by presenter Richard Keys. Debate We pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisions. BRIAN HALL: ‘At that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cup, he's got the opportunity of reaching Wembley, he's had a difficult time in the League, it's been a traumatic season okay, then he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39. ‘There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solid, rational decisions. I don't think so under those sort of circumstances.’ TOMMY SMITH: ‘So you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five seconds?’ HALL: ‘No, what I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologised, he's made apologies. I think we ought to make some understanding of the sort of pressures that the man was under at the time when all this happened, and it happened very quickly.’ PHIL THOMPSON: ‘So that mean's I get my job back does it?’ RICHARD KEYS: ‘We should explain that too. Phil, you were on the coaching staff and left in the summer. ‘I understand you've got a legal problem which means we can't go too deeply into that, but from the outside is it hurting you a little bit?’ THOMPSON: ‘It hurts like hell. Reasons for my dismissal were nothing like I think I deserved. I think it lies a little bit deeper.’ SMITH: ‘I think the lad deserved a medal, because they won the Cup with half a reserve side out last year — and he was taking care of the reserves.’ THOMPSON: ‘All I've just said is that it was not a good enough explanation of what I got and I don't think anybody has been told, not only to the media out there, myself who is the most important one. ‘But it hurt me, my family and my friends like hell. And I've not had a good enough reason why — that's all I'm hurting Brian, I don't think that is taking anything too far.’ KEYS: ‘Mark, somewhat distanced from it now, what's you're impression of what's happening at Anfield.’ MARK LAWRENSON: ‘I think the thing you have to say Richard, they've only played eight games. This has happened before and no matter what people say I think in my second year we were about 16th or 17th.’ KEYS: ‘But it is not just a question of what is going on on the park, it's what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previously, ever. LAWRENSON: ‘No but I honestly believe that there are certain members of the Press that are delighted to have a go at Liverpool because of the success that they've had. ‘They are a victim of their own success. It has been absolutely phenomenal, it really has, and now all of a sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the stories. ‘How many games are there left? 34? You know, I don't think he (Souness) has been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been there. ‘So I think it is a bit early to pre-empt things.’ Souness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian club. SMITH: ‘Souness seems to be changing an awful lot. If he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then great, but so far it hasn't been that successful. ‘I know that Liverpool won the FA Cup — thanks to Phil and his reserves, because most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuries. ‘There's a big question mark about how Liverpool train. They go on pasta diets now. If food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 years. ‘An awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly club.’ THOMPSON: ‘The thing with Bill Shankly was that we were always a family and everyone knew each other from the cleaning lady to the girls in the ticket office. It was something special.’ PHIL Thompson is still bitter at the way he was treated at Anfield. SMITH: ‘Thompson deserved medal’ LAWRENSON: ‘Too early to judge’ SOUNESS: Upset some Anfield fans"
NWS NWS-CH3-275 5.41 "I'M DOING IT FOR YOU MICHAEL FANZINE special on the force that's driving Eubank Respect for fallen hero IAN GIBB CHRIS EUBANK couldn't help himself — the words of tribute to Michael Watson came tumbling out in a torrent, a year to the Saturday since he put the brave Londoner into a coma. Forgotten, momentarily, were the lumps and bumps and soreness of his face after the punishment he took from game but limited American challenger Tony Thornton in Glasgow on Saturday night. Today is the actual anniversary of the tragic night in Tottenham when Eubank crushed Watson — and it is only recently that the Islington fighter has started to make a real recovery. Just the mention of his name started Eubank off. ‘What a blinding man, and I'm so very pleased that Michael is seeming to make an amazing recovery. ‘I've spoken to him a few times and he's the epitome of a true warrior. He still wants to fight, believes he still has it in him to fight. ‘He's still sharp, has a sense of humour, he's witty. He's bitter about what happened — he didn't want to lose. He hated that. ‘But I got punched to pieces that night and the only reason I won the fight was that I could still keep going in the 12th round. Brilliant ‘Since that day it hasn't looked too good for Michael, certainly not five or six months ago. Now he's brilliant. He said to me: ‘Bring the championship belt and a camera.’ ‘I'd willingly give him the belt but he wouldn't take it. The difference between us is that I don't like this boxing business — and he still loves it, even now. ‘He keeps telling me that I must fight every contender and mustn't dodge anyone. He says as a champion I must perform well and give the public value for money. Then he says: ‘Are you ready for the re-match. Are you up to it?’ ‘He's still a warrior in his mind and you can't break his spirit. He will keep on trying to finish on his feet.’ Yet questions have to be asked quite seriously about whether Eubank himself can maintain his work-rate with a tenth world title fight lined up in just 24 months. He faces yet another challenge for his WBO super- middleweight crown in Manchester on November 28. But I think it's all to do with Watson, the man he now respects so much. Eubank would fight every week if he could to make his fortune secure as soon as possible. Yet on Saturday night he may have run away from a million dollar showdown with Iran Barkley, a man Nigel Benn once conquered, now the IBF champion at 12 stone. Barkley's handler, Stan Hoffman, was in Glasgow to run the rule over Eubank — and he wasn't impressed. He said: ‘I could not sell a Eubank-Barkley fight in the States after that performance. ‘All that running away in the last couple of rounds, it was crazy — an American TV audience wouldn't like it.’ Eubank's promoter Barry Hearn may have different ideas, and is thinking of trying to put Barkley on against Eubank in Britain. That's even though the British Boxing Board have already ruled out Barkley from fighting here because of eye retina damage. If that fell down Hearn might think of staging such a fight in France. But that wouldn't happen until some time next year when Eubank could also be facing Nigel Benn — especially if Benn lifts the WBC title in Italy next month. Eubank looked as though he was going to finish off Thornton in the ninth round — and should have done so in the tenth. But he admitted: ‘I couldn't stay with his pace and I had to get away and look after myself.’ Thornton was not impressed by that tactic. He said: ‘What was the speed limit in the ring during those last couple of rounds? He ran his ass off! It must be wondered whether Eubank is jaded through having so many fights at a high level in such a short time. But it won't get any easier as Hearn promises: ‘We're only going to fight sluggers and tough guys. That may sound mercenary because Chris knows the rest of his career is limited, but it will be fun for people watching! Eubank insists: ‘I HAVE to fight. I NEED to fight. I WANT to fight — on November 28. Yet even Eubank, deep down, does question his continuation in a sport that he has never really liked. He said: ‘It's nice to have a record of 33 wins in 33 fights, but in a way it is becoming tedious and I'm tired of winning all the time. ‘You can have too much of a good thing — but the alternative is quite unacceptable…defeat.’ If he keeps pushing himself so hard, that unacceptable facet of boxing might have to be faced sooner or later. Thornton wasn't quite good enough to take his title, but Eubank might soon be so tired that someone, somewhere, will catch up with him. WHAT A BELTER! STILL champ — but deep down Chris Eubank knows how close it was against punching postman Tony Thornton CHRIS makes his point to the fans EU better watch out — Thornton throws a left FLASHBACK one year — and joy that was soon to turn to despair for Eubank, with Michael Watson moments away from collapse Pictures: CHRIS GRIEVE"
NWS NWS-K3A-026 5.12 "Join us plea to Keane KEVIN MORAN today urged Irish pal Roy Keane to join him at Blackburn Rovers. The Nottingham Forest midfielder is stalling over a £4m move. Although he has agreed personal terms with Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish and been offered a lucrative four-year contract, Arsenal and Manchester United are also chasing the young star. Moran said: ‘Director Jack Walker's money has enabled the manager to put down a good foundation and if we can get Roy coming in alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, the club will really be going places.’ Deborah Wintle: It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ Nina Rowlands: ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ by JANET TANSLEY WHEN it comes to parenthood more and more women are deciding to go it alone. FOR some a broken-down relationship means they have no choice: Others simply long for motherhood without the commitment of marriage or a steady relationship. BUT what happens when the father of the child demands access? What are her or his rights? IT'S a dilemma facing more and more women. They want the baby but not the father. The reasons are many. Either the man she is with is not ready for a long-term commitment, he may be violent and she wants to keep him away from the child. Or she may simply have opted for motherhood without the father which normally completes the traditional ‘set’. Either way they are a growing group, especially on Merseyside which has many unmarried mums. Explains Deborah Wintle, an advice worker and counsellor for Liverpool One Parent Families Trust: ‘There are a number of unmarried mums on Merseyside, many of which we see coming into the Trust. ‘A lot more women are making the conscious decision not to get married, for whatever reason. They want the child but not the relationship that goes with it. ‘The way we see marriage has changed. People decide not to get married but to go ahead and have children anyway. For some the relationship has broken down, others have never been with the father. ‘But today's more liberal attitudes mean they have the freedom to do that. It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ There can be problems, women may have to work harder to maintain a standard of living, but support normally offered by the father can be obtained, says Deborah, 23, from family and friends. Deborah, from Aigburth, herself is a lone parent with a three-year-old little girl, Rebecca, so she knows the problems women face. One is if the father wants to see the child. Few women know where they stand. Says Deborah: ‘We have had women in this situation and it can be disturbing for them and the child. ‘The father may have been violent, the woman might be involved with someone else who has taken on the role of father. ‘When this happens they don't know what to do or where to go.’ We asked Liverpool-based Goldsmith Williams' solicitor Nina Roland, who writes the Echo Woman Extra's LE Law column where these women stand when it comes to the question of access. Says Nina: ‘The immediate answer is that if the couple are not married the mother has all the rights the father has none. ‘He would have to apply to the courts for any access. ‘And he certainly can't demand to see the child when and where he wants, say every weekend.’ Yet while the mother has all the rights invested in her, the courts will be amenable. Says Nina: ‘Unless there is a valid reason why the man should not see the child, then the courts will probably grant some sort of access. ‘It may be once a week or once a fortnight perhaps, but it wouldn't be a lengthy period until the baby is older and more independent. ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ But it is important that the baby doesn't become a tug of love in between two warring parents. And it is always better to settle out of court, says Nina. ‘It is far better for you, and the child, to come to an agreement outside the court system, than get involved in a legal battle. Best for child ‘If you have a good reason why you don't want the father to see your baby then you will be able to put your case to the courts. ‘At the end of the day you have got to decide what is best not just for you but for your child. ‘Remember, the new Children's Act gives them rights too and a court will usually consider that it is in the child's interest to know both parents where possible and reasonable.’ Not surprisingly, the access granted can often depend on whether the child is a girl or boy. Says Nina: ‘If it's a girl the courts often deem she needs her mum's influence. But boys are thought to need a man around …’ Deborah adds: ‘While the legal situation makes things clearer this is obviously an emotional problem and it can help to talk things through. ‘Sometimes there may be bitterness between the mother and father but we can help put things into perspective. ‘It may better if the child can get to know both parents where possible, even though many unmarried mums are happier on their own.’"
NWS NWS-K5C-038 4.28 "THE UNEMPLOYED No.4, top floor: NATALIE HUNTER, 27, has been unemployed since December after working as a graphic designer for four years. She is looking for work and thinks she may be forced to move to London in search of a job. She has also considered re-training and thought about enrolling for a college course. She feels the worst part of being unemployed is her inability to plan for the future. ‘At first it was quite good having loads of time, and money wasn't really a problem, I just stopped buying things. However, it's easy to get a very negative self-image and lose your confidence. ‘It's still a social stigma to be unemployed and employers wonder what you've been doing.’ She is appalled by the suggestion that the unemployed should work for their dole money. ‘It's really terrible. People should be entitled to basic benefits.’ No.4, ground floor: ELECTRA SCORGIE, 33, is an unemployed rock musician who is attending a training course on computers. An American who has lived in Britain for 15 years, she has experienced the ‘devastating’ effects of unemployment. ‘If you're forced to live on benefits you're thrown on to such a low level that you can't dress properly for interviews or even afford the travel involved. ‘You don't have the sort of upbeat good humour you need to compete for jobs. ‘There doesn't seem to be any safety net for laying people off and there is the belief put about by certain politicians that full employment would cause inflation to rise. It's all very manipulative.’ She feels people in Scotland who have lost their jobs are not so eager to find work because wages are low, whereas in the States people are prepared to do two or three part-time jobs to support themselves. She is not impressed at the concept of working for dole money and says it might be a better idea to give people a minimum wage for doing community work. No.24 THE SIX residents of Thornybauk hostel for those with alcohol-related problems are all unemployed and will begin looking for work once they have dealt with their difficulties. Hamish Reilly, 35, worked for an electronics firm in Livingston before moving into the hostel 14 months ago. He is not optimistic about his chances of getting another job in electronics and says he would consider doing something else. ‘There are a lot of people out there looking, it's a bit of a joke really.’ Morag French, 27, is more optimistic about a job, although she did experience a few brief spells of unemployment before entering the hostel a year and a half ago. No.2, first floor: LISA, 18, is a student of English who has been unemployed twice, including being made redundant when only 16. ‘Unemployment is really degrading, I felt like I wanted to spend money all the time to cheer myself up, but of course I didn't have anything left over from my bridging allowance. My mum helped me out a bit, but not everyone has parents who will help. The Government should back up young people more because there are those who have to leave home.’ ‘Even if you get a flat you worry about delays in your housing benefit. It's all right if you've got a nice landlord who'll wait for the payment to come through. ‘If not it's just another hassle you face if you're on the dole.’ No.4, ground floor: GILLIAN LEDSON, 19, is a retail business student who has had the experience of being made unemployed twice in five weeks. Her summer job at Harrods in London lasted only one week after poor sales in the sports department meant she was no longer needed. Working in Habitat on Kings Road proved to be depressingly similar and again Ms Ledson was paid off, that time after three weeks. ‘Unemployment is very likely to cause people a lot of stress and I feel quite concerned about how depressed friends can become when unemployed. ‘I don't think people should have to work for their dole money, although some sort of ‘workfare’ programme might help some people in terms of references or whatever.’ No.4: ROGER LINTON, 27, is manager of Dunbar's tourist information centre and was unemployed for three and a half months before finding a job. ‘Although he feels his job is secure in spite of forthcoming local government reorganisation, he has not forgotten how his brief spell of unemployment affected him. ‘There are two sides to unemployment, on the one hand it can be a productive time as you start to question things and think harder about what road you want to go down. ‘However, it can also make you disorientated and you start to apply for less and less appropriate jobs as you get desperate. You start to see yourself in terms of an application form.’ Like others in the street, he is not enchanted with the idea of working for dole money. ‘To me it sounds similar to youth training schemes — a disgrace. ‘Some sort of scheme would be reasonable, but only if there was training involved and a decent wage.’ No.11: DIANE LECKIE, 39, is divorced, with a daughter and works as a teacher. She vividly recalls being made redundant several years ago. ‘I felt devastated at losing my job. I had gone through a marriage break-up and had a lot of financial commitments.’ ‘I had worked in recruitment so I knew what I was in for: it can be a nightmare.’ She feels there is a real shortage of teaching jobs and says if she were to lose her job tomorrow she would want to do something. ‘I would try and turn my hand to anything but it must be very hard if you leave school at 15.’ No.12: MATHEW REA works in Edinburgh University's chemical engineering department and his wife Jenny Haslam works as a part-time social worker. They have two young children and moved to Edinburgh after Mr Rea experienced difficulty in finding work in Sheffield. He says being unemployed meant feeling cut off. ‘One of the things I missed was having access to things like phones and being able to make contacts.’ His wife mentions lack of status. Mr Rea says jobs at universities are no longer as secure as they once were. ‘People are often taken on short-term contracts, proper jobs are very hard to come by. There are a lot of very qualified people who can only find work on a short-term basis.’"
NWS NWS-K5C-058 9.83 "Resourceful woman of powerful persuasion WHATEVER the good intentions and fine words about women doing anything a man can do, there are still industries where men would be surprised to find themselves dealing with a woman. Grace Buckley, Scottish-Power's most senior woman executive, doesn't let it worry her. As fuel and by-products manager, she is responsible for buying all the fuel the electricity giant uses — coal, oil, gas or even slurry — and selling the by-products of electricity, such as ash. Her opposite numbers are almost all men. ‘If there are any advantages it comes from the background. The reaction from the other side of the table is different because you are a woman, they expect you to do it a different way.’ Buckley probably does do it differently, working towards less confrontation and for a solution that will last. ‘That doesn't mean they will get an easier deal,’ she laughs. The bruised executives of British Coal would testify to that after their run-in over the coal contract which ended up in court. Buckley is unrepentant, arguing that what remains of the Scottish coal industry now has a more secure future. ‘Somebody had to take a stand. We were expected to put our hands in our pockets and shell out regardless of whether or not we were getting value for money. Perhaps we were seen as abrasive because we had the courage to say what everyone else was thinking.’ Buckley has been in this job since 1988 and in the department since 1981, but she started as a lawyer in private practice, a profession where equality is far more of a reality than in industry. She joined the old South of Scotland Electricity Board in 1976 as a legal assistant — the first female solicitor it had employed — but by 1980 wanted to do something different and went back to university with the company's blessing (and a scholarship) to get an MBA. When she came back she was put into contracts and purchasing in the knowledge that she was a potential candidate for management succession , although no promises were made. ‘I was the right person in the right place at the right time.’ Buckley says she has never been aware of a problem of discrimination in the company, at least in a corporate sense, ‘but I think a lot of men found it a problem’. ‘When I first started going to open-cast sites I was unusual and it was pretty well guaranteed to stop operations in their tracks.’ Going first meant that Buckley did not have any role models or even mentors. ‘I just look at whoever is in the job ahead. It is a question of whether they are good at managing. If they are you use them as a role model.’ She knows that by virtue of her position many women see her as a role model and so is happy to give advice when asked for it. Any problems she has encountered have not been because of her gender, but because she has had older people working for her. ‘What happens when women engineers come through may be a different matter. They are dealing with power station staff and other engineers who don't make any allowances for you. If you get sat on it is because you allow yourself to be sat on. It is not because you are female.’ In any case she thinks it is just a matter of time before more women start coming through to senior levels, both because the company is taking on more female graduates and because they are a pretty self-confident lot anyway. ‘One of the women who works for me is one of the toughest women I have ever come across, and most of the women graduates are more than competent. There are a lot of good young women coming up.’ WHERE difficulties can occur is in the matter of families. Buckley, who is unmarried, admits that being successful in business is easier for a woman who has no children. It is still assumed that it is the woman who will give up work to look after the children or take time off if they are sick, she admits. ‘If you are going to be in senior job you are going to put a lot of time in so you give up your social life a bit perhaps. You feel pressure not to be seen to fail in the job. You have got to show you are at least as good and a little bit extra to cover your back.’ Like many women who have crashed through the glass ceiling — or, perhaps, ignored it — she is strongly opposed to positive discrimination in favour of women and has little time for the argument that women don't succeed because they are women. ‘It is almost certainly the case you have to do a little bit extra because you are female but you don't have to prove you are twice as good.’ But how will we know when the glass ceiling has gone. ‘I suppose equality will come when you no longer notice whether it is a man or a woman across the table.’ Buyer of all she surveys: Grace Buckley finds coal comfort"
