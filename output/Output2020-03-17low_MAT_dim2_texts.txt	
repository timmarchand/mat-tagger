HOC HOC-MZ -0.11 " I am outraged that they would even consider trying to ban him, what sort of society are we living in people should have the freedom to listen to what they want just like having the freedom of speech if you don't like it don't listen but don't try and impress your views on everyone else this is the 21st century after all. Long live Eminem.      Elizabeth, UK I agree that Eminem's lyrics are shocking but that is exactly what they are supposed to be. Everything he talks about happens every day. Banning him would be banning telling the truth, shocking as it may be, and what kind of example is that setting to children? My argument is the problem is not with Eminem but with the society that gives him his material.      Are people not allowed to entertain fiction within music. If I wrote a song about violence it does not necessarily mean I am violent or that I really advocate it. Is this sort of fiction only allowed to authors of literature. If our children took more notice of literature would we ban them from reading certain books.      I'm 16, I love modern music and freedom of expression, but having listened to Eminem, I must say I was deeply disturbed, not by the language but the content. He seems to be becoming an idol for those younger than me, a fact which I am not comfortable with. Should Eminem be banned? No. But stronger controls on the music that young children are allowed to buy need to be introduced.      Eminem is a talentless offensive idiot but to ban him would just play into his own hands by giving him the publicity he craves. (Anyone remember Frankie Goes to Hollywood?) Much as I loathe his music and bigoted opinions you can't ban something just because you don't agree with it.      Thanks to this bigot, after being a citizen for 26 years in the US, his fans racially taunted my daughter. Thank you Eminem, but there will be backlash somewhere, I for one will stand up against hooligans like you.      I don't think his music should be banned. If parents train their children with strong morals and values, then they don't have to worry what they listen to in music or stuff at school. Kids are very smart, they know what's right from wrong. Long live freedom of speech.      Instead of banning Eminem, who has talent and originality to his works, can we please ban manufactured dross like Steps, S-Club 7 and that (ugh) new band coming out in ""Popstars""?      Whether or not he should be banned is a question I am uneasy with. However I would say that the popularity of this debate has given the opportunity for many of us to question our own beliefs on to what extent individuals should get away with expressing bigotry on groups in society.      It's the media again, stirring things up! Fortunately, not all people believe what the papers want us to believe. I believe in freedom of expression. If he had a difficult childhood it's good he can express it through song. Considering that most pop songs are really meaningless without any depth, this type is more interesting although not exactly run of the mill.      Yes - Eminem should be banned as he promotes and celebrates 'thug culture'. However, banning him will just guarentee his popularity, so we should not grant him the centre of attention that he so obviously wants. I suggest a media blackout.      Its a straight censorship question. We (nearly) all understand the sense in categorising films as 18,15, PG etc. and all understand the thinking behind the TV 9 p.m. watershed. There is no case for banning Eminem, parental control and censorship to protect the young and impressionable is required.      All this has certainly got my mother up in arms, that's all I can say!      The concert at Manchester was excellent, the albums are fantastic, he is just so cute, wears the most wonderful clothes and has got to be the most talented person to come out of the USA ever. Why does anyone want to ban him? The men who do are jealous, the women who do need to lighten up. On a more serious note, freedom of speech is a terribly important thing, and never ever to be taken lightly, whatever you believe.      I went to the show last night in London and it was amazing, you can't ban Eminem, so many people like him, it wouldn't be fair, you'd be depriving a large majority of people, just because some people over-analyse his lyrics!      Please don't ban him. I'll be forced to go out and buy the CD... and I don't like rap. I guess I could put it on the shelf next to the Sex Pistols and Spycatcher.      Since when did the state have the option to decide what music we listen to. On that basis, we should ban a whole series of controversial books, films, videos. Maybe we could have big bonfires to burn all the banned material, and find someone to blame, and persecute them! I think that the 'moral majority' should see this for what it really is - cheap, tacky publicity and sales promotion. And by calling for it to be banned, they are actually giving the record company some of the best publicity of all! Come on, people, let's not play in to their hands!      I have a 13 year old daughter who loves Eminem. Though a lot of his lyrics are his own personal thoughts and lifetime experiences, I took the step to ban her from playing the CD in the garden last summer as we have elderly neighbours and when my nieces (8 and 5) are around. You can't stop them listening to the radio and watching TV. I am surprised that Stan wasn't banned by the BBC completely. I don't think it is a real problem, after all we had the Sex Pistols in the 1970s didn't we?      Eminem is the best. Don't ban him from the UK.     I have always believed that music represents the era we are living in. We do not live in a nice Barbie world, we live among all those things Eminem sings about so why hide from reality? Why refuse that part of the truth Eminem sings about? Sad, hard to cope with, unjust, but still true.      After watching Eminem live in Manchester I was blown away by the sheer presence of the world's biggest music figure. Eminem is truly a lyrical genius.      Hitler used censorship to control Germany in WWII, and the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees freedom of speech. Alongside that is freedom not to listen. I am gay, and have also been beaten up for it, but music doesn't make people homophobic. I say let Eminem rock - I enjoy his music.      Most definitely not, shall we have a poll to ban free speech as well? The music is dull but the lyrics tell a different story of a man who has been ignored by the very people who need to open their eyes      I remember about 30 years ago a similar fuss about Alice Cooper's 'controversial' stage show - he used a guillotine on stage and faked executions. The shock, the horror! But did all of us who went to these concerts come out and murder people? I think not. Have some regard for the intelligence of the audience. My 15 year old daughter is a fan, but has the sense to realise that 'Slim Shady' is simply a persona, an alter-ego. For God's sake, everyone get a grip - do you really want to ban music you don't like??      I am at Sheffield Uni and believe the ban to be undemocratic, pointless and misguided. Yes he talked about 'killing faggots', then in another song said 'there's no reason a man and another man can't elope'. These songs are old fashioned morality plays that provoke discussion. Censorship is a morally bankrupt process that prevents discussion. Long live freedom of speech.      If Eminem had not released his singles. Then we would never have heard of Dido. So just ignore him and listen to Dido. Much better      Never heard of him before seeing this item.      Eminem is only expressing his thoughts and feelings through music. Maybe that's the only way for him to do so in order for the people to listen to his problems.      It is a sad so see yet another high profile bigot emerge and enjoy such seemingly blind widespread support from the many and justification for his apparent bigotry from the few. In April it will be the anniversary of the London nail bomber outrages that resulted in scores of injuries and in the deaths of two gay men and a pregnant straight woman who embraced diversity. I knew one of the two gay men who were murdered. The apparent misogynistic and homophobic ranting of Eminem in his lyrics gives succour to those who are filled with irrational hate and fear and who are the cause of countless gay bashing and male on female violence each and everyday. There is a fine line between freedom of speech and the freedom to spout hatred towards certain groups. It seems sad that we even have to worry about banning such a person in the first place.      Because he's white there are many offensive words such as the racist N---word that Eminem probably would never dare use in his lyrics! But it has been used by many other black hip-hop artists like Public Enemy, NWA and the Fugees. Some of these artists have used very racist anti-white comments in their music, and I remember one rap star commenting ""my music is dedicated to blacks only, and is not intended for whites"". Can you imagine the uproar if Eminem said that about blacks? I am not racist myself and I don't support any kind of offensive comments but if Eminem was black we would not be having this discussion!      Gosh, Guy Ritchie's films aren't terribly wholesome either. Could you please ban him too?      Am I the only gay Eminem fan? There must be more of us out there. His music is brilliant, Kim is an amazing track, it is really disturbing to listen to. The fact that a song enrages such emotions is definitely a good thing. Music (art) has so much more potential than the bubblegum pop that rules the charts today. Let him be, think of it as a performance and if you don't like him, don't listen to him. I will gladly turn off the radio if the all-so-familiar tones of Westlife start to play.      Martin Price made a good point but came to the wrong conclusion. Respect to his 12 year old son for finding the lyrics sick and vulgar and for choosing not to listen to them. But this only goes to show that the buying public are not zombies and can make up their own minds about right and wrong. Likewise I do not agree with the content of the lyrics but I like and listen to the music for its shock value.      In the 60's they tried to ban the Beatles for references to drugs. In the 70's they tried to ban The Sex Pistols for references to the Queen. Then, as now, people have a choice to either listen or to not listen. Eminem's controversial stance may have upset certain fractions of society, but the guy is speaking his mind. We live in a democracy and I believe if he has something to say, let him say it.      Ignore him and he'll go away.      No don't ban him. But his music is dull and his lyrics shallow and infantile. Rap is a subcultural cul-de-sac. I have seen him compared to real poets (Keats, Shelley etc) which makes me alternately cringe and howl with laughter.      Why does Martin Price allow his 12 year-old child to buy CDs with an explicit lyrics warning on the cover?      Moral outrage at Eminem's lyrics is misplaced. In truth they are an outpouring of despair and anger at the lack of love or meaning in Eminem's life. Eminem is a product of today's society - a society we all bear the responsibility for. If we wish to sweep Eminem's words under the carpet it is more out of a desire to hide the moral failure in our own hearts.      Definitely not banned, don't be silly, let the protesters protest as they are legally allowed to and let him write his lyrics as he's legally allowed to      What is the point in banning him when people will just listen to him on the Internet or by buying pirate albums, further damaging the music industry.      Why ban him? If you don't like his views or music you're not forced to listen. I personally don't advocate his views but at least they're invoking a debate.      Yes he should be banned. If this is music, then we have all been conned. Even my 12 year old son (who bought one of his CDs) agrees that the lyrics are sick, vulgar and total rubbish and that he is obviously just out for 'cheap publicity' by trying to shock everybody. Well unfortunately in this day and age it doesn't work. My son now uses his CD as a coffee mug mat which he says is the best place for it !!!      Wake up Britain! Have you never listened to the lyrics of songs by Tom Jones, Elvis Presley etc, all 'respectable' musicians? Try 'Delilah' for a start - it's about stabbing someone. Eminem is just more explicit and the current climate is more disposed towards self-expression. Violence has always been in music and always will be. You can always turn the radio off.      For the record, I think his music is no better or worse than the rest of the 'Gangsta Rap' genre, although I thought 'My Name Is..' was funny. He is no more a threat than Ozzie Osbourne was when the Parents Music Resource Centre in the US went after him. This is all about censorship, and people wanting a squeaky clean world with everyone having the same opinions. The world isn't like that. Get used to it.      I saw Eminem on Friday in London and was blown away by the whole show. He has so much talent and basically made a lot of people very happy that night. There was no violence or trouble at the gig and to be honest, if Britain became a country that was able to take that away from me then I wouldn't want to live here. Thank you Eminem, the memories will last longer than the controversy.      Sure, let's ban him. And while we're at it, well I don't like Cliff Richard, so ban him too. And boy bands, they really get on my nerves, so can we ban them as well? How about anyone who's ever had a lyric I disagree with - can we ban them too?      Well, let us all think for ourselves. I think he's great.      I think the sort of people that are offended by Eminem are all too easily offended. The likes of Tatchell have whopping chips on their shoulders and are continually looking for media attention. Much of Eminem's output is quite responsible, as well as displaying real creative genius. He is entertaining to those that like to hear it, and that ultimately is the business he is in. Anybody who has their prejudices reinforced by his lyrics will find approval for their views wherever they look.      Is anyone seriously suggesting that this horrendous stuff is music? It sounds so awful that I have to turn my radio off as soon as I hear it. I'd rather listen to my washing machine!      Believe me, there is a lot worse than Eminem in the world of rap. Let the man get on with his music and get a life!The rest of us have the right to listen and see what we want and that is thanks to that thing called FREEDOM.      To ban someone so minuscule and meaningless as Eminem is silly but to condone his spiteful contempt, just because we can't ""mirror his bigotry"", is simply irresponsible. We should highlight his primitive shortcomings in civilised public discourse instead, there is enough written of him. We cannot in any way give credibility to misogyny and homophobia.      In spite of what he says, the man has not committed a crime (unlike Mike Tyson, whom you did let in). Any nation that calls itself free cannot block anyone from entry simply because the words they say or sing.      Eminem must be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever people have to say about him, good or bad, it's all publicity which is exactly what he wants. He's not the first artist to be controversial and the more he offends people, the more records he sells. He shouldn't be banned because he's not exactly a threat to society, just a rapper who everyone will get bored with eventually.      I believe that the university was right to ban him from performing, as there are opinions highlighted in his music that conflict with those set out by the institution. This certainly does not amount to censorship. Preventing him from appearing in the public forum is a different matter. That said it is difficult to see how his songs do not have a negative influence given the age groups of the children that I have heard listening to and repeating the lyrics in his music.      I think he is a superb artist and poet. The first rap artist to make me sit up and listen to what is being said. ""Stan"" and ""Kim"" on the latest album are quite exceptional pieces of art. Why shouldn't he rap about his own life? He is not telling you to do it. He is a musician/rapper/whatever you want to call him who paints pictures with his music. We all watch horror films, slasher movies, psychological thrillers, real life dramas....this is the soundtrack.      I think that too many people take Eminem too seriously. Many forget that not everything that is recorded on a CD is the truth. Do we really believe that S Club 7 can ""Reach For The Stars"", or that Britney Spears is actually ""Crazy""?      I think at some point or another you see a rising of a star profile ...which Eminem embraces proudly. Its the uniqueness of his music and lyrics that make people listen to it and relate to their own life ... another great speaker was the late Tupac; provocative lyrics about the society and injustices but true to certain extend. I think the rage in his music is the kind of inner instinct that probably everybody has it but afraid of letting it out.      If I stood in the middle of a city protesting how much I hate Gays/Blacks/Disabled/police, would I really be allowed to continue by a crowd who says ""oh, we live in a country of free expression, lets listen"" or would I be arrested for public order offences or would I just be beaten up? What do you think?      I think that banning Eminem is a terrible idea, his latest album was a best-seller in the UK last year. Also, banning Eminem will only encourage more people (especially teenagers) to listen to him as a way of rebelling. Finally, just because people listen to his music it does not mean they share the same views as him.      I thought we live in a free country with freedom of speech. Ban a musician? Then we are no better than Hitler.      While I personally find Eminem's music nihilist and atonal, I think banning his music is a knee-jerk reaction that belies the root cause of youth violence and rage. It is all too simple for the Government to ban music, art or writing that highlights the views of antisocial individuals. Such conduct allows them to maintain the image of taking action, without having to actually acknowledge and forge solutions to societal problems. The more things change, the more they stay the same.      Surely the mere fact we are discussing this means that Eminem has done a good job. For him all publicity is good publicity, if he believes what he says then good, but chances are he says it too sell records and he seems to have it down to a fine art.      The government's recent comments ring true here. We should ban a man (Eminem) who has committed no crime, yet we didn't ban a man (Tyson) who has. Banning someone because you disagree with his opinions is the first step towards totalitarianism, where perhaps people are barred from religious expression because they are Jewish? Let's stop the rot before it starts.      I don't like Eminem but that does ""not"" mean that he should be banned. If Eminem doesn't like homosexuality, as far as I am concerned there is nothing wrong with him voicing his opinion. We should be free to make our own choices about what we ourselves consider acceptable.      Censorship at this level is a bad thing because it could lead on to other stuff being banned too. This is the 21st Century, grow up! If it offends you, don't listen to it but, don't try to stop everyone else listening, and allowing them to form their own opinions.      He should be praised, not banned. My mother said to me a few days ago that he says ""disgusting things"". It's no more than would see or hear in an 18-certificate movie. His lyrics can be seen as offensive, but I prefer to think of them as challenging. He's just trying to express his opinion, and he has every right to do so. And anyway, if people don't want to listen to him, don't listen to him!      My 13 year old son listens to Eminem in much the same way that I listened to David Bowie. The last thing that will stop teenagers listening to this unsavoury character is people like me or the Government banning him. You may as well have him deified.      Stonewall claim Eminem doesn't rail against black people because ""he's scared of them"". Hasn't it occurred to them that he might be homophobic but not racist or is that notion too dangerous for them to contemplate? Let him play and let people be given the credit for coming to their own conclusions.      Certainly not until we ban Steps and all the rest of the boy/girl band ""fall in love"" lyrics that are doing far more damage to society than Eminem. I personally am sick of the politically correct brigade objecting to freedom of speech when it doesn't suit their cocooned little world....      Whatever happened to freedom of expression. Just because a person listens to something it does not mean they have to agree with it. If individuals mirror this bigoted behaviour then those individuals should be punished. Has Sheffield SU banned all literature holding racist or homophobic views from it's libraries?      To be honest, I would rather see a ban on the soulless and talent-free drivel from teeny boy-bands that pollute the airwaves. Here is a man who raps with an astounding lyrical dexterity and talent that is remarkably refreshing today. As for accusations of homophobia and sexism. I think Eminem is an equal-opportunities hater, his rage is directed at all groups - himself included. He is just very, very angry. Fortunately he creates awesome music from his rage. As for M Fox claiming he ""ruined"" Dido's tune: listen to the song, actually listen to the lyrics and you will see that they, combined with the story of the chorus, have a haunting tragedy that Dido is probably pretty proud of.      Should we ban Eminem? No because he has talent! He may have questionable morals but he does have ability. No one ever talks about banning the likes of the Spice Girls and Westlife and all these other ridiculous excuses for pop groups. So why ban someone whose famous because he is talented rather than because a faceless record company executive said ""make it so!""      And here I was, thinking that censorship was a thing of the past and that we now live in a tolerant and multi-cultural society. Oh well, guess I was wrong. I'm ashamed to admit that I did my degree in Sheffield as I was always proud of how the university claimed to accept all cultures and beliefs. I didn't realise that this was on the proviso that they didn't offend the ears of the chattering classes.      Personally I think that his attitude stinks and that he is probably a xenophobe. His music is awful - look what he did to Dido's song to turn it into Stan.     Make your own decisions, take your own risks, be responsible for the outcome of your own decisions. No-one is forced to do anything they don't want. If you don't like his music then switch it off but you have no right to force others to do the same.      Having actually been beaten up, just for being gay, I say yes ban him.      I do not think you can ban someone on the principle that you should never block freedom of expression. What saddens me is that people are willing to fall for Eminem's undoubtable skill for marketing himself and his image.      On behalf of the entire United States, I apologise to the UK for creating the market for Eminem. Unintelligence has become somewhat of a fad in the US these days and, of course, if you want to be stupid, you have to be smart. This is exactly why Eminem will never make fun of or write lyrics depicting African Americans in a negative light. If he does, his career is over. Listen with an open mind, but always remember what your own personal values have brought you.      While Eminem's lyrics might not be to everyone's taste, I do find this hysteria a bit disturbing. He's a pop artist - nothing more. If Sheffield SU can't see that for what it is then that's their business but I do believe that the rest of us can make up our own minds. If you don't like him, don't buy a ticket to his shows or buy his records.      I'm sure the same thing was said of the Beastie Boys when they first swore in an interview on national TV. The band were criticised as aggressive, their lyrics declared misogynist and their behaviour condemned as abhorrent and something to be discouraged for fear that our young may replicate the image. Eminem's music is simply representative of modern day images transmitted to our screens on a daily basis. Sad, but unfortunately true. To ban the US rapper from the UK would be highly hypocritical given the present state of the medium of television and cinema.      I think that Eminem is a fount of misplaced rage. He is so self-conscious about his own life that he sings about it to comfort himself. I believe that some of his work is very good but other bits are just mass produced over-commercialised songs with no meaning or thought about the effect that they may have on the audience which he operates in. I am sitting on the fence on this one but he would not be where he is if he wasn't talented would he?      Surely we learned something from the ""Frankie Goes to Hollywood"" fiasco some years ago, when attempts by DJ Mike Read to ban the song ""Relax"" caused sales to jump and the song to go to . Ignore Eminem and he will go away. Make a fuss and he's here to stay. (Gosh that rhymes !!!)      No! Eminem should not be banned. I believe that people have the right to express themselves through their music. It is up to the listening public to choose whether any viewpoint is a valid one in each person's belief system. If we begin to censor music then it will become less expressive as a result of musicians being scared of censorship. It is my view that music is a way of communicating your emotions without them being taken literally. It is when music IS taken literally that we see arguments and problems related to its message.      Of course it should be banned, along with all the other songs with naughty words. We should only listen to government approved music. Nanny knows best.      The only thing that should be banned is banning things.      What use will banning Eminem do? People already listen to his music, and have every right to do so. Banning it will make it seem 'glamorous' and therefore attract the more suggestible of the population. Also, we failed to ban convicted rapist Mike Tyson from fighting in the UK even though the law said we should - so why should we ban someone who hasn't even committed a crime? One law for all and freedom of choice and expression - that's what we need.      A little more publicity won't hurt now will it?      The best thing about the ban is that it has certainly got people talking about the issue. I think his lyrics are disgusting and highlighting them will show him up for the nasty little man he is. Remember Shabba Ranks - another homophobic bigoted rapper? No? Pop stars come and go and the quicker Eminem goes the better! I commend Sheffield for raising the issue. I have my own personal ban on my car radio.      No Eminem shouldn't be banned - the content of his songs are not for the faint-hearted I admit, but he's a performer - it's a role. Should we ban all press for Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" due to the extreme nature of the character? Let's give up on the ""nanny state"" and live in the twenty-first century for goodness sake! Many radio stations already bleep out or dip the sound on portions of the songs already as they break (or at least stretch) broadcasting rules and codes of conduct. My advice - if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Personally I find it some of the most interesting music I have come across in a long time.      Yes - but only because his ""music"" is horrible!      M and M's? They're only like Smarties and they haven't been banned!      I think that if we were all brain dead drones then maybe he should be banned. Since we are not and CAN THINK FOR OURSELVES, I believe that we can choose for ourselves too.      No, he shouldn't be banned "
HOC HOC-CP -0.09 " I've worked in the aircraft industry for over 35 years. I held an FAA Repairman's License, Airframe rating. On takeoff, those engines are turning at over 27,000 r.p.m. This creates an enormous ""gyroscopic"" force effect. When the aircraft lost its vertical stabiliser and rudder, natural twisting of the airframe would occur, causing those gyroscopic forces in the engines to be translated into enormous shear force easily capable of shearing the engine off. Those engines are designed to shear off under excess stress. Once losing that first engine, the airframe would twist even more violently, increasing those shearing forces in the other engine causing it to also shear off rather quickly.      I hope everyone posting here will spare some sympathy for the innocent civilians of Afghanistan who have been killed in recent weeks.      Yet again our city is stricken. I can't help but be reminded of Egyptair flight 990 in 1999. Could that crash be related to September 11? Why was an official report never filed? Why did the FBI never investigate that crash? It seems in light of all these tragedies, there are more questions than answers.      What a tragedy. My heartfelt condolences to all those people who were on board of American flight 587. Yet a question comes to my mind: isn't it too dangerous to build large airports so close to residential areas?      Another example of the media ruling our lives. How does a relatively small disaster story from America have higher priority than hundreds more being killed in other countries? If this plane crash is such a high profile incident, then why has the Airbus 300 not been grounded for investigations like Concorde was?      August 1998 I was flying from Atlanta to NY. The airports were blocked and closed and we were told it was due to weather. As it was the weekend of the bombings of the Embassy in Africa, it is quite clear they were closed for fear of terrorists. We here think the government has been too quick to deny this ""crash"" was terrorist. Too afraid to lose more money if people are scared. If we are soldiers on the front we need to know the truth.      As a physician, we protect the patient by working to exclude the most threatening illness - ie the burden is to prove it is not a heart attack, not to start out saying it is just muscle pain in the chest. The analysts are not following this model.      The death of so many people from one island in the Caribbean is incredibly sad. Their loss is, proportionately, absolutely enormous, in such a small community where everybody knows everybody. The whole world is falling apart and we're not taking notice.      Having flown back from New York the day before... you try not to be worried by all the crashes, knowing deep down that it's still a statistically safe mode of transport. Would I get on a plane to New York again? I guess I would. But I'd worry about it far more than I used to.      I note that over the weekend 579 people died and 24,000 people were made homeless and destitute by floods in Algeria. Needless to say it was given such a low priority by the news services that nobody knows about it, apart from the 24,000 homeless and destitute people. This attitude helps to explain why the Western world is resented so much.      I am a 15-year-old student attending school in Manhattan. I moved here with my family (4 siblings) from Western Canada on August 1st. My entire life has changed after the events of September 11... hearing the first plane flying over my school, the explosion and living in a city still in grief two months later. This last Monday, at school again, a friend came running in yelling the terrible news of another plane crash in New York. Then a school meeting called...all too familiar. When the news was broken, some students broke down in tears, others scared, but one thing was clear: another test had just landed on our shores.      I am a regular flyer to and from Heathrow/Gatwick. I was amazed when reading your report of the airbus crash that there is a time limit between planes taking off. The last flight I flew the plane before had just taken off and we were hurtling down the runway. A friend of mine was travelling to Sweden one day and just after take off the plane dropped suddenly, apparently caused by turbulence created by the plane in front.      A friend and I were actually on a BA plane positioned just next to the runway ready to take off after two more planes when the two passengers sitting in front of us saw the plane fall to the ground and we observed a huge golden explosion, followed by streams of black smoke. None of the planes took off then and we spent a couple of very claustrophobic hours on board before they'd allow us to 'de-plane' and return to the terminal. Many passengers seemed exasperated by the delays and cancellations that ensued - if they had seen the fireball as we did and imagined the people inside I am sure they would have acted a little differently.      I was in an airplane en route to New York when the crash occurred. Our pilot told us we were being diverted to another city because ""all of the NYC airports had closed"". Needless to say, everyone on the plane knew something terrible had happened, but the passengers and crew were utterly calm. When I arrived home later that day, I once again realized that after everything we have been through during the past few months, nothing can break New York's spirit. My heart goes out to those who were lost, and I remain incredibly proud of our emergency services and the citizens of this great city. Those of you who aren't here should pay us a visit.      I'm a JFK-based flight attendant for American Airlines. I was in the air when I heard the news, having laid over in Santo Domingo just the day before. Our crew heard about the accident via an aircraft reporting system, but since details were vague, our Captain elected not to tell the passengers. Knowing that I likely lost friends on the flight, as well as passengers I've come to know over 12 years, it was extremely difficult to put on a ""happy face"" and tend to our passengers who knew nothing of the disaster. Somehow, we managed... I lost two dear friends on this flight, and am worried about another flight attendant friend of mine who lives 8 blocks from the accident in Rockaway Park. It's truly unbelievable that this has happened in the aftermath of the horrendous terrorist attacks.      A substantial part flight 587 hit the rear of my neighbor's house setting it ablaze. Just 80 ft from my bedroom were I was just getting ready for work. With the rest of the plane falling just blocks away. I ran out to see if I could help anyone, but by the time I got dress and out the door the NYFD and NYPD were already onsite. With 3-4 Min they were there. I ran back to house, tossed my wife and 2 kids in the mini-van and headed up wind of the smoke, to a relative's house in Belle Harbor. If Flight 587 crashed due to an accident, this is a very strange accident. I want to know how a perfectly normal aircraft falls to pieces in mid-air. If, as reports say, it's a catastrophic mechanical failure, why aren't all A300 being grounded?      I live on the same block. When the plane went down, I just couldn't believe my eyes - another tragedy! I tried calling 911, but all the phones were down. I hope and pray that my neighbours who are missing are still alive.      Yesterday morning, as on September 11th, I awoke to the sound of the radio, hearing the exact same words - ""do we know if it was an accident or an attack"". Finding out what actually happened did little to dispel the fear that is always in the back of my mind, what's next? We are being asked by the fates to shoulder an extraordinary load. One hopes that the old adage, about it always being darkest before dawn, holds true for New York.      New York has suffered enough. I was almost killed in the World Trade Center disaster. Now one of my friends has been killed today in this disaster.      I was driving to work this morning and the next thing I see is a plane going down. It looked like a bomb exploded on the plane.      Another tragedy has touched our lives, this time personally for me. My stepmother was on the plane. My sixteen-year-old half-sister is at home in California and our Dad is here in the UK - he is flying out tomorrow. This horror has reached beyond New York again. When will it all end?      I was in New York only last weekend to run the marathon. Thank you NYC for making it the best weekend of my life. You don't deserve this. My heart goes out to all of those people both in Queens and in the Dominican Republic. I read today about the brave fire fighters who rushed to the scene despite being off duty, collecting their apparatus on the way. Be proud of the FDNY.      We were driving home from Long Island and suddenly we say thick, black smoke on the opposite side of the bay. We knew something was up but it was not until a few minutes later that we heard on the radio that there had been a plane crash. We managed to get across the first bridge to Staten Island before they closed all the bridges. It was an eerie experience - and hard to explain to my 9 year old whom I am bringing to the UK to visit in December. We will still come but I will be saying a silent prayer throughout the flight.      Why NY, again? No answers, again. London has always felt a bond with NYC and the USA. This time, our heartfelt condolences also go out to the Dominican Republic as well as anyone else affected by this tragedy, which could so easily have happened anywhere.      I was sitting in my office, 20 minutes away from heading to Heathrow to catch a flight to JFK when the incident happened. I had to think twice before going, but I did, and the plane was only delayed by two hours. I'm here in NYC and feel perfectly safe - sometimes it's important, although difficult, to think rationally about these things.      Entering a colleague's office yesterday, she greeted me with the news that there had been another plane crash in New York. For once I refused to read, listen or watch the news in the hope that it would all go away if I didn't. It hasn't.      I'm not really sure about what happened this morning but I had just gotten to work early and was making coffee when I saw the plane come down. I wasn't able to take in what was happening at the time as I was so shocked. One of my uncles was killed on September 11. But when what I had just witnessed sank in I looked out the window to see the plumes of smoke billowing from the ground. Instantly I called 911 but the phone was down. I'm not sure what to make of the situation, if it was a terrorist attack or not. But my heart goes out to those affected by this tragedy. The people of New York have been through a lot recently.      Today is a public holiday for most in NY. Travelling on the near empty subway this morning from Manhattan to Brooklyn, I envied the majority of New Yorkers at home resting after two months of tension and fear. Funerals, bomb scares and constant hard luck stories in the media have left everyone empty and weary. Every piece of junk mail is examined and shaken for Anthrax. Now I think of the innocent people resting in those homes who were killed by the crashing plane as well as the passengers who were leaving for a well-deserved break. Is there anywhere we can go without being afraid? When is this going to end?      Shortly after 11:30 my Professor held a moment of silence in our class. It is Veteran's Day in the United States but he was thinking about a student that is no longer with us because of September 11. Only a few minutes prior I learnt of a plane that had crashed into a residential area of Queens, NY and I was thinking of, and now praying for, someone too. The one thing I can do is cry. That is what makes me human and I refuse to lose that.      This is truly a tragedy in a time where the city of New York has been through a lot. Of any city, New York has the spirit and the will to endure such tragic events.      I'm working now in my office building on the upper west side of Manhattan. Most of my co-workers are either listening to the radio or are on-line trying to get the latest on the crash. Three of our employees have left for their homes in Rockaway where their children are home today on account of it being a national holiday. We hope and pray that they are safe.      I had just left a conference in London tonight and saw the headline on the London Evening Standard - to see such a thing again is so very sad and depressing. To those in the US I can only say that when these things happen we do feel them over here as badly. The mood at London Victoria station tonight was again subdued. For what it's worth we do feel very close to you all in New York and very conscious that London is also a risky place in which to live and work. With warm wishes and condolences from London.      I want to express my great sympathy to the Americans and to the citizens of New York especially. It seems as if America has to bear all the pain that the world can offer. I want to share it with you. My condolences to the persons who lost their loved ones.      I might be incredibly ignorant but, after the Concorde disaster all Concorde planes were grounded. Is this going to happen to the Airbus 300? Is seems to be a major design flaw if the tail fin can shear off, then the engines fall off. Surely they should all be grounded and have to gain air safety certificates before they can fly again. It seems incredible that this has not happened.      We as Americans will forever be more aware of this type of unfortunate accident since September 11. As a person that travels frequently to the Dominican Republic my condolences to the families that lost love ones in the American accident.      It's sad that such a terrible incident happened again. I pray for the victims of this accident. We will prevail through all of this.      I was at work when we heard what happened. Our instant reaction was ""not again"" as was that of most people. We pray that this was a tragic accident and our thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost loved ones and to NY and America as a whole.      My heart sank when I heard the news today. No words can express the pain and sorrow I feel for every America and especially every New Yorker. I wish I could take all your hurt away, may God bless you all.      Will the authorities now immediately ground all Airbus A-300s as they did when Concorde crashed last year?      You have to wonder how many people will be afraid of travelling again now this has happened. I am a frequent traveller and plan to postpone as many trips as possible for the foreseeable future.      Another test. We'll get through this one too. We hope that it's just an unfortunate accident and not another terrorist strike. Since September 11, we're prepared for anything. Until we know what caused the crash, we'll continue to be strong and resolute. Condolences to all those affected.      What has happened is absolutely terrible. How this has happened is unbelievable. I hope this will end very soon.      I truly hope this is an accident and my sympathies go out to all the families that have lost loved ones. I will live in New York forever because it is the best place in the world.      When the first reports were received, I could sense a fear, a worry that both the city and people of NYC have again been the victims of a cruel twist of fate. Although all TV and radio here has switched over into the recently well-rehearsed 'tragedy' mode, there is a certain resilience, registering as only a blip on the emotional radar, that is being demonstrated right now. That we have become so used to horrors like this surely is a bad thing. There is no lengthy talk on the streets about the cause and effect.      I work for an international financial organisation as their Head of Human Resources and as one can gather the sadness of the tragedy on the 11th September was accompanied soon after by layoffs, redundancy etc which caused even more hardship to hundreds of families. I was having a late afternoon snooze when I was woken up by the VP of one of our business units who informed me of the latest AA crash. My feelings was first one of anger and disgust then ones of sadness (when we were told it was an accident) and finally frustration as I felt helpless in fighting destiny. For the New Yorkers, Dominicans and for those loved ones left behind I cannot express in words what they must be going through.     There is no rush to blame. There is no rush to be with loved ones. There is almost a resigned attitude that, as Mayor Giuliani has said, ""we are being tested again and we will pass this test again"" but at what cost? As someone who permanently relocated to NYC only a few months ago after living in the UK all my life, to embrace a culture and work ethic so different from the UK, I am now having more than second thoughts. Should so much really happen to such a town?      The skyline of America has changed. But not the resolve which makes up a global power. Through all this insanity and tragedy there will be some voice of reason. And everything will change after this. This morning again America is not the same. My thoughts, and tears, are with the souls lost in this incredible tragedy      Not again, surely not again, were my thoughts as soon as I heard the news from the doorman, in the lobby of my Times Square offices. I became nervous and my hands began to perspire. The butterflies that used to flutter in my stomach every time I heard a siren in Manhattan for about a month after the first attacks here have now returned. My relief that this is likely just an accident and not a terrorist activity, is overshadowed by my sorrow for the loss of the families of yet more victims in New York.      Oh no, not again is the sentiment echoing around here. I wish it was an accident, but my gut feeling suggests otherwise.      I'm up in the largely Dominican neighbourhood of Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan, and everyone is tuned to Spanish radio stations. There is a certain emptiness and palpable fear on the streets. People are crowding in the bodegas and restaurants looking silently at the television screens.      This is just too much for one country to handle. Our hearts go out again to our fellow Americans in NY in their grief. We will never be the same.      New Yorkers, you are inspiring to watch. I see on TV many men volunteering and helping the firemen with the hoses and equipment. Thank you for reminding the nation of the American spirit of helping wherever needed.      A friend of mine that lives in northern New Jersey, near New York, ran off on September 11 to assist with the recovery effort. She phoned me this morning to say: ""If I'm not home tonight, you know why. They need my help again."" Even in the face of repeated tragedies, humans feel the need to help their fellow man.      I work in a hotel directly beside the United Nations where many world leaders are currently meeting for the General Assembly. Already on high alert, part of the UN was has been placed under lockdown and they have closed off the street to the public until further notice. Bomb sniffing dogs and metal detectors are being used to check every person that enters the area. We are all in a state of shock and there's heightened anxiety in lieu of what happened just two months ago.      This must be heartrending for New Yorkers and relatives of the victims in the plane and on the ground. If it helps at all the American Airlines spokesman just said this plane was on a routine maintenance ""A"" overhaul yesterday so I think it seems most likely a maintenance error rather than something worse. God bless you all over there.      I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic and currently reside in NYC. I was in complete shock upon hearing the news and my heart goes out to all the victims and their family members, the Dominican Republic and NYC. These past few months have been extremely difficult for us, and all of these tragedies have led many of us to wonder whether we'll come home after work.. You never know what to expect.      I want express my deepest sympathy to families who might have lost someone in this horrific plane crash. The city of New York has been witnessing sad moments ever since the attack on the World Trade Center. We hope not to hear of any more plane crashes.      Even in the remote mountains of Pennsylvania we are affected. My patients are frightened, anxious and depressed.      Before September 11, this would have been a horrific accident. Now all we can think is ""Oh God, please not again"". My thoughts and prayers are with the already grieving city.      My condolences to the American people, especially in the New York area.      Just when we had swallowed what happened on September 11, another tragedy befalls upon NYC to make us feel the way we did that awful day. No words can express my deepest condolences for the families of all the victims.      Yet more people have lost their lives due to an aircraft incident. All our prayers are with those who are still waiting to hear news of lost loved ones and those who have been lost. New York has suffered greatly over the past few months and this will not help at all.      Let's hope it's not another horrific attack, the city of NY has already been through enough tragedy. Our thoughts are once again with all concerned.      I was in Battery Park two months ago and witnessed with my own eyes the horrors of the World Trade disaster. My heart and prayers go out to everyone back home. May this awful event not be caused by an act of terror.      In times such as this, words may mean very little to families of the victims. I hope thoughts and prayers of millions of people worldwide can make them feeling better.      I'm sitting here on the 29th floor of my office building, which overlooks the East River. To my right I can see where the World Trade Center used to be. To my left, I can see what remains of the billowing smoke of flight 587. Although the mood is subdued, for the most part, people are continuing with their daily routines.      It's a tragic day when we all hold our breath hoping that this latest incident is an accident and not another act of terrorism. My thoughts and best wishes to everyone affected by this.      There haven't been too many first hand reports of commuting problems as most people had already arrived at work. No one is discussing the attacks of 11 September nor are there any speculations that today's crash is somehow related to the terrorist attacks. People are discussing airline safety in general with particular emphasis on JFK airport which has had a series of tragedies in recent years. People are hoping for survivors, but expecting the worst.      I'm on the 16th floor of a skyscraper looking out onto 3rd Avenue and 55th street. There's very little traffic for this time of day. All the bridges and tunnels have been closed down for now. Everyone is nervous and jumping at loud noises. We're all hoping it's just a terrible accident and not another terrorist attack.      I just heard the terrible news. Yet more tests for the people of America. Be brave, our hearts go out to you.      My condolences go out to the families and friends who lost their loved ones both on September 11 and today. I think it is another one of the tests by God, for our own doings. Time to think and time to reflect, I should say.      Regardless of how this disaster occurred, it is one more tragedy that New York will live with. It is easy to feel useless from afar. All we can do is hope for survivors.      Our thoughts must be with the families and friends of those who lost their lives and with the already hard-pressed NY Emergency Services. I hope and pray that this was not a terrorist act.      I was at a meeting on Monday in a restaurant, when the news came of the plane crash. I have never felt such an emptiness inside, I cannot imagine what those poor people went through in the last moments before the crash. I really hope there is a life after death and that they are at peace. My deepest sympathy to all the relatives and family members. God bless you.       The past few months in New York have been so very hard on all of us. Each and every person who lives here has been tested. The time has come for some relaxation, some peace. We all keep hoping for this time, whether silently or aloud, and we all keep wondering when we may feel it. My love and sorrow goes out endlessly to all who have lost loved ones. "
HOC HOC-DF -0.16 " We let atrocities carry on in the Balkans and were so slow to react. Once again we are letting these people down. We only seem to act when we have a financial gain. Being in charge of the world carries a moral responsibility which we fail to meet.      Without trying to undermine the number of victims in the terrorist attacks in USA on 11th of Sep. Please do remember that during the conflict in Kosovo at least tenfold of that number of people have died. Now, if you can put that in perspective with the population of Kosovo (2 million). Now, it is clear the scale of a terrorist atrocities committed by Milosevic, Kradjic, Mladic, et al and their numerous and still free roaming thugs.      The so-called Hague trial against Milosevic is a mockery of justice. It is victors' justice. There is no such thing as ""world court"". More over, Milosevic was a head of state with all the immunity intact. Let me ask fair questions: Why only Milosevic? How about the US ex-presidents for their crime in Vietnam?      Of course the Balkans have been forgotten. The interventions of the western powers in this region have for centuries been exclusively focused on their own long and short term strategic military and economic interests.      Krajina will never be forgotten by the Serbs who were born there, and who were ethnically cleansed by Croats assisted by NATO air raids. The Serbs who had lived there for centuries are still not permitted to return - until such time, we should not allow anyone else to forget about Krajina either.      The terrorism attacks in the States one more prove how wrong were the decisions of allying with terrorists in the Balkans, by the Clinton administration.      This totally depends on the point of view. Mostly the western world leaders have forgotten the Balkan criminals, no doubt about it. But there are the people whose mission is to capture these villains, and I am sure they have not forgotten their primary objective. The International Court doesn't have any interest at the moment towards the Muslim terrorists, but mostly at the Balkan people. I would see that the criminal investigations around the world are only somewhat affected by the new developments.      Sad but true: Out of sight, out of mind. The media focuses too much on headlines and is not informative enough on all global topics. After September 11 the media has only focused on one cause.      In the wake of the tragic events of September 11 the best course of action for the West would be to re-examine its policy towards the Albanian ""freedom fighters"". Some time ago Osama Bin Laden also used to be a ""freedom fighter"", but today he is the West's enemy .     If Milosevic is in a ""world court"" for war crimes, why don't we see Kissinger, Reagan and Bush Sr there too? Whatever Milosevic may have committed, it certainly is at a child's level compared to the ruthlessness committed around the world by the above mentioned.      Nato leaders and Tony Blair in particular have recently used NATO's war against Yugoslavia as an example of how waging war on recalcitrant regimes governing rogue countries produces desired results in bringing democracy and freedom to oppressed people. However, while it is true that a more democratic government is in power in Belgrade and Milosevic is in prison the funds for rebuilding Yugoslavia's shattered economy which were originally promised to the people of Yugoslavia as a dividend for rising up against Milosevic's regime have largely been forgotten.      The everyday lot of ordinary people has become worse over the past year and their situation is likely to get even harder over the coming year as economic restructuring kicks in. If the Western governments fail to provide proper support for the Yugoslav economy then the current transitional government will fail and the people of Yugoslavia will be left desperate and without hope once again. The more the West is preoccupied with other issues the more it seems likely that Yugoslavia will fail and may drag the Balkans down with it. When this happens will Mr Blair still consider the war against Yugoslavia a success?      Forgot? The world never did wake up to the Balkans war and this is why it went on for so long, and why the likes of Milosevic were able to carry out ethnic cleansing on a mass scale. He got away with it then and he'll get away lightly now which is why he can ridicule the trial.      The Balkans have been forgotten because Serbia/new F.R. of Yugoslavia is finally now our ally. But don't worry: it won't be long before another ""freedom fighter"" group demands and starts fighting for greater autonomy. Plus, the so-called democratic election in Kosovo is approaching; Montenegro may opt out for independence, and Macedonia's new constitutional order will surely fail after a couple of months. It's certain that journalists focusing on the region won't be out a job yet!      In February one of the most evil men on earth is being put on trial in front of a world court and jury to face his crimes against humanity. We have not forgotten what he has done. In fact with each passing day we learn more about his horrific deeds. If it seems we have become complacent about current events in the Balkans it is because the media has turned its attention to yet another evil that threatens the morality of the human race. Fortunately mankind does not forget these horrors. These are the same evils we fought against in WWII. We can never forget that it is among us. Always has been and always will be. But we can never turn our backs to it. The Trial goes on and so does our struggle of good against evil.       No one who has experienced Nato's 78-day terror-bombing of Yugoslavia will ever forget it. To speak about ""media freedom"" for years and then pulverise the RT Serbia TV station in Belgrade and then claim it as an OK operation, as Tony Blair has done, is something I remember every time I turn on the Natomedia (CNN, BBC, ZDF, SKY, etc) "
HOC HOC-EK -0.16 " The increasing level of media hype and speculation is unhelpful. Articles such as the Daily Mail ""All you need to know about Germ Warfare"" type of article only serve to cause nervousness among the wider population. It is definitely time for more of a grown-up approach to reporting and less of the level that can only be aimed at increased circulation. I, for one, would welcome a return to intelligent reporting in a way that informs on the background and the progress without frightening the population or jeopardising the safety of the armed forces.      I am growing tired of the endless sensationalism that pervades media coverage (except the BBC). Morning headlines turn me away from reading the newspaper coverage: zero journalistic ability or integrity. What I want to know is: what is the evidence against bin Laden? What about other terrorist groups, both here and abroad? What military steps are actually being taken? Whose troops are involved and how many? Forecasts of war do not help, they just cause panic and fear (terrorism in all but name). We can make up our own minds, thank you. Just give us the facts!      Muslims are peaceful people but the media is making them out to be monsters. Do they think the public is really so stupid?      Careless talk does indeed cost lives, but there is such a thing as disinformation. Just before land operations in Gulf War, all the armchair pundits were talking about an amphibious assault on Kuwait. CNN - which Saddam watches - even broadcast footage of marines practicing landing manoeuvres. But the eventual attack came from inland, sweeping behind the city from the Saudi border. Let's hope a similar surprise is planned for the terrorists - and that the media are being used to wrong-foot them or keep them guessing.      My fianc? had only been out in the Middle East on military exercises for 24 hours, when the news broke of the WTC bombings. I immediately felt sick with worry because ""another Gulf War"" was resounding throughout every news station. News stations were showing pictures of British Paratroopers leaving Dover, and Navy Ships heading for the Middle East. The Saif Sareea exercise was named, as was it's objective and exact location. Whilst some stations got their facts right and correctly stated that the military personnel pictured were leaving to take part in the exercise, others implied the forces were leaving to go to war as American allies! Thanks to speculating and sensationalising, I have lost a stone in weight and not slept for two weeks.      Eventually I had to make it my mission to avoid reading or watching any news in order to keep my sanity. My thoughts are with the victims of other conflicts and families from the rest of the world who have suffered as a result of terrorism and war over the last 50 years. I can only wish that the sheer magnitude in loss of lives was portrayed as comprehensively for every tragedy.      Since 11th of September I have seen nothing but propaganda material, which has only made it more obvious that perhaps what we hear is not always what is true. After researching some of the stories that I have heard since America was terrorised I was surprised and disturbed to find that some of them are inaccurate and exaggerated. The news today is fuelling hate. Hate not for those who caused the WTC to collapse, but for people that are our neighbours, friends and colleagues. The Media has been immature and irresponsible of late, and it is very sad.      There is definitely too much speculation - the key word being speculation - by the media. People are being frightened by this speculation. We are frightened enough by the facts without the media adding to it.      We should remember just what we are fighting for: basic democratic rights, which include the right to freely discuss and speculate, whether down the pub or in print. Speculation does not do much to cause fear, as has been claimed, but secrecy and state control of the press, restricting what they can publish, will both breed fear and give the terrorists a victory of having destroyed some of our basic rights. Obviously actual operational information and opinions from military sources who were or are in position to really know what may be done in detail should be considered confidential, but speculation and comment in the papers and from completely uninvolved ex-servicemen should be free.      Using Schedule D on this is paranoid and indicative of the nanny state we live in. I want to know what's going on as an informed citizen (sorry - subject) of this country. Fine - I'll read US news and watch CNN.      Yes there is too much speculation, most of it coming from these forums! We are two weeks after the disaster and, let's face it, not much has happened. Yet these discussions are still almost exclusively devoted to navel-gazing about terrorism. Can I enter a plea for more varied topics?      I think the way the media has reported the entire disaster has been so irresponsible that there should be a public enquiry. The amount of coverage that has been given in the daily newspapers and on the national television news is so over the top. The majority (as is the way with the media) of the news printed and reported is hearsay. The only purpose I can see the reporting serving is stirring up bad feeling in the western world against Afghanistan, a country that has nothing to do with it given the evidence in front of us.      It seems to me that with the way the media are continuing to cover the terrorist attack in the USA, they would consider it juicy news if the world did go to war. This appetite they seem to have for death and destruction really disturbs me. I don't think it's right that the media are allowed to divulge the whereabouts and actions of the SAS, of all people. After all, isn't it the idea that they are the ""secret"" service?      As always of course there is too much media speculation. I hate the media. What a field day you had with the world trade centre. The papers are just as bad if not worse. How could they publish still photos of people jumping out of the windows? Yes it is major news, but did I really have to watch the planes crashing into the centre from thousands of different angles every two minutes? Did I have to watch the slow motion replays? It disgusted me that one reporter sounded positively excited as the first tower collapsed. What about the rest of the news in the world? Or wasn't there any?      I am appalled at the amount of over-coverage of these latest events. It is a hysteria created by the media, whipping everyone into a frenzy of fear and antagonism against the chosen target. By this hideous obsessing over the event and speculating over possible retaliation, the media are giving the perpetrators of this unspeakable act continued satisfaction in seeing us all drawn in to a whirlwind of fear and confusion. And for heaven's sake, why are you all going overboard about bio-warfare? How can you possibly justify whole articles about this? It achieves nothing but fear and hatred in the hearts of ordinary people.      Speculation by the media is pointless, everyone is doing that already in the offices and pubs throughout the land. What we need is hard facts. The main starting block for any discussion has to be: where is the enemy and how can we hit him without getting badly mauled ourselves? The media are just trying to talk up a good story, most people know that this ""war"" will be conducted in the boardrooms and conference venues as we slowly choke off supplies, safe harbours and funding to these organisations.      Is there too much speculation about military action in the media? No, there is not. It is to be expected that the media reel out conjecture after conjecture in an attempt to fill airwaves. What news programs should do is report news, i.e. new things, not feel obligated to broadcast hot air and hypothesis when they have no facts. CNN has a huge responsibility to carry. If it was not for their blanket coverage of every nuance of the Gulf war & the video footage of the surgical strikes hitting targets neither Sky nor BBC would feel obliged to keep on air the tepid 24-hour news channels they both produce. When commentators look back on the journalistic impact of BBC News 24 I seriously doubt they will be able to find anything complimentary to say about it apart from it stopping fatuous game shows and reality TV programmes.      Having observed the news coverage of the last few weeks, it is evident that the media are cranking up the tension and building on our fears of a war. There has got to be end to this constant war-mongering that is in the gutter press and on some radio stations. It comes to something when you can look at potential Afghan targets on a BBC website. Do you not think that the terrorists have access to the internet? Whatever happened to the element of surprise?      I live near a large military base and the departure of troops for extended exercises is part of the usual routine. Waving goodbye to a family member is heart-wrenching enough without the media taking the opportunity to use the ""going to war"" angle when in fact, it simply isn't true. Right now, I do believe the way the media is representing typical military deployments is adding to the anguish families and children are feeling and they need to stop this right now.      Though we are all obsessed with news, there is a growing unhealthy interest, and in some cases addiction, to comment on the news. There is a very definite distinction between news and comment. News is fact (usually), comment is someone's interpretation or opinion on that news. The whole US crisis would be a lot less sensationalist and alarmist if the media concentrated on news reporting and cut the comment.      The US coverage has been fair. I do not think people around the world understand the extent of the damage in New York. The US media had more than reasonable grounds to become anti-Arab, but they have gone out of their way to not to be. If London's financial district had been destroyed in the same manner, what would the BBC be saying?      Since the media are raising so many speculations, how come no one raised the issue of the Black Boxes found in the three planes? Maybe evidence is there that can unravel the mystery. Maybe the media does not want to find the truth. It's better money speculating! Well as many others I have found BBC to be the closest source to the Truth and CNN the furthest. I am glad that someone from the West still cares to spread truth rather than publish sellable rumours, AKA Trash!      I am grateful for the news coverage around the world, especially the first 48 - 72 hours after the terrorist attacks on America. Since then, real newsworthy events have not kept pace with the appetite for action or simply the need to know. The news industry has a lot of time to fill and columns to publish, thus every ex-official gets his shot at counselling the present governments on what should be done and how to do it. The fact of the matter is all these ex-officials posing as experts simply have no clue, and we should stick to reporting real news.      Given the advanced knowledge of planning and current involvement of special forces reported by the media, we should all hope that terrorists can't read.      The British tabloid media has plumbed new depths in its inane and crass coverage of the military build up. The Daily Express leads the way with its ""Take Him Out"" headlines and superimposing gun sights on bin Laden. While I have no particular qualms about the targeting of bin Laden and his ilk, surely we should have a more educated analysis of the situation rather than endless stories about how ""our boys"" in the SAS are going to take out bin Laden. Even respected media organisations like the BBC have been crass in their coverage, particularly the biased and inflammatory Question Time programme, just days after the tragic event. The media's irresistible urge to gain information has led to questionable analysis and standards throughout the crisis.      Let's not forget that the media are there to make money. If facts need to be stretched to sell to the public, then that's what will happen. Do we really need the media to instigate panic? Tell us what we need to know - not what the media thinks!      Journalists have to fill column inches don't they? The real problem is the public who pay for it and believe what they read.      Journalists have always speculated about any subject that they decide to report on, using any angle that they deem appropriate. What is the statement they use, ""never let the facts get in the way of a good story""?      I would like to see more facts instead of channels trying to fill up the news with waffle and obvious rumour-mongering.      The US media is treating this as a circus (not unusual). This is not the end of the world, simply the beginning of a long low-grade war employing many means of assault: financial, diplomatic, the law, and, yes, some force. How long can the speculation last and why is it focused on swift action? The effectiveness of force improves as the timing of the strikes becomes a surprise.      Reports and speculation on military action in the media can kill our soldiers. To the extent that information can help the enemy, the media should impose strict self-restraint in its reporting.      I for one appreciate all of the news that I am given in the United States. That is part of the freedom which causes so much hate of our country around the world, it is obvious here on this forum. I for one am glad to show the world the evil which has been done to my beloved country, and proud of our response to aid those in need there, and hope that no one ever forgets, because once you become comfortable in your lifestyle, this could happen at your home! The unbelievable evil has in NY alone killed over 6,500 people. I can't understand how a civilized person can say that the news has overdone it. I Love the USA, and wait for the justice that is coming, and applaud it.      The enemy didn't know of the existence of Bletchley Park until after WW2. Talk of action to come should be kept on a need to know basis not broadcast to the whole world. When we have lost thousands more young lives I hope the politicians will be proud of their strong brave words. America couldn't win in Vietnam yet now they plan to whip fanatics and terrorists. Fat Chance!      I'd reached a point early on in the media coverage where I had to start limiting my intake of the story: I'd reached sensory overload. The current news load seems to be buoyed only on second-guessing and speculation right now. There have been few new developments but news directors have to find something to put on the air to fill time and make themselves look good. It's been evident since the beginning of this crisis they'll report anything, as long as it's shocking and tends to lend a ""new angle"". Unfortunately, that's how many of the unsubstantiated rumours have been circulated - all in the name of ""good journalism"".      I think that the media is adding to the public's worry about events in America and the Gulf. Whilst not wishing to be seen as unsympathetic, we do now need to move on and get back to some sort of normality. The media can aid this by cutting down the amount of coverage that they give these events. Any developments will be communicated by the media, but hopefully not in such a sensationalistic way.      Today, society seems to be obsessed with reality TV: ""Big Brother"", ""Survivor"", ""The Amazing Race"". But ""Attack on America"" is just the ultimate, isn't it? We all sat and watched America's ABC Vs. CNN on who interviewed who, who had which expert observation, who had the best handycam footage and which looked best in slow-motion. With the initial breaking news, and a rising death tally we all had enough bitter memories to last a lifetime. The need to interview every resident of NY just seemed like overkill. I understand the need to be up-to-date with world events, I understand the need for retribution, but is the morbid fascination with death and destruction really the road that we, the people of the world should be walking down?      Speculation has its place in opinion columns, but journalism ought to keep to what is truly known and what is truly happening. Confusion and the types of dread that it causes, arising from multiple conflicting versions of any scenario, can serve as a weapon that terrorism knows well and uses effectively. Terrorism likes best to cause widespread confusion and fear among its targeted group. It also thrives on paranoid silence, which results from the opposite of open and honest communication. There is a careful balance in between, where we are able to strive to live, and in many ways journalism ought, at its best, to achieve a kind of leadership in that regard. The BBC does better than most.      The coverage provided by the major networks was initially informative, but as time has progressed has become nothing more than a ratings competition. The networks are comparing who can get the most ""eyewitness"" and so-called ""terrorism expert"" interviewees who really give us nothing more than their opinion with the interviewers asking questions that really don't need to be asked.      I have noticed over the last couple of days that the 'fight against terrorism' is now a 'fight against international terrorism'. Does this mean that a country's fight with terrorists within its own boundary is outside the present remit?      Media editors are very adept at making speculation look like information. You probably never believed much of what you read in newspapers before - and this is certainly not a good time to start! I'm in favour of the public's need for information being sated - so long as the information supplied is reasonably accurate, and does not compromise the safety of our people out there in the firing line.      I used to be pro-USA, pro-Israel and pro-anything Western World, until I came and lived in Saudi Arabia. The news coverage of the events in the US has turned me 180 degrees. Is there one news service out there that will stop the sensationalist rubbish and ask the tough questions? It does not require much intelligence to see that there is more to this than what the world is so obviously meant to think. The real losers are the Arabs and Islam. I still need to know why not one security service in the world got even a whisper of what was about to happen? I now read the local newspapers and enjoy the balance and absence of sensationalism.      I would like to express my dislike of US media coverage. That's why the BBC is like a breath of fresh air to me. I am tired of the US media forcing their opinion on the people. I am also deeply hurt by some of the comments on this topic. For some of the people stating that we should not fight fire with fire, and that no more lives need to be taken, I suggest we build a new tower, then put you in it, while doing nothing to prevent terrorism.      The media - especially broadcast media - is not doing a good job at covering this story. They focus on a minority of radical fundamentalists, with tight shots and give them undue weight, making everyone believe the opposition is so strong. When are these ""journalists"" going to do some real legwork and give a truly balanced view of the situation?      The media should report only the facts as known and stop encouraging the 'Armchair Warrior"" syndrome.      I'm unsure what media coverage everyone else has been watching, but I have been very pleased with what I'm seeing. There has been a clear effort on the media's part to make a distinction between the terrorists and Arabs or Muslims. In every prayer service I have seen on television many religious leaders spoke from different religious backgrounds. I've even gained a lot more understanding of the plight of the Afghan people. If anything, the media coverage has exposed how complicated an issue this is, and how a typical war will not solve anything. I think those who accuse the media of fanning pro-war and anti-Arab sentiment are just looking for it.      The media coverage in the US I'm sorry to say has been despicable. The coverage has given no regard to the millions of Americans of Arab and Muslim decent who watch their programs. Much of the backlash against Muslims in the states is due to the media's coverage over here. A terrorist is a terrorist no matter what perverted beliefs he or she follows, even though their barbaric beliefs go against Islamic teachings. And yet they were still referred to as ""Muslim terrorists"", therefore implying that they are acting in accordance with Islam.      The media was quick to show the faces of some of the suspects who allegedly died in these horrific, unjustified attacks who turned out to be alive in some other countries, yet didn't do nearly as much to retract those stories which turned out to be false. They were also quick to show a few Arab children jumping up and down, yet didn't mention the 5 Israeli men who were arrested cheering and rejoicing the day of the tragedy.      Even America Online, which has plenty of Arab and Muslim subscribers, has shut down its Arabic chat rooms. If that isn't discriminatory, I don't know what is. This shows journalism and the media at its worst. Many thanks and congratulations to the BBC on providing some of the most balanced and unbiased coverage I have come ever come across. My heart goes out to all the victims and their families that were affected by this travesty. We will rebuild, and overcome. And no matter whom the evil culprits of these attacks were, we will get you. God Bless the USA.      I don't expect the UK and the US governments to reveal specific military plans. What is important - and there is no speculation about that - is the strong international support for divisive measures against Afghanistan and bin Laden which are building up.      There's no grand conspiracy of warmongering, it's just that the networks which are lacking sufficient knowledge about military matters and have too little to say before the shooting starts, wind up spewing endless rhetoric and filler, most of it misleading or incorrect in some capacity. If they stuck to the ""facts"" more and ended the endless speculation, I'd be grateful.      I have seen surprisingly little speculation about possible military action. All we are told is what hardware is available for use in any action, where standing naval forces are located, what airfields would be available - all of which we know already. Apart from that we have been shown little more than pictures of aircraft and maps of Southern Central Asia. The only meaningful speculation at this time is that by the people likely to find themselves at the receiving end of military action - they know where it hurts, and that is where they expect to be hit.      The use of words adds an important dimension to how this whole thing will unfold. The coalition spokespersons could make improvements in this area. ""Operation Infinite Justice"" was badly chosen ""Crusade"" a no no-no, as was ""wanted dead or alive"". Now we have ""Enduring Freedom"" which is rather depressing as it conjures up images of long queue's at security checks, ID cards, economic downturn etc. Please can we have a bit more thoughtfulness and simplicity: ""Operation stop terror"" sounds good to me.      The media keeps stirring up for war and panic stories. It is now two weeks since the events, and though I was shocked and saddened, I cannot see what good it can do obsessing over it. It's the same kind of media hysteria and hypocrisy which came into being after Diana died.      As a Canadian living relatively close to the border, I have been subjected to the deluge of ""informative"" media from the USA. What I found especially disturbing was the ad for ""America's New War, tommorow at 7"" etc. What have we as a global society come too when we can calmly sit in front of our televisions and watch an ad for something so ridiculous. I have yet to witness one single piece of conclusive evidence directing any amount of blame upon Osama bin Laden. With this blame being placed upon Islamic extremist, they are also labelled as ""evil"" and ""cowards."" I am neither defending nor condemning the actions of whoever is responsible. Yes the tragic events of 11th September are beyond comprehension, yet society needs to maintain an objective perspective, and unfortunately, the man in the Oval Office is the last person to possess this quality.      The immediate coverage was excellent, reflecting what was happening and the general feelings of shock, outrage and sympathy. However, some 62 nations have lost or missing people, including over 200 from the UK, making it the single biggest terrorist act against the UK. Germany is in a similar position. Headlines continue to speak of ""attack ON America"" rather than ""attack IN America"". A simple change of preposition would change both slant and focus.      The media have, I believe, failed the public on this whole issue. Particularly in the tabloid press we have witnessed the type of sensationalist hype that causes people to panic and rush out to the nearest army shop for gas masks. We ought to have more faith in our leaders. They are taking things at a steady pace. Why can't the press? Why do they have this habit of making things look worse than they really are? The answer, I fear, lies in the pockets of the media tycoons.      Comedy was taken off BBC2 on Sunday night because it was viewed as insensitive. It was, however, replaced by the much more palatable John Wayne in the Shootist.      I used to believe that brainwashing only happened in a non-democratic society. After watching American media coverage of 911, TV and newspapers, I now believe it also occurs in a so-called democratic countries.      The media has been manipulated by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, their wild speeches acting as the fuel for cover stories. Real investigative work has not been produced, only what the Governments want us to believe.     The casualties that jumped from the towers should never have been broadcast as it portrayed the most macabre television coverage I have ever witnessed. Secondly the coverage of the financial effects on America, stocks and trading etc was reinforcing mixed messages. What will stick with me is that I felt the USA was grieving for the economy. In short, let's give everyone a medal and resume our financial duty to America.      Inevitably, with so much raw news and actual as-it-happens footage there will be some false moments. But considering what was involved here the media generally have done their very best to bring us, with unparalleled immediacy, the true gist of what has occurred. In New Zealand we live on the very edge of the world but over the last few days we have felt like we were living in New York. That has to be some sort of achievement. We thank Peter Jennings and dozens of others at ABC, CNN and BBC for their brave and insightful coverage of this 21st century nightmare.      The coverage was definitely thorough but absolutely jingoistic in the US. I find it embarrassing and am growing increasingly more sceptical of US major news broadcasts. It's completely obvious that many aren't even investigating, they are being spoon-fed press releases from GW's crew. I haven't seen anyone but foreign presses even question who orchestrated the attacks. They certainly are toning down the US's role in training Osama himself. The ""Let's go to war!"" attitude is pervasive on TV, I haven't heard reporting of any other solutions. And, finally, what I find most disturbing - the ""God bless America"" being crammed down our throats 24-7.      What happened to separation of church and state? According to our own reporters, wasn't the attack partially motivated by religious zeal? Should we counter it with religious zeal too? I find it absurd that I tune in to CNN today and find a Christian prayer service! Not just news of the service, but broadcasting preaching and gospel songs. I love America because of its freedom, its history of accepting EVERY nationality and religion - not just Christians. Let's not forget that our country was founded by groups that were persecuted because of their religions. This is why they wanted it out of government. I want it out of the White House but unless its news, I also want it out of my living room. I make my own time for God, I don't want to go to the CNN chapel. That seems somehow inappropriate. The climate in the US is scary right now and it's largely the American media's fault.      This past decade, a majority of the American media has, for the first time in its history, been controlled by so few people. I believe it's something like 85% of television and radio are owned by five different men such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner. Scary, isn't it? Americans have spent too much time trying to amass personal wealth and possessions that we didn't notice the subtle erosion of our basic rights such as the freedom of press. And now we are stupidly volunteering others away. Wake up, America, before it's too late!      My husband works for a local news affiliate here, I have worked as a newspaper editor. In our experience, common journalists and editors are constantly arguing for better, fairer coverage, their cries unheeded. Management puts pressure on the common workers, advertising sales departments pressure management, legal departments cloud the issues further. I have with my own eyes seen informative, educational and vital stories edited down to nothing more than 30-second sound bites. The bitter truth is the best part of most news stories end up on ""the cutting room floor"", sadly.      I have been extremely disappointed by the media, who immediately pointed the finger at the Middle East, and also still persist in labelling Bin Laden as the prime suspect. The Americans have neither given us evidence or a statement saying that it was definitely Bin Laden, merely he is the prime suspect. What infuriated me even more was the ""expos?"" on BBC World, which after two or three days had solved the whole mystery, interviewed numerous ""experts"" and friends of the accused, and even manage to find ""exclusive"" pictures of the Afghan leader, from a program in 1998. This seems to be a replacement for the JFK mystery that plagued the late 20th century. When will the credits roll?      Speculation about such matters is usually guesswork based on information that is already in the public domain. In most cases the media are simply putting two and two together for those who would not or could not do so on their own. As for news organisations that give cool-headed assessments of the facts without trite emotional fluff, I suggest The Economist (and the BBC, of course).      The media coverage has gone overboard . As usual American interests seems to be world interest. Any contradicting view would not be entertained. Let thinking men and women decide who gains most from these attacks. Definitely not Muslims nor Arabs. My sympathies are for all innocent victims, in Iraq, Iran Palestine Sudan, Afghanistan, America and many others. Victims of American and Israel's policies and the corrupt regimes that serve their interests.      I just love the arrogance of the British press and all the letter writers who urge President Bush to listen carefully to what Tony Blair has to say and not to keep him out of the loop. We all know how experienced Blair is at dealing with terrorists. He hasn't even arrested the Omagh bombers yet!      I cannot believe the media, and the way they have been promoting mass hysteria. Yes, it was a major attack, but they went overboard, and the innocent Muslims all over are paying the price... being spit upon on the streets, and generally mistreated.. they did not deserve this and the media is to blame. Frankly, I think the Islamic community in the US should sue a couple of newspapers over this and the way they reported it.      There has been way too much news coverage attacking every possible angle they could. If this kind of atrocity had happened in a developing country like those in Africa I very much doubt whether we would have been exposed to this degree of coverage.      Premature judgement, ready baked answers to all questions concerning the attack. Early declaration of war against unknown enemy, that's part of what I see in the media coverage of the attack. I can understand politicians rushing to provide the answers, but I expect more from the media, balanced coverage and clear evidence is what the media should follow and not rumours.      Whenever the media has news fall into its lap it over-reacts and saturates us with interminable rehashes of specials, repeats and pundits all going over the same ground time after time. The USA crisis is the latest example. In one session the second plane hitting the twin towers was shown at least 14 time in less than 5 minutes and totally lost it impact and horror. I no longer know what is happening as the overexposure has made me turn way from the news in a search for something more original.      Your coverage is informational, but your historic bias in favour of Arab terrorists compounds their atrocities. BBC has failed to give an accurate picture of anti-American, anti democratic and anti-Jewish hatred in the Arab World. Instead it panders and propagates the propaganda of Palestinian terrorists and hate-filled Arab extremist clerics.      I am afraid that the perpetrators won the media round also, making it strike two for them, by alienating the peaceful silent majority of Muslims who will never see common ground with terrorists. Islamic terrorists. How many times have I heard this sentence in the last week. And why when followers of other religions commit a crime their acts are not pinned to their religions? I think that the media played into the terrorists' hands.      I am an American living temporarily in Austria. I see the comparison between CNN-US edition and CNN-Europe edition. It makes me sick to see American media prey on the victims just to receive good ratings, while it seems European news is much more concerned for people's dignity and privacy. I am ashamed how CNN hunts down victims and publicises their accounts and how we try to make a hero out of everyone. Reporters don't care about people, all they care about is their ratings.      It has seemed since the second plane flew into the WTC that war is inevitable and the chief suspect, Bin Laden. I do not in any way support anyone who uses violence to further their cause, but I do feel that Bin Laden and his supporters have been tried and found guilty by the media and many world leaders, although there has been no trial. Is this justice? The media has a huge responsibility to report the whole picture. I get the impression that there are plenty of people around the world who believe that killing and war do not end killing and war, but perpetuate it. But are we hearing their voices? My impression from the media is that a diplomatic solution is seen as impossible.      All the media are dying for some action, the more dramatic the better. And their reports reflects this - it's as if a sense of restlessness has taken over, everyone poised for action to happen. The purpose? They want to up their circulation or readership. I feel sorry for the people who have to answer the media blokes' quest for action.      It is quite hard to find out what is going on and I was bothered by screams of pure evil! and edition after edition of local papers with horror identikit photos of suspects. I don't need to be stirred, I am already stirred. I will not buy a newspaper again, long live the net. I'll stick with the beeb for its lack of rhetoric and clear un-emotive use of language.       It is not so much the speculation as the tone of the commentary. The word ""war"" is used in excess. An example yesterday was when Tony Blair made a strong speech but also mentioned the innocent oppressed people in Afghanistan. I didn't hear him mention the word war but the newscaster's script predominantly featured warlike overtones and made no mention of the other half of the PM's speech "
HOC HOC-GG -0.17 " Whilst I am against the UN acting as a world policeman, especially in a country out of the UN charter, I think the only logical and ethical course of action is by UN Peacekeeping forces. Admittedly, this is a far from ideal solution, but intolerable crimes against human rights, as well as a maniacal religious insanity, deserve a response that will work. However, I don't think this will happen.      The problem is not the Taleban but rather the greatest anachronism of the last and now present century viz. The UN. The UN is effectively controlled by the USA, France, The UK, Russia and now, also China. This structure was established out of World War II. India, the most populous democracy does not have veto power, nor does Africa. Isn't it interesting that Kofi Anan's appointment had to be sanctioned by the USA? When the World sees The UN as a body which represents all the people of the World, equally, then the actions of the UN will be honoured and respected. But then, UN resolutions will not be biased in favour of the USA and others. Shouldn't the overthrow of legitimate governments by The USA/CIA call for trial and possible imprisonment of the President of The USA?      Have we not learned from the Iraq experience that sanctions do not work the way the UN would like them to work? Honey attracts more flies than oil. Western powers should soften their stance toward the Taleban and engage them in useful, constructive dialogue. As much as America preaches democracy, they should respect non-democratic governments and work with them to show the benefits of a free society and not punish the innocent citizens of the country and force their own beliefs.      On May 23rd 2001 the Taleban authorities in Afghanistan confirmed that all Hindus will be required to wear a strip of yellow cloth sewn onto a shirt pocket in order to identify themselves. They claim that the measure is for their ""protection"". This is a chilling reminder of 1939.      The Taleban's record on respecting other religions gives great cause for concern. Their ultimate aim, upon which they are intent, is ""religious cleansing"". They have already demonstrated their disdain and intolerance for other religions and traditions by the desecration and destruction of the ancient Buddhist statues. We need some other options - how can sanctions work against a regime which appears to thrive on hardship. ""All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"".      How about we focus aid and investment in all of Afghanistans neighbouring countries... and then fund and arm a genuine resistance. The Taleban have no legitimate claim to power and should not be recognised.      The Taleban have generally bought peace and stability to the areas that they control. The western media and politicians portray a lop-sided view of the regime based on a deep-seated prejudice against anything Islamic. After years of war and an endemic gun culture people can at last walk the streets without the fear of crime. The sanctions are without legal or moral foundation and should be scrapped immediately.      Sanctions haven't worked against such regimes anywhere in the world. The common people suffer and are too afraid (rightly so) of doing anything against the regime in power. Other than sanctions, one can either ignore what's happening in the country or attempt a military solution. Personally, I think we should leave Afghanistan to the Afghans. The sort of aid that is directed towards Afghanistan will be much better received in some African countries.      It is somewhat hypocritical, though, that countries like the US make a big deal about human rights abuses in Afghanistan, while completely ignoring human rights abuses in countries like Saudi Arabia. If only Afghanistan had something of value for the US, it would be welcomed with open arms into the global community.      I think the sanctions should be removed, followed by the recognition of the Taleban Government, then engage them in a constructive dialogue. And then a more relaxed way of government could follow. How can girls go to School when there are no buildings or special facilities available for them? All these things require time, money and resources - hardly available under the present scenario. Instead more arms are being funnelled to the opposition to prolong the misery.      I don't understand the selfish attitude of some people, not so long ago these people were considered freedom fighters against the Soviet Union, and now they are portrayed as ""villains"". Why if Iraq is made to pay war compensation to Kuwait, then surely Afghans should be considered for compensation. Instead the opposite is happening.      In a country with over 3 million people on the brink of starvation, the UN was going to spend an enormous amount of money to repair some statues. FEED THE PEOPLE FIRST. And get rid of those sanctions while you are at it.      The Taliban rule through fear and cruelty and I regret to say they would not be in the ascendant if it were not for the short sighted stupidity of the West and Pakistan. Sanctions will only hurt ordinary Afghans. Those who created this mess should now clean it up. Bigots are bullies and they always pick on the defenceless; hence the disgusting treatment meted out to women and minorities in Afghanistan. A halfwit could have seen this one coming...      Here's a novel idea, let them run the country the way they want to. This is a country that is hardened by long drawn-out conflicts so will any type of sanction have an impact on those you want to hurt? Besides, in this consumer driven world what do the Taliban bring to the marketplace to warrant such action? Oh... human rights I hear you say? Hmmm I think that we should look at our own governments first.      The Taliban were effectively raised under a climate of hardship during the Soviet era. So what good are sanctions against people who know how to manage on limited resources? Kofi Annan is on the right track but it is going to be difficult to bring in a group which knows very little else other than war.     I am astonished by some of the pro-Taliban responses here. This regime is the most brutal and repressive in the world at present. There are no excuses for this evil dictatorship. It deserves utmost condemnation and no concessions of any kind.      Isolating the Taliban from the rest of the world will not solve the problem. We should work with them for a better change.      Sanctions are killing our people and they are not working. Instead the super-powers should put pressure on neighbouring countries to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Afghans should be left alone to solve their own problems.      I don't honestly think the Taleban care less what the UN say or do, I'm just surprised they've not made the letters UN illegal yet.      Sanctions have the effect of stifling the economy of a country but the people who end up bearing the pains are the ordinary people. In a place like Afghanistan where the people are oppressed and suppressed by the leadership, we cannot expect a revolt from them regardless of the level of hardship they are forced to face. A gradual process of reform and reconciliation is more likely to succeed and if it doesn't, measures which directly impact on the Taleban leadership, not just the citizens, will have to be considered.      The first thing that that UN and all other countries need to do is to recognize the Taliban Government. It is height of arrogance that the world bodies do not accept the fact that the Tailban are ruling 95% of Afganistan. It is not question of agreeing with or liking the Taliban but of facing the reality. Once ground realities have been understood only then can any good come to Afghanistan.      History has shown numerous times that attempts to deal with fanatics is a total waste of time. Any approaches in this regard are seen as a weakness and are taken advantage of. Unfortunately the only way is to isolate such regimes until an internal uprising provides a solution. What the world must do is ensure the disease does not spread elsewhere.      Sanctions never work, cut the supply of money and the regime will spend what little money it has on weapons to suppress their own people not help them. Funny how military intervention is out of the question, would this be the same if Afghanistan had any resources of value? - then certainly we would see the capitalist nations get stuck in like in Angola and Sierra Leone. Prosperity is the only way forward if this country is to become stable; driving it deeper into the situation which brought about this regime as in many other countries is not the way forward.      Change takes its own course. One must realize that truth. I guess we need to play around a bit with the Taliban. We should sensibly go ahead and help them in every way (monetarily, trade wise) to establish good governance, increase trade. Human mind is such that this would cultivate a feeling of acceptance and respect in their minds which will go a long way in helping them fight their own thinking that ""they are the neglected ones"". Initially it would be a hard task but that's what going to sow the seeds of success. And I pity people who say that ""Afghanistan will be Afghanistan, no one's going to change that!""      I think the UN has now realised that sanctions and one-sided approach is not an answer to all this. Though the Taliban might be wrong in some accounts but not wrong fully as projected. Their authority on Afghanistan should be respected and pushing them to the wall and applying such sanctions neither worked so far and nor it will work in future. The UN should be realistic about the sufferings of the people of Afghanistan.      Constructive engagement methods with the Taliban will only lend credibility to their authority. This is an internal matter for the Afghan people to resolve. Minimizing the full impact might only prolong the duration of the suffering and ensure that more generations of people are subjected to their reign. The worst thing one can do is to supply arms and technology to the Taliban government. Their anti-educational policies will soon ensure that they will be unable to maintain that which they have. Then, if the people living under their rule are fed up, then there will be a more permanent change.      All the problems in Afghanistan with Talibans are only because of USA and UN. After breaking apart Russia now the USA has no interest in Afghanistan. Rather the USA is trying its best to destroy Afghanistan since they know that Afghanistan is the only country that can destroy super power. As far as Talibans are concerned they can be approached with positive attitude and good intention not with the intention of harming them.      I also think that sanctions will not work because Pakistan is supplying all kind of weapons to the Taliban. It is only a tool for the so called international community to use as an excuse of its failure to deal with the problem of the Taliban. The time has come for punishing Pakistan. Why must the Afghan people suffer? It is Pakistan that supports the inhumane forces of the Taliban perhaps with the US consent.      Any plan to resolve the conflict in Afghanistan has to be sensitive to the historical and religious forces at work. However any potential resolution which seeks to encourage rather then bully must surely be a step forward, and perhaps a strategy the UN could employ elsewhere.      Sanctions have never worked effectively. I feel that Kofi Annan is on the right track in attempting to talk to the Taleban. I do not agree with the all that the Taleban say and do, but I feel that convincing them is better than forcing them.      I think the UN should do something to help the people of Afghanistan. Surely the Taleban must realise that going back to the year 0000 does them no favours.      The UN ought to deal with this situation in the same way it dealt with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. There has to be a strategy which allows all citizens of Afghanistan to vote in a fair election. And, like Cambodia, the population must be told that it is safe to vote and they should be given every encouragement to do so. A democratically elected government will then be in place and the state must be left to govern itself and take its own direction.      Sanctions are the only way that the Taleban can be brought to account for what they have done. They have imposed a version of Islam that is anathema to the vast majority of followers of this great religion. They must be punished for their crimes against humanity. The peace negotiations over the last months have come to nothing. The Taleban would lose face if Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stopped supporting them. The UN must continue with all its efforts to bring this regime to see reason and to account for what it has done.      I suppose respecting the sovereignty of another nation may be a radical notion, but perhaps we should let the Afghans have their experiment. I don't see or hear them calling for world domination. Until or unless they do seek to export their brand of theocracy, I say let them be. The people will overthrow them (eventually) if they are not legitimate. And if you're a non-Sunni Muslim, stay away for your own good.      War crimes, crimes against humanity.... mmmmm, why aren't these being applied to the Taleban leadership? Whose decision is it to prosecute or not? - I hope it is not up to the politicians!      A more constructive policy by the UN could easily turn into a more destructive response by the Taleban. Afghanistan is another Israel - no matter how much you try to persuade, coax or force change, you'll be considered a meddler and you'll be ignored. Look at Iraq. Everyone's aware of political enforcement - but Iraq is not interested in listening, because of sanctions. Get real. Nothing will change, Afghanistan will be Afghanistan, no one's going to change that!      It's a tough one to call but a constructive policy must surely be worth a try. There is no suggestion that in the current climate the Taleban will become less extreme or unpredictable.      Passing comments is the easiest thing from the other end of the world. Ask the people of Afghanistan what they had gone through since the Soviet occupation of that country to the multiparty/groups government and the lawlessness of their regime which was the main reason of Taleban coming to power. Sanctions has never worked with any country whether it is N. Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Burma and a whole list of countries in every continent. It has not and will not work on the Taleban.      Sanctions don't work. Governments would rather let their helpless citizens suffer than bow down to external pressure. It would be better to help Afghanis who want to leave get out of the country and Taleban can have who ever wants to stay. They will do as they please anyway. There is no reasoning with people who choose to be irrational.      Everyone should be free to believe what they want, but no group in power should be allowed to force religious laws on the people based on literature of dubious origin. The Taleban would be no match for an international task force dedicated to restoring democracy. Where do I sign up?      Perhaps just allowing them to continue as they are will show the entire world the dangers of what religious insanity can do to a nation. But if there is to be a real solution to dealing with this regime perhaps that should be left up to Washington. Remember it was the American leaders who aided the Taleban with weapons training and supplying them with weapons including Stinger Missiles which shot down civilian airliners. They learned their lessons so well that a few of the trainees blew up the World Trade Centre in New York with this training. If the American leaders wish to play Dr. Frankenstein then it is their responsibility to deal with the monster they created.      I suppose it's a question of rules and just how they are played by. The Taleban may be odious and repugnant to many but like it or not they are supported by many including Middle East countries and of course Pakistan which is not exactly a pillar of democracy. Stop the sanctions not only in Afghanistan but also in Iraq for instance and at least the immense suffering of the peoples can be alleviated. You will never get this bunch of extremists to change their views whatever you do so why should simple folk suffer? I am not for the Taleban in any way but I am for human rights and by making the people of that nation suffer for the weird ways of their leaders is making the sanctions makers just as guilty as the Taleban. Sanctions as a weapon is outdated and unnecessary in this day and age. "
HOC HOC-IO -0.00999999999999973 " It's of no consequence. There is currently a democratic senator who may lose his seat due to criminal charges being brought against him. Not only that but it is projected that in the midterm elections the Republican Party will take back the Senate. Jeffords' defection will give the democrats a short-lived victory. There are a lot of conservatives here in the U.S. I'm 22 years old and a lot of young adults like me find our parents liberal ways distasteful. Soon enough we will take the reins of government and when we do, Clinton's policies will go the way of the dodo.      This is liberalism versus extreme conservatism. Bush has to know that a mandate he had to become the president was not overwhelming. Liberal thinking is the way to go for Americans, not the extreme right. Just in the wings also to quit Republican Senate will be John McCain, his adversary. This will be a nail in the coffin for the Republican agenda. Liberalism will triumph.      Michael, UK, shows an interesting ignorance of a system he is so ready to criticise. Senators represent the state populations, not the parties of which they happen to be members. We want our Senators to use their own judgements, not merely mouth party platforms or ape poll findings. Jeffords is an unfortunately rare specimen of what we want.      Gradually, Americans are waking up to the fact that George W. Bush is a 'puppet' for corporations that have no interest in the environment, health care, or energy - other than to pilfer the public. The change taking place in the U.S. now is coming much later than I had originally anticipated. But, make no mistake, there are new changes coming and they are going to be in the interests of the Democrats and the majority of Americans who vote.      Senator Jeffords' defection makes not an iota of difference to world politics. I know this is a truism, but democracy died a horrible death a long time ago. There isn't much choice left by way of ideology any more. Take your pick: corporate rule today or corporate rule tomorrow.      It amazes me that the Americans can persuade themselves that they have a constitutional state: after the fiasco of the election, which was only decided when the wrong man conceded, they can now allow the Senate to be run by a party the people didn't vote for. Even if it means reconsidering fundamental aspects of the constitution, the Americans must consider the possibility that it's time to change their electoral system, and to make it make sense.      Whoever thinks there will be no change is deceiving themselves. The very fact that the heads of the permanent committees have been surrendered to the Democrats is already a change. Even if the there is no total blockade of Bush's reforms he will suffer a great deal from delaying tactics. Remember that he has only 4 years while the Senators have 6 years. He is the one in a hurry they are in no hurry.      I voted for Ralph Nader. I hope the defection will bring a change. But, I am not going to lose sleep over it.      Jeffords' switch of parties was not only good for the country, it was good for Bush. Since his election, Bush has been trying very hard to please the far right wing of the Republican party. These are the same people who abandoned Bush's father because they thought he was too soft on the liberals. Now that the Democrats control the Senate, Bush will be forced to moderate somewhat. This will be both good for the country because there were too many right wing policies being pushed through the legislature as well as good for Bush who will now start to be seen as more of a moderate. He knows that this will be better for him in the long run if he wants to be re-elected.      George Bush has to establish an energy policy because there was none previously. If conservation was the only answer, California wouldn't have a problem. Global warming is poorly understood. The media has less understanding of it than do scientists. Several ice ages have come and gone without industry on the planet.      We need to be ahead militarily. When we entered WWII we were poorly prepared. I don't trust the Chinese communists. And finally, if it would make you EU folks feel better, the next time there is trouble on your continent, you can liberate yourselves. When Germany rolls into France in 2015 I say let them have it. By the way, an EU ""rapid reaction"" force is laughable given past history.      It is ridiculous to continually describe US politics as democratic. This is not, nor has it ever been, a democracy. The US is a prime example of an oligarchy, which can easily be illustrated by our political campaign finance system. It is impossible for a person to run for any office in the US without the financing provided by the parties (only two really) and the various monied interests which make the donations to them. As a life-long voter I have finally realised the futility of joining this sad hypocrisy. As for Mr. Jeffords, I say ""Good Work"" at least in this instance, since shaking up the power structure even a little means a great deal to me. At least in Britain you have limited the campaign season and its financing to prevent your country from being as obviously dumb as our system has made us be.      It amazes me how the Bush agenda is characterized as extreme right-wing. It also amazes me at how many in the UK take such swipes at Bush over the ABM treaty and the environment. It is time to realize that the more free market capitalism of the US has worked well. Let's not break it. The Democrats will.      Why are some members of the Republican Party so upset at the Honourable Member for Vermont changing parties by means of ""an outrageous defection""? The USN has a destroyer named after a man who changed political parties twice, one Winston Spencer Churchill.      I voted today in a school funding election here in California. I hope that my support of strong state schools will create a generation smart enough to pick up the mess being created by Bush today. The Democrats can't stop it; they're too weak and conservative. There is no Labour party here to stop the right-wing juggernaut. Appreciate what you have, Britain, or you may lose it and end up like us.      The so-called democratic process has been ill served by Jeffords' untimely change of allegiance. The wellbeing of the United States as a whole has never been at the top of the agenda for the Democrats and now that the balance of power has shifted in the Senate, we can look forward to the United States being sold further down the river - a sale that started 8 years ago. God help America.      Thank God for our hero, Jim Jeffords. He has given Dems the chance to restore checks and balances in the US Senate. The Repubs are going to try to gridlock the Senate in order to fill judicial seats with possible radical, far right-wing people. The Repubs want to bypass traditional and legal procedures to rush these people into judicial seats such as the American Bar Association, which has traditionally interviewed these people before their considerations reach the Senate. I have to wonder what it is about this common American tradition that makes Repubs so anxious, even to the point of declaring war in the Senate.      James' defection was a great day for mankind! I strongly believe that no one can overestimate just how huge this event is for America, and the world in general. No other empire in the history of the world even comes close to the influence the USA has on global affairs. Dampening Bush's neo-conservative ambition allows me to sleep better at night! Wait until McCain decides to run as an independent in 2004 - oh, the future smells good...      We are still reeling from the election 2000 coup d'etat. The disenfranchisement of the people's vote, the complete lock-down of the media, the corruption of the electoral process as well as collusion of the Supreme Court undermines the very essence of our fragile democracy here in these United States. A shift in the balance of power is a necessary beginning to wrest control of our government from the grip of corporate interests.      Switching parties is one of the oldest games in democracy. Well, one could always argue pros and cons of this issue. I take the perspective that when one is giving their ballot, he or she should assume that there could be a switch after someone is elected. It is also a tool in a political game where the governing body would be kept on their toes. It is a democratic thing to do.      As an outsider looking in, I can say that there is a rising number of foreigners looking in that believe that very little separates the two parties. They are two parties that lean to the right in varying degrees. The backbone of the US is of course its economy. For outsiders, all this means is ""how will the US Government continue to defy the US public? Do they not know that rhetoric and practice of market democracy is not a democracy for people but instead for big business? Both parties support such a democracy. Therefore, both are right-wing as far as far as public representation is concerned.      Let's hope the Democrats bring a little normality back to American politics and help steer the country off the dangerous road it's been going down since the election.      With the Senate at 50-50, it should have been obvious that in order for anything to get done some bipartisanship was needed. Jefford's departure shows the power that he and other moderates in both parties have. For all of you who feel that his defection was illegal or unpopular, recognise that unlike parliamentary systems such as Britain, senators cross their own parties often, since they are accountable only to the voters who elected them. He did what he felt would be best for himself and his constituents. Considering that Vermont's only congressman is an independent and his state is quite liberal (voting for Gore), his actions probably were in lock step with his constituents.      Of course it will make a difference. Democrats are closer to 'people realities' especially the middle class. They will push for policies and agendas that are more meaningful to the greater majority of Americans and push back on those that favour the corporations and the 'really rich'. Additionally, in spite of now being in the majority and having major differences with the Republicans, I do not see the Democrats stalling proceedings or holding up the passage of spending budgets etc as the Republicans shamelessly did during the Clinton era.      North of the US, it is premature to think changes to the already polluted environment in the Great Lakes region will be implemented. Bush has vowed to increase coal burning generators to the maximum. I wish we could smile a bit if it is thwarted. Also, the ambitious oil pipeline from the Arctic to the US will be a disaster to the natural environment. I hope the Democrats ditch these environmentally unfriendly projects.      While the Senate was Republican-controlled, President Bush's idea of Congressional ""bipartisanship"" was to intimidate Democratic Senators whose states had overwhelmingly voted for Bush, and threaten to campaign against them on their next election. With the Democrats now in control, Bush will no longer be able to side-step the Democratic leadership, who will control the Senate's agenda.      I suppose in retrospect, nothing has come easy for Bush or his administration, and perhaps that's the way that it should be. From here on out, Bush will have to ""sell"" his policies rather than force-feed them. I do feel that Jefford's actions are at best suspect, but a Senate divided has always been good for politics because neither party can dominate legislation, and that is the point of checks and balances and distribution of power.      This is not going to make much difference. First, President Bush already got the appalling tax cut passed and there is very little money to go around for such things as fixing Medicare or health benefits. Secondly, it does not matter all that much who is running the government, for the most part big money runs our government and they will make sure they send enough money the Democrats way to ensure the business community gets what it wants. Thirdly, remember that most Bush policies have passed with 10+ Democratic senators supporting them, this will not change with committee chairmanship control.      President Bush's detractors consistently hammer away at his ideas but they never seem willing or able to propose solutions to the problems that continue to plague us all. Yet Bush consistently chooses not to be aggressive in putting forth his ideas in the absence of solutions others should be proposing. Personally, I don't agree with all of Bush's ideas and I find some of them just plain laughable. However, it's really not his job to go out and set the agenda and solve problems as much as it is to foster a comfortable working atmosphere and bring people together to solve the nation's problems. Unfortunately, a general lack of teamwork on both sides of the political fence makes that all but impossible.      This change does not necessarily hand power in the Senate over to the Democrats, it hands power to Jeffords who is independent and will be able to control which bills are passed and which ones are blocked by switching sides as he pleases, effectively promoting his own agenda in the process. These are interesting times indeed...      No-one should call Sen. Jefford's defection ""illegal"". The disappointment of conservative Americans is understandable, but the majority of Gore supporters did the right thing in finally understanding that George W. Bush had become their legitimate, constitutional president, no matter what the public vote said, or how narrow the outcome of the presidential elections had been. Now, Sen. Jefford's defection is just as constitutional and legitimate, as Mr Bush's presidency.      It is misleading for Mr Jeffords to call himself ""independent"". For all intents and purposes he has effectively made himself the most powerful man in the Senate.      There will be little damage to President Bush's agenda, but there will be massive damage to the Democrats. Their illegal activities in the 2000 election and then this dishonourable action will turn people against them.      In response to A. Carrier. We agree on two points - neither Bush nor Clinton had a mandate of the people, and the Senate shift will change the agenda of US government. But let's remember that the most we bleeding-from-every-pore liberals can hope for is that the shift in priorities will be from left of centre to the centre. As for the welfare mentality, death of free speech of any kind, increased pregnancies? The alignment of lobbyists and politicians from both sides with major corporate interests has increased the disparity between the wealthy and the poor. Hurray, for one senator's decision to stir things up and shift the current order.      This is only good if the Democrats have the guts to stand up to the Right-wing agenda of this appointed administration. Last year the whole world watched the American presidency get stolen by a group of shameless right wing judges who decided that their vote meant more than millions of us. Now maybe the Senate will block any more such judges taking office.      Thank God, Americans have a way of finally countering the coarse policies of republicans and Bush and his cronies. No longer do we have to wince when he makes decisions that make America seem like an inconsiderate world bully. The democrats are much more sympathetic to world concerns and the environment.      The Jeffords switch was another ridiculous power ploy engineered by a few power brokers who have been unabashedly working this deal for months. While those elected officials have been busy getting the lines redrawn to benefit themselves, there are still a few Senators (in BOTH parties) who have, thankfully, been hard at work on the business of fixing the multitude of problems our country faces. Unfortunately, their efforts may be seriously hindered by the self-serving political machine we now see rising to power. I certainly do not see Jeffords as a ""conscientious person who is looking out for the best interests of [his] country"", but more like a pawn of the political power brokers.      Of course the senate power change will make a difference. The democrat party will try to obstruct the republicans' agenda and also to set themselves up favourably for the elections in two years. This may not be to their advantage, since the senate is not as sensitive to control as the house of representatives is. The republicans still have a lot of power in such a closely divided senate. The republicans may have to abandon their niceness campaign, and actually develop a backbone. I can only hope...      If Hitler had lost his power like Bush just did, maybe we would have never had World War II. The whole world can sleep a bit easier at night.      Yes there will be a difference but not as much of a difference as big money makes in Congress and the Senate. Although the two major US political parties claim to have the best plan for the American people, both parties step in line to corporate lobbies and their money. All you have to do is look at the number of mega mergers and lack of universal health coverage in the US.      Although I'm a voting Democrat, I think the defection was outrageous. If any politician wants to switch parties, that's fine, but let the people go back to polls. The majority of people vote on the basis of political party. It's my guess that if Jeffords had to test his popularity now, he'd lose to the Republican nominee.      We have seen enough of Bushism. This narrow-minded government has to be kept in check. I feel that the change in the Senate will certainly be good for the ""Hard working Americans"".      Yes it will be good! This means that now there will be serious opposition to Bush and to his policies. This means that he cannot push them through so easily. I imagine that this has happened because of the general global outrage to his policies such as rejecting Kyoto, scraping the ABM Treaty and opening up national wildlife reserves. Hopefully this means that for the next three and a half years there will be serious deliberations over the policies suggested and Bush can be stopped before acting before he thinks.      The change in the Senate will be very good for the US democratic process. The Republicans have been steamrolling over popular sentiment with their conservative agenda despite having no mandate, and a change in party in one of the houses of the legislative branch will at least check conservative excesses. After the election, the Senate was split evenly anyway, and the tie-breaking vote was to be cast by a Vice President that was elected under the most dubious of circumstances. Everyone knows that the American electorate is split right down the middle and that neither side has any mandate whatsoever to lead.      Those who are outraged at Mr Jeffords' actions do not understand the principles upon which the American republic was founded. Political parties were never intended to be a guiding mechanism of our society - indeed, George Washington, who belonged to no party, warned against the rise of partisan politics. In the USA, candidates may belong to parties, but that is simply a mechanism for getting on the ballot. The word ""party"" does not appear a single time in the Constitution. We elect individuals, not parties. Mr. Jeffords is a man of courage, because he did what he had to do, within the bounds of the law, to see that the principles he believes in are upheld. Those who would condemn him for that, be ashamed.      If indeed legislative gridlock or political stalemate are the order of the day, I'd say that this is a far better than giving the keys to the US government to only one party. Perhaps no change is better than a wholesale movement to the right. Thank you Senator Jeffords for throwing a monkey wrench into the works! You are indeed a very conscientious person who is looking out for the best interests of your country.      Anyone who makes Bush think twice is worth supporting.      This damage to Republican dominance in Washington is good for the democratic process. It will help redress the injustice that American democracy suffered in the recent ""election"", in which Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were appointed to power not by the people but by Republican-nominated Supreme Court justices.      I'm not worried about Bush. For all his faults, he's shown the abilities to compromise when he was governor. What does worry me are the other Right wing extremists in the Senate who are taking the defection personally and would bring the government to a halt out of spite.      ...and the whole world sighed in relief...      In regards to Neal's comment about Jeffords' probability of losing an election now, I disagree. I'm a Vermonter and I can tell you that recent local polls show that Jeffords' approval rating is over 70% in this state. We are traditionally an independent state with our only House member an Independent (Bernie Sanders). Most of us applaud his courage and honesty and we acknowledge that he hasn't aligned with the Republicans for years. What Florida taketh, Vermont giveth back.      I just had to respond to the comments of Siassa from Canada. I'm really sick of people who are harping that Bush doesn't have a mandate to govern because he barely won the electoral vote. Were you saying the same thing back in 1992 when 57% of the voters specifically DIDN'T vote for Clinton? I doubt it. Yes, the Senate shift will help the cause of liberalism.      Answer me this, are the following conditions in America due to Conservative thinking or Liberal thinking? The death of free speech on college campuses. Drug use. Increased teen pregnancies. Subsequent teen abortions. The welfare and entitlement mentatlity. Billions wasted on a ""war on poverty"" in which we've seen virtually no percentage of poverty decrease. Calling regimes like China our ""strategic partners"". Think these things were brought about by Conservatives? Think again.      Hopefully it will make some change to Bush's ability to force his proposals through the Senate. Any change to that is a good change. The Son of Star Wars programme can hopefully be stopped. George Bush needs to stop his act now and think 50-years-later and look at the real world. "
HOC HOC-IS -0.19 " People are only human and ALL human beings are prone to succumbing to temptation. How about installing a complex, moderated computer system to run governments around the world? You can't bribe a machine!      Transparency International has done an excellent job here in Slovakia in the past few years. It has made the issue of corruption a permanent topic of discussion, and a good number of public figures have had to leave their posts in disgrace, labelled as corrupt - while the TE's Slovak representative has been proclaimed the woman of the year! But there's still a long way to go, especially at lower levels - hospitals, school entry examinations, permits, etc. Such cases rarely hit the news...      As long as society is capital orientated, corruption is inevitable. We're living in a society where everyone wants to amass as much wealth as he/ she can. Someone wants to be a millionaire, and a millionaire wants to be a billionaire. So some will try dubious means to get to the top quicker.      Everywhere you go you see corruption. I've just come back from Syria and couldn't believe what I saw - you have to pay for everything there. At the airport I even had to pay for my passport so that I could get it earlier than other people.      In my country corruption used to be common practice everywhere from a higher level to the lower grass roots. It was becoming part of our traditional cultural values and it was feared that it might not be controlled by the government of Pakistan. Now things have changed a bit under the military regime. But it is still a far-fetched idea to say that corruption can be removed from the world. It's like a contagious disease which has infected the whole structure of government.      Corruption is inevitable, but certain circumstances can increase it to grotesque proportions. Here elected parliamentary members are expected to be board members of various businesses as their only source of income. This region also has very low tax rates which have combined to make corruption such a way of life in providing a high and regular source of revenue that it seems to be no longer noticed. For many, therefore, it ceases to be a problem of conscience.      I'm from Ecuador in South America where corruption is just part of our lives. Two years ago I got my ID and driver's licence stolen from my car. The right thing to do was to go and apply for them again. But it was a process that could take too long, so I did what everybody else does, I paid someone to get the documents for me.      Should we leave behind or give tips when a service is rendered? Should we give presents on birthdays or during festive seasons? If 'yes' to all of the above, are we not practising and encouraging a kind of corruption?      Your comments before we went ON AIR      The only way to minimise graft is to limit politicians to a fixed term in office. There are so many professional politicians, particularly in the US. For example, former President Clinton has never worked in the private sector!      Because corruption exists, does not mean to say it's right. It's an abuse of the very standards that the human race sets itself to uphold. If Finland can uphold such high standards, and still do well, why can't others?      Having had the ""good fortune"" of attending a private school in one of the most highly corrupt countries in the world (Bangladesh), I was able to see corruption in action from very close quarters. I was surrounded by the sons and daughters of the elite, most of whom have amassed their enormous fortunes, courtesy of rampant corruption.      What is corruption? Accepting an expensive pair of shoes for turning a blind eye to the activities of a friendly company is. But surely, so is accepting campaign funds from big corporations and then reneging on global environmental treaties? It's just that little bit harder to be caught red-handed.      Rule No.1: Corruption is an ordinary crime! Rule No.2: There are no inevitable crimes! Personally I'm very glad to watch the news nowadays which clearly show that no politician, neither in the Far East nor in the ""civilized"" West can feel safe when taking bribes. No matter how powerful he is...or used to be. Mr. Kohl and Mr. Dumas...      Is there any country in this world that is not corrupt? Corruption exists because there is a giver and a taker. The giver corrupts because he wants the rules to be bent so that he can make a quick profit. The taker need corrupt money to satisfy his. As long as there is greed in a society there will be corruption. One might say India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Philippines are the most corrupt of all nations in the world. I would include USA. The American President is elected through a complicated system that paves the way for business lobbies to fund parties for future favours. Just one example; no president would go against China trade in spite of human rights violations because of American investments in China. This is an example of indirect corruption.      As appeared on these web pages and in the Economist, the least corrupt nation in the world is Finland. As an Englishman living here for a few years now, I can understand why. The Finns are also the third most competitive nation in the world in terms of economic performance, government and business efficiency and infrastructure (Time May 7th from World Competitiveness Yearbook). This proves that it can pay not to be corrupt and still be very effective in business.      In one country it is called fund-raising (forgetting about following decisions, the administration makes in favour of the donors), and in some other country it is straight pay-upfront-and-get what you want. Whether we accept it or not, it is everywhere. However we should also accept that not all are corrupt. I had a chance to act corrupt in my career with government, but never succumbed to it.      It takes a strong character to withstand temptation in high places...      Bribery, corruption, embezzlement has always been with us - its human nature. I think the 95% of people, given the opportunity, would accept a bribe - if they thought that no one would know.      Accepting that corruption is widespread, albeit a lot less obvious in first world countries than in developing or third world countries, the problem is that those who see it and report it are the losers. How can this be changed? How can the ""whistle blower"" be supported and upheld?      It is all very well for the protesters in America and Europe to call for forgiveness of debt to Third World countries, saying that debt is keeping them in poverty. In reality corruption in government is what is bringing these countries to their knees. To say it is inevitable is to condone it.      In Scotland, parliament voted on some legislation to compensate fishermen, only for the executive to overturn the democratic will of the people because it didn't suit them. If that was done in a country like Iraq it would be considered the height of corruption, yet in voting-apathetic Britain this is accepted without fuss. That's democracy for you: politicians are allowed to be corrupt, but only with the tacit consent of the people.      I thought the whole reason that bureaucracies were invented wasn't to eliminate corruption, but to minimize corruption by compartmentalizing and limiting the damage that anyone person can do. But methinks the paradigm has changed in the age of automation, as now a single person in the right spot with the inclination and skill can wreak havoc.      I guess the comment about ""Power corrupts"" comes to peoples mind, but I don't take that negative view. It assumes that everybody is corruptible, it assumes the concept of original sin to be true.      I think it is more accurate to say: ""Power attracts the corruptible"". There can be honesty in politics/business/etc, but we are force-fed a diet of movies and media that tell us that everyone has skeletons in their closet. The majority no longer look for, hope for nor expect honesty, and the expectation breeds the result.      Power simply corrupts, and that is why we should simply not trust people with power, be it a politician or the saint next door!      The issue of corruption will never go away until we reach the Utopia, where everybody's dreams of a better life have been fulfilled. As long as poverty, class, hegemony of control, etc exist there will be corruption. ""What is in it for me?"", as I call it here in Kenya, will continue to bring down politicians, and other people of power. In West Africa the Ibos say ""He who brings kola brings life"", I think this is corruption in the essence of the struggle to excel, in today's rat-race job market and super profit goals.      Where there is power there is corruption, always has been always will be...      Lets face it, most of us would like a good salary hike. What happens if you refuse? Thankfully as a laboratory worker I'm not in a ""bribeable"" situation. It does seem to be part of business culture in some far eastern countries though. Sad. It's surprising it's not more widespread.      In my country we had so much corruption. We were in major debt with our allies and our financial connections for example with the World Funds. We were in so much trouble when Nawaz Sharif was in power...he was found to have taken most of the money and saved it for himself. Our military decided enough is enough and ousted the money hungry PM out of office. This year I came back to see the country I had once left and saw a major positive change. There are more jobs, less poverty, more water, more food, more security and the list goes on. It is good to have an uncorrupt regime. So whatever the world says about us getting back to democracy, they should first see what kind of corruption they have in their government.      Corruption is part of us. We all want to hook some up or if we want something done and we know someone, we consider it easily done. It is ingrained in our speech when we say that we know the right people or ""we have the right contacts"". These right contacts may have to bend a little too, in order to accommodate our requests. Basically when one person causes the other to be corrupt, none of them is less guilty than the other. But as long as our mentality remains like this, we are destined to be a corrupt race, some more than others.      Due to human nature it is inevitable, but can be minimised within a properly designed and maintained regime - in the same way as most of us don't burgle our neighbours' houses. However, it is far more likely now since the last Tory government replaced the notion of Public Service with that of Authority Without Responsibility.      I could not agree more that corruption is an inevitable phenomenon in the global community. I strongly believe that the practice, though relative to locations, is an endemic component of our economic fabric. This tends to be true whether it's a market economy, socialist and/ or traditional systems. The difference being on how it is regulated and to what extent it is tolerated by societies. I think no one could cite a corruption free country/ system or disprove it otherwise.      A certain amount is inevitable. Certainly reliance on economic systems with little or no competition for services, where success is determined by who one knows is more than what one knows, virtually guarantees a higher level of corruption. This is obviously true for more strongly socialist systems because one party (the government) provides so many of life's services or make all of the decisions and they are a monopoly.      Power breeds corruption. The more power a person has, the more corrupt they tend to be. It's a simple truth. Very few people have the personal self-control required to prevent them from abusing the system. Then, once the first abuse has occurred, which may be very minor, more and worse abuses come easier and easier. You can see it everywhere. In business, if a director gets caught committing some serious offence, they normally take early retirement or just leave. They don't normally get prosecuted or sacked. Politicians are very similar. Corruption almost goes with the job. There are also different types of corruption. Is claiming benefits you are technically allowed, but morally shouldn't corruption? Is claiming for 1st class air fares and actually travelling by train corruption (EU MEPS)?      Corruption is only inevitable if your organisation has poor systems of control, lazy management and an ethos of corruption. Something that cannot be said about our much maligned public services. Our civil service as an example is probably one of the finest in the world well controlled and full of people with a genuine public servant spirit. How easily such ideals are lost if they are not nurtured.      Unfortunately this seems to be the way of things these days. There is such a focus in society on being rich that greed has taken over. People are susceptible to money, at the end of the day, we all need it, but we cannot stop at what we need, we have to have more. To get to the position of importance, unfortunately it may be necessary to get there by not strictly legitimate means, as if you don't act underhandedly, someone else will. Unfortunately the good guys rarely win these days.      Yes, in any organization where power and money flow freely corruption is going to and does happen. However we must remember that a lot of our politicians become civil servants out of a feeling of duty and a bond with their fellow citizens. Many truly want to serve their neighbours and do whatever they can to make sure their concerns are voiced. It is sad a few bad apples ruin the perception of our elected officials.      I think that it is not wise to generalise corruption as inevitable. Rather I think the primary cause for corruption in the modern world is due to its current emphasis on the automatic acceptance of any profit, sustained growth forever, more comfort at the expense of anything and the growth of multi-national organisations even if they do not care a mote about the well-being of its employees or the local inhabitants.      The issue of ""corruption"" is not very well defined; personally, I broadly translate the word as ""abuse of power"". In this case, corruption is everywhere. Businessmen earning half a million pounds a year surely do not do enough work to merit that amount of money! The only demarcation line between Estrada, Dumas and the boss of Railtrack is the issue of legality. Morally, however, these cases are the same.      As far as corruption in France is concerned, the sentence imposed on Mr Dumas is setting the ground for others. We've heard about the case of Roland Dumas unfolding for quite some time without really being able to predict when justice impose a sentence on him. It comes as a bit of blow. I think it does no harm to see the corruption issue being tackled in our country, although they are politicians for whom I have no more respect than Dumas, Mr Pasqua, Mr Tiberi on the right wing for instance. Even president Chirac is threatened. It seems that a taboo has fallen or rather is in the process of falling in France and that corruption is meant to be condemned.      Living as we humans do, bribery, corruption, or lobbying is our ancient method of bartering. What we need is to have a global governance representative of the people working at the grassroots level, so that no human is poor and no human is exceedingly rich, as wealth is measured where I live as your health. Oiling the wheel of the machine just means someone else gets crushed in the process. Working to one peaceful, loving end is the only way on a large scale.      Corruption is inevitable. Human nature makes it unavoidable.      The easiest way to stop petty corruption in society is to forget the concept that all services should be supplied equally to all people. This is a very hard step to take and to some extent undermines the equality of citizens in a society. But it is the correct step.     In this part of Switzerland people talk of ""copinage"" - a sort of ""it's who you know"". It is considered quite normal by respectable individuals to use links with people they know to get jobs, obtain favours or even avoid police punishment. Is this corruption?      In developing countries corruption is rife because wages are really low. It is accepted as part of life by the people and viewed merely as a means of oiling the machinery to get daily activities done smoothly without hassle. Corruption takes many forms and in developed countries it is camouflaged as lobbying. Multinational corporations pay for costly political campaigns and when their candidate wins it is pay back time. "
HOC HOC-JI -0.13 " I was once caught by my managing director wandering around our company's basement, with a large cardboard box on my head, pretending to be Dalek shouting 'Exterminate! Exterminate!' Does that count as a blunder? He never took me seriously again after that...      I found myself having a cup of coffee with my supervisor when a very attractive woman walked by. I made a low growl and remarked how great it would be to, well, get to know her better. It was his daughter.      Some of these 'blunders' described here are actually very dangerous and if the right (or wrong) person saw them and decided to do something about it, they could track the confessor down and take serious action against then! Beware.      Mine was a blunder that could have cost me my job. A friend and I had been e-mailing each other about how much we hated my boss. I listed all kinds of rude remarks about him. Somehow I managed to accidentally forward the mail to the boss concerned. Fortunately I realised my mistake as it disappeared from my screen and I was able to sprint upstairs to the server room and catch it as it passed through the mail system about 30 seconds later! I had never gone up stairs four-at-a-time until then....      My worse blunder - it still makes me wake up in the night in a cold sweat - turning down the chance to register a selection of .com domains in 1997 - one of which was subsequently sold for $2 Million Dollars six months later.      This wasn't me, but a friend of mine. He worked for a company that processed geological survey data for oil prospecting and one day managed to erase a computer tape containing results from a recent survey expedition. I think he just put the blank tape back in the rack and hoped no one would notice. (You know who you are, Gavin!)      My biggest work blunder was throwing away what I thought was an empty envelope after cashing up the tills. Unfortunately the envelope contained #500 in #50 notes which was noticed the next day when my boss checked the figures, too late as the rubbish had gone.      I used to have an evening job in a cafe in a leisure centre where we sold soft drinks through a dispenser on a counter. The drink is made from a highly concentrated syrup fed through pipes from the cellar and mixed with carbonated water as it comes out of the dispenser. We were really busy and ran out of coke so I ran downstairs to the cellar, took off the empty coke box and attached a new one. When I got back upstairs we couldn't pull the coke through so I went back down to discover that in my haste I had attached the coke to the lemonade pipe which had been left unattached after the last box of lemonade syrup was finished.      Imagine this. You are deputy Prime Minister of the UK during an election campaign when a protester throws an egg at you. Do you i) act with the dignity and restraint that befits your high public office or ii) turn round and smack him in the gob? Guess which I chose! Dohhhhhhh. . .      I worked at a DIY store as a student and apart from the many 'blunders' that were arranged on purpose to alleviate a boring shift (e.g. deliberately cutting the bottom of a 50kg cement bag so it split over whoever picked it up) there was one that I still cringe about to this day. A half-empty tin of white gloss paint had to be put into the skip at the back of the store. I took it out, but as it was cold, decided to throw the tin into the open-top skip about 10 yards from where I stood. Unfortunately, the skip was not of the open-top variety. The tin rolled off the top of the skip and exploded on the ground showering the managers new car with white gloss paint. It cost be half a day's pay in car wash bills.      My worst blunder was sending an e-mail about my boss to my partner saying that he was bad tempered and difficult to work with. I had written it in Spanish but my boss not only read my personal e-mail, he also had the e-mail translated. Suffice to say I left the company very soon after as I could not work with someone who invaded my privacy like that. However it is a warning to everyone - it doesn't matter how private you think your e-mail is - the boss will read it even in another language - what happened to trust? Anyway it taught me a big lesson!      Not mine, but our loading bay staff managed to leave #0.5 million of highly sensitive computing backup equipment outside a door they said they couldn't get through. This was then compounded by forgetting about it and leaving it there for a week in sub-zero temperatures. Oops!      My second worst blunder was ticking the 'overtime' box (#35/h) instead of the '24x7 standby' box (#4/h) thereby inflating my monthly pay packet by #7,500. My biggest ever blunder was telling my boss, who told me that I was a mug and should keep quiet in future.      It wasn't my blunder, but I made the most of it... I joined a company (which I have since left, thankfully) and asked the payroll department for my salary details so that I could arrange a mortgage. The lady e-mailed me with the salary details. However, my e-mail inbox said that this message had an attachment, which I couldn't find. I eventually double-clicked on the salary details part of the message - and up came a spreadsheet containing everyone's current salary and bonus allowance, and how much they were to be given in the upcoming salary review! I saw that some senior people were getting considerably less than more junior people, and that the unpopular MD had written some comments on the spreadsheet that were less than complimentary about most of his employees. I got a new job, resigned a week or so later, took the spreadsheet with me and e-mailed it to every employee of the (small) company from an anonymous hotmail address.      A colleague was called out at midnight to fix a fail in a computer run of an application that ran the factory we work for and deleted the full application by hitting the D(elete) key on his computer keyboard instead of the S(elect). Luckily we have back up copies of every file so he did manage to recover everything but it was a frightening experience seeing years of work disappear by pressing in a split second.      Whilst enjoying some 'horse play' with several others in our open plan office, I decided to throw a protractor at a colleague. It missed him but continued to sail in a graceful arc like a boomerang until it slammed right into the middle of my boss' face, breaking his glasses and earning me a written warning.      I once interviewed the redoubtable Raquel Welch by telephone for the magazine where I work. After opening with a couple of facetious ice-breaking remarks that only made things frostier, I decided to get on with the interview and nearly hung up on her as I wrestled with the intercom system on my telephone. She couldn't hear me; I could hear her, sighing impatiently as she waited for me to return to the line. Things worked out well in the end, but those were a trying 30 seconds that almost cost the magazine a valuable feature article.      My worst blunder was sending a fax to the CEO of a client company which set out the salary and benefit details for him and the CFO. Both had come from the US parent company to sort out the ailing UK business. Unfortunately I sent the fax to the wrong number within the business and eventually all the UK employees got to see how much the two were being paid. Let's just say the disparity between these two and the rest of the UK team was embarrassingly wide.     I once lost over #1 million worth of communications equipment in the post from the US. Thing is the company didn't even notice which just goes to show that they're far more interested in stopping people claiming a few more pounds on their expenses than auditing what's going on in the company as a whole - Typical.      Well, it seems there aren't that many prepared to admit to blunders. I myself have blundered through jobs and life with a recklessness that could be compared to this man's error. However, you only learn by your mistakes and it will very frequently be the management's error which enabled a mistake of such magnitude to occur on trading books. So TAKE HEART whoever you are - go for business on your own grounds where management will not fail and then renounce you!      I don't make blunders...      Um... getting caught posting messages to the BBC News Talking Point Website? Fortunately my employer is relaxed about internet usage - within reasonable bounds. So the other blunder will have to be talking in less than glowing terms about a former schoolmate who shared the same unusual surname as a co-worker in my office. I don't think I need explain what happened next...      I know of a staffer at a Senator's office in Washington who had something of a crush on the Senator and, to make her boyfriend jealous, decided to fax him, on official headed paper, describing all the things she wanted to do to the Senator. Not knowing how to use the fax machine, she naturally pressed the button that said ""press"". Her fax went to every newspaper and TV station in the state.      I committed my worst blunder by joining the company that I work for at present.      I once accidentally deleted three years of archived data from a database. I was rather embarrassed by this blunder, but not as embarrassed as our database support team were when they tried to recover the lost data from the backup tapes: and found that all the backups made since the last software upgrade three months before were corrupt and unrecoverable. They made sure they verified all the backups after that.      I used to drive tanks in the army. In the wide, open desert with absolutely no obstacles I fell asleep whilst asleep and drove my vehicle into the back end of another tank......cringe....      Rebooted the wrong server - resulting in collapse of a large international broker being unable to trade for about 2 hours while the systems desperately resynchronised. How many millions of $ worth of business were lost we never did find out.      While I was working at an NHS laundry, the main washing machine (about 20m long) had broken down and was being repaired and re- welded. Unfortunately the Welder had earthed himself to the drum of the machine without realising it and as well as shooting across the building like Gonzo from the Muppets he managed to fuse all the electric's in the washer. The two-week repair delay cost us two major contracts and the laundry closed 6 months later! By then I was working for the local cable company, but that's a different story...      Having had numerous and varied jobs, my blunders have also been numerous and varied, from turning a woman's hair green as an apprentice hairdresser, to putting overtime on half the mechanics' time cards at a factory while training in the office. In the end I thought it safer for all concerned to retire from the workplace.      Based in Bedfont, Middlesex at the time, I was arranging an appointment for one of my sales managers in Hull. The person he was meeting with phoned the day before to postpone but I failed to pass on the message to the sales manager. The following day he phoned me from the car on his enormously long journey all chirpy and cheerful 'for a chat' on his boring journey and I happily talked to him totally forgetting about the postponement. A couple of hours later, he phoned again and his tone of voice was much more serious this time. You know that feeling when your heart disappears through the end of your toes at twice the speed of sound???? "
HOC HOC-KJ -0.17 "  I'm an Albanian living in the USA. I often ask myself what and who brought me here. As many would guess, unfortunately, thanks to Mr Butcher's genocide and persecution, my family ended up separated in the miserable Macedonian camps. Those who think that Milosevic is innocent or should not be tried in The Hague - they are his collaborators. Even if all war criminals were behind The Hague's bars, justice would not have been done compared to the mass killings they have committed. Nobody ever dares to mention this from high officials while the war profiteers are still chilling in their mansions. I'm afraid that justice will never be satisfied even if all of them would be behind bars. What comes around goes around!      Milosevic should be tried first by Kosovan Albanians, after that by Bosnians, and after that he should be sent to HELL, not to The Hague.  Whatever the mistakes of NATO, and I'm certainly not saying that they should be forgotten, let's get Milosevic in front of the war crimes tribunal in the Hague and for once send out a strong message to the world that the international community is not prepared to tolerate such horrendous violations of human rights in the 21st century, wherever they occur. This would be a very positive move.  First of all, nice to see that the media have found Milosevic guilty before a trial has even commenced. Also nice to see that Yugoslavia is such a democracy - arresting of opposition leaders by the government usually happens in democracies, doesn't it? Also good to see that all the troubles of the last ten years in the Balkans can be blamed on one man. Next time I am late for work or can't pay my rent I'm definitely going to blame it on Slobo. After, all it seems he's up for all charges at the moment.  Whatever he did whether it was right or wrong, he had full support of the people of Yugoslav otherwise he would not have stayed in power that long. Let those people of Yugoslav be the judge of his fate.  It is ridiculous to think that one single man, in this case Slobodan Milosevic, is solely responsible for the wars that occurred during the disintegration of a big country. It is typical of the black-and-white American mentality, but this can happen only in a Hollywood movie, not in reality.  I won't believe this until I see him behind bars for good. I don't think ""Dirty Slobo"" is finished yet. Justice? How can there be justice for the thousands killed and many more lives destroyed, unless by locking him and his like up forever?  Does it really matter where such a criminal should be tried from if justice is denied? If Milosevic is let free then the Yugoslav people will have been insulted. Milosevic's trial must therefore not be delayed  The victims of the massacres in various republics of the former Yugoslavia can only receive justice in the hands of a court that is independent of all nations. Imperfect as it is, the Hague is the place for him to be put on trial.  Justice will not be done even if Milosevic is sent to the Hague because the Hague just serves as a way of helping USA achieve its political and propaganda objectives.  The only way in which this fragmented corner of Europe can progress into the 21st century is if those who have commited crimes are brought to justice. Milosevic was able to brain wash the Yugoslav people into fighting three usless wars. His propaganda is comparable to Hitler's. Whether he faces justice at home or abroad is secondary; whatever happens, the Serb people must purge themselves and accept the crimes that their leaders commited. Only then will the Balkans go forward.  Slobodan Milosevic must really be hiding something if he has barricaded himself inside his own home, threatened to kill himself along with his family, begging the questions with the media, and cushioning his villa with supporters. It would be sweet redemption to see the many suffering people (Muslims, Croats, and others) prosecute him. firmly believe that if he is not tried for Crimes against Humanity, he's receiving the same treatment he did prior to his arrest - like a politican. Let' let the victims decide what happens to him next.      Milosevic will not be tried in The Hague - watch. Though I despise him and his supporters (wherever they maybe), in the name of Justice other leaders too should be tried. As bad as Milosevic is, American presidents have killed far more people in similar if not more brutal ways. How can we dare to claim JUSTICE when it is not applied to ALL? That is not justice - it is an affront to the universal value of EQUITY.  Yes, Milosevic should stand trial in the Hague. Yesterday the new US Ambassador-at-large used a CNN interview to pressure the Yugoslav government into handing him over. I waited to find out whether this means that the US now supports the establishment of a permanent International Court of Human Rights which can judge ALL those who transgress human rights - the question was never put. Why are the international media not asking this question?  It still amazes me that the Serbians show absolutely NO contrite whatsoever for their actions. They desire to be admitted to the EU and the UN, yet all they do is complain about how they are the victims in the war. They were so used to killing their neighbous that they were quite taken aback when they had their own noses bloodied by NATO. Then they whine about illegal bombing. Quite frankly I'm surprised Europe sat back for so long watching the horror K    I think Milosevic is no more dangerous than Clnton and Blair. I'm so tired of hearing how evil this man is and how he committed crimes against humanity when NATO strikes were just as much a vioation as anything Milosevic is accused of doing. We should put our personal feelings aside and look at the bigger picture. I guess kurstinica needs money pretty badly. If NATO says jump, weak, pathetic leaders ask, how high?  Justice seems to have an ever-changing definition, but I suppose some level of Justice will be done if Milosevic is arrested and tried. He is but one of many bullies on our planet and I suppose that we take the ones that we can get. He had the unhappy fortune of plying his trade in a critical region of the world. One where his actions could not be ingnored. Naturally, I feel that his fate would normally rest in the hands of his own people, but then they did not seem to object too strongly while his minions were systematically murdering, raping, and torturing.  He ranks with Joseph Stalin and Adolph Hitler. He should be tried at an international court, not by the people who effectively carried out his orders.  Milosevic is a dangerous and destabilising force in the Balkans who has the blood of thousands on his hands. The Yugoslav government should hold this tyrant to account for the many crimes he perputated against its population. The more complex problem of a Hague trial is one that should be dealt with time; for the moment it is important for the Yugoslav government to try Milosevic and to totally discredit the man and his suporters. Foreign interference at this stage should be kept to a mininum. In the longer term, a Hague trial is neccessary to show that crimes against humanity will not be tolerated by the world community and, where found, severely dealt with - action not words will unequivocally send this message.  It seems to me that we are facing here two different problems. First, if one asks me whether Milosevic should be tried I would certainly answer that he should be. I was one of many, many people who were on the streets of Yugoslavia in the latest days of September last year demanding from Milosevic to admit that he lost elections and resign.  On the other hand, I live in Novi Sad, the town which lost all three bridges in Nato air strikes, the town which is seriously polluted after the bombing of its oil industry. I saw the consequences of the bomb which had fallen between two civilian buildings, only 50 metres away from elementary school in Novi Sad.  And the most important, I lost in the bombing a very close friend of mine, a great man who was in that time a teaching assistant at Department of Mathematics in Novi Sad.  Will anyone ever answer to me and to other people all around the word how could that happen?      The Milosevic era must come to an end since millions of people suffered because of his utopic 'Greater Serbia' dream. To set an example he must be tried at The Hague and sentenced properly to discourage other possible dictators. At least this way the victims will get some relief.  So yes, in my opinion Milosevic should be tried. Nevertheless, only when all other leaders are treated in the same way (including Nato leaders) we could start talking about justice.  War crimes? Assassinations? Abductions? Election fraud? Gold smuggling? Sounds like the CIA.  He must be arrested, and have a trial here, in Yugoslavia, and that should include other presidents of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina etc., if we are talking about some kind of ""justice"". Every criminal should have a fair trial in his own country... so should he. But don't forget Nato bombing... who will make a judgment of their actions???  Or that is still a ""collateral mistake""?  It is very disgusting to see how those world hyenas are enjoying hunting one of the greatest Serbian leaders  The War Crimes Tribunal is a political court established and run by the West. It has little credibility anywhere else in the world. The Yugoslav authorities are free to do with Milosevic whatever they want to do; it is not Nato's or the West's business to stick their noses into this matter. Nato has already caused enough trouble in the Balkans. Let Serbia's new democratic system punish Milosevic for his anti-democratic activities.  It is a far better outcome to have the Serbs deal with their own criminals, surely?! That is, a Serbian epiphany on what is right and what is wrong is a far more desirable outcome than having it reluctantly forced down their throats! Now, if only we could get the same outcome in Iraq ...  If the Serbs are thinking of stepping on Kosovo land ever again they must prove that they are really regretting the misdeeds done by their people in our country. All we hear so far is that Serbs want Slobodan in jail because he has got their money. Sometimes I wonder do they realise what have they done to us? They don't care!  Milosevic is nothing more than a small town embezzler, not a war criminal. I think it is a bit rich for the Americans to moralise about minor civil wars like Kosovo, when they were responsible for the deaths of over two million people in the Vietnam conflict. Why weren't the likes of Nixon, Kissinger, et al., sent to The Hague for their alleged crimes?. Let his country deal with him.  There are no two ways about it. Yugoslavia is obliged, under international law and as a member of the UN, to hand Milosevic over to the tribunal in The Hague. Let's face it. The Hague wants him on charges of crimes against humanity. Yugoslavia wants to try him for embezzlement. It's a joke.      Milosevic first should be tried in his country, and then Serbia should allow him to be tried by the War Crimes Tribunal. He should, however, first serve any prison sentence imposed on him by Serbia in Serbia. If he should live beyond any sentence imposed in Serbia, he can then begin to serve time for any sentence imposed on him by the War Crimes Tribunal. The people of Serbia have a greater right to seek justice against a man who has plundered their country and caused them to suffer, than has the international community to enforce its laws. I hope, that the Serbs recognize that Milosevic's trial by the War Crimes Tribunal will not diminish Serbian justice, but provides solid international support to any convictions he may receive in Serbia.  Milosevic was not the only player in the wars of the former Yugoslavia, others are equally as punishable. We must make sure that in insisting that Milosevic is tried in an international tribunal, the West is not merely trying to make up for its past acquiescence. Why did it not stop the wars in Yugoslavia? Because it had a scapegoat, Sloba.  It is the peoples of the former Yugoslavia who have suffered most at the hands of Milosevic. The people of Serbia have been demonised in the eyes of the world, and they are the ones who have been plunged into abject poverty at his hands. Therefore it is THEY who should be the ones to have justice, and to punish Milosevic, not the international community.  I must commend America on using the threat of cutting aid to my country as a way of getting Milosevic arrested. Having incurred sanctions and bombing and causing a whole lot of pain and misery to my people this was only the next logical step. Good work for cutting aid to people who really need it. Maybe bombing us for a second time wouldnt be so bad an idea. You speak of justice? Justice will be served when ALL sides from these conflicts are brought before a court. Cutting aid to a country that really needs it is the lowest of low. Thank you USA for proving to me that you are still as narrow-minded as you always were.  Although I have no sympathy for Milosevic, I don't see much point is pressing Yugoslavia to hand him over. It won't undo the atrocities he was responsible for, and it's unlikely to act as a deterrent to future potential war criminals. The Yugoslavs suffered enough under his rule, and now that they are turning their backs on wars, I don't see why the fate of one man should get in the way of this. Let them make up their own minds on whether to hand him over.  Sending Milosevic to the Hague to face international justice is only acceptable if the same standard is applied evenly to all players involved in the Balkans - including Croatia, BH, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, and the NATO forces involved in the BalkansOK, Sophie was set up, but its inevitable in their Hello magazine world. A life of junketing and pseudo-work is not a good example to set to the young. The minor Royals should get some useful employment, not be lapping round Arab sheikhs, real or feigned. Cut off their public funding and give it to our poorest ""subjects"".      The revolution began the downward spiral for Milosovic. The West, headed by Britain and America must now embrace Yugoslavia and start them on the long track to full membership of the international community. I desperately want Milosovic's crimes to be exploited to their fullest by the Hague, but Yugoslavia is a proud nation, full of proud people, and I am slightly sceptical as to whether the new government will want to give him to outsiders. The hope that can now be seen in a democratic parliament, which began last October, is up against the 'old guard' of men left over from the Milosovic era. Milosovic must face the full force of the judiciary system, but so must other alleged war criminals from Albania, Croatia, and Bosnia. I feel we should congratulate Yugoslavia, and try to get them to the same level as the former Eastern Block countries like Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Croatia is nearly there, and with the motion that will be gained from the perpetual imprisonment of Milosovic, Yugoslavia would once again become part of 'Europe'.      What about the thousands of generals and solders that executed the mass genocides and set up hundreds of rape camps as recreational activities. Justice is not yet served.. (it makes me sick)      Milosevic is a war criminal and must face justice. However, justice will not be complete until ALL war criminals in that ugly Balkan conflict are caught and tried. That includes Croatians and Muslims as well, for they all have blood on their hands. The only innocents in that conflict were the civilians.      This is just another dirty game. Milosevic did the same thing in Bosnia, but at this time he was an important player and nobody mentioned his evident crimes. Hague is just an instrument to make one side black and the other white. And this is not justice. If America (or NATO) does not recognize the Hague tribunal to judge to their soldiers, why should anybody else?      May I remind those who allege an ""imbalance"" in the policy of prosecuting people before the tribunal in The Hague that there are actually Croats and Bosnian Muslims indicted -- some of them are already serving their sentences. And the late Croatian president Franjo Tudjman, whom I would consider another important suspect, is unfortunately no longer able to answer any charges. Anyway, the statement that all sides to the Balkan wars are ""equally guilty"" is highly debatable, to say the least.      Milosevic should be tried in Serbia. The Serbian People overthrew him and they deserve to find out the whole truth. Yugoslavia should be encouraged in its new changes towards democracy, i.e. not constantly being pushed into things and made to hear ultimatums which the WEST likes to serve up to achieve its goals.      I believe Milosevic must be tried in Yugoslavia first. This will enable the Yugoslavians to accept the sentences. Anything coming from an international court may be inherently perceived as that being imposed from the Western world/NATO.      Milosevic is a cunning brutal man who killed to achieve his goals. He and his ""friends"" got rich, he killed his friends when they started acting independent and so on.... Every side in the Balkan wars including Nato have committed crimes of ethnic cleansing (mass expulsion of Serbs out of Croatia and Kosovo), killing civilians and general use of terror. It is horrible but that is what happens in wars. If the west thinks it has better morals than anyone else in this world they should think again.      I see that there are many people who judge this man. I did not know why he stayed in power for so long. Clinton's era proved that the Americans can govern and bomb anywhere. I an afraid that Milosevic is only a scapegoat of his NATO allies in this labyrinth of money and power.      Milosevic killed more Serbs than anyone else! Through shady dealings with Serbian, Muslim, Croatian, and Western European counterparts, he both amassed a huge fortune and went on killing dissidents with it. Not only that, but he covertly helped (through political agreements) the powers that be cleanse 400,000 Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia! The only thing I'm afraid of is that the Serbs will say hell with the trial and string him up!      Belgrade has every right to try Slobodan Milosevic through its own criminal justice system before extraditing him to the Hague. The ICTY Prosecutor's report on the NATO bombing of Belgrade, whose purpose was to establish whether or not there was a prima facie case against NATO officers, answered this question in the negative, against overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In fact what Mr Joris does not mention is that this conclusion was as absurd as it was unfortunate and that the report has long since come in for stinging criticism from many reputable international Criminal lawyers, on account of its lop-sidedness and glaring inadequacy.      With respect to war crimes in general the matter of Henry Kissinger should take precedence over all the incidental despots like Milosevic. Since Noriega, Saddam Hussein and countless other yankee/british puppets have entered their black books, Mr Kissinger enjoys a universal immunity and a $30k speaking fee to boot. Kissinger first, then Milosevic.      Most of these comments are in favour of the West and I consider it as a great propaganda exercise! I don't support Milosevic, but neither Clinton and Tony Blair! If there is any justice in the world let's bring to justice the following criminals...Milosevic, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Sadam Hussein, Secretary of NATO! These individuals are responsible for the death of millions of innocent civilian in Yugoslavia and the Middle East.      Milosevic must first face a trial at home. It is absurd that an international tribunal (which by the way lost all credibility of ""impartiality"" when it refused to indict NATO generals for the bombing of civilian targets in Serbia) can take priority over a Serbian court trying a Serbian citizen over crimes committed in Serbia. As some have pointed out here, Milosevic is likely to lose what little support he has left when proof of corruption and abuse of power becomes more public. One way or another, he will answer for crimes that he has committed.      I think the best way out for Serbia and Mr Milosevic now is to offer him a suicide... He proved to be a loser and he lost every single battle he began, but the same goes for the UN since they couldn't get rid of the US influence and NATO as the only and sole ""judges"" of the entire world - it is their turn to be put on trial now... The UN has proved to be an international legal barrier for due protection of the interests of one part of the world.     Milosevic will be tried, but that doesn't mean justice is going to be done. By the sound of things, he's contributed much more to the overall list of war crimes than anyone ever has. With that in mind, how can he ever repay, even spending time in jail?      If The Hague prosecutes him, he'll probably be sentenced to life in the hotel-like luxury of Western jails where he will probably spend his time writing memoirs. If the Yugoslavs convict him, he is more than likely to face a firing squad or at least a life sentence in a real prison.      Imagine if the majority of the population of Texas decided that they would like independence, organising terrorist activities, slaughtering the minority and causing havoc. America would send in their forces and iron out these rebels swiftly. Could we imagine Russia and other countries joining forces and taking part in a comprehensive bombing campaign against the US to stop this ""cleansing""? I believe that the western powers, including the European countries that have traditionally been our (Serbia's) ""allies"", should be held accountable for the crimes that they have committed against a small country that has for centuries suffered and has never been given the chance to progress. Every effort should be made that the western leaders and governments pay what is needed to rebuild our country. The Serbian people have always been the victims of western tyranny and hidden political agendas. They twisted our arm and we failed to get down on our knees and beg. Mr Milosevic did the right thing in defending his people, their pride and our national interest, which is no one's business.      I see that there are many people who judge this man. I did not know why he stayed in power for so long. Clinton' s era proved that the Americans can govern and bomb anywhere. I an afraid that Milosevic is only a scapegoat of his Nato allies in this labyrinth of money and power.      If the Hague prosecutes him, he'll probably be sentenced to life in the hotel-like luxury of Western jails where he will probably spend his time writing memoirs. If the Yugoslavs convict him, he is more than likely to face a firing squad or at least a life sentence in a real prison.      A dose of Slavic justice at the hands of his fellow countrymen is going to be more severe than the ""the Hague"".      We cannot say that justice will be done in this case. Who is just to judge Milosevic? Why is his case different from others? There are so many African leaders who have committed serious war crimes, human rights violations, and even persecuted their own people yet the international community support them for selfish reasons. If Milosevic's case is a sign that the international community is up to the task to take serious measures against dictators around the world then I will suggest that Milosevic should be judged in the war crimes Tribunal at the Hague rather than his native Yougoslavia to ensure some sort of judicial neutrality and legitimacy to his case.      He should stand trial, and Robert Mugabe with him. What frustrates me is that these tyrants seem to walk away - not only unpunished, but wealthier after exploiting their subjects. In a world where basic conversation is stifled by political correctness, how can these people get away with the kind of behaviour that we dare not even talk about?      Milosevic is unlikely to get a fair hearing wherever he is tried. However, The Hague would seem to be the fairest in the eyes of his victims, whereas a trial in Belgrade would not be.      I definitely think that he should be handed over to face charges. If he doesn't many more will follow in his footsteps thinking that they too can get away with 'murder'.      Yes, justice will be done. This man will have to stand before God one day.      If Milosevic gets handed over to the International War Crimes Tribunal so should Blair, Clinton, Cook, ...      Its time that the public learnt more about the true nature of The Hague Tribunal. This organ created by the Security Council is sinister in its operation. It receives funds from private sources, uses no jury, refuses to even investigate Nato war crimes committed in 1998, and does not have authority over any government despite the oft-repeated implication that it does. No country has any 'right' to impose selective 'justice' on other nations while excluding themselves from that same obligation. To do so is not justice but another form of imperialism.      It amazes me that the international community is so fixated on Milosovic. I doubt if he ever pulled the trigger of a gun, however it is a matter of record that hundreds of thousands of Serb paramilitary, police, soldiers and other thugs raped, murdered, tortured, and destroyed the lives of Kosovars, Bosnians, and Croats. These vermin are now living ""peaceful"" lives in Serbia. They should be held accountable for the many lives they destroyed - not only Milosovic.      Let Milosevic be judged by his own people. Even his supporters will have to admit that he was living in luxury when his people were starving. Let them see that his son Marco was living like a playboy when other young men were being killed. Hopefully more criminals will be prosecuted after that, not only Serbs, but also Croats, Bosnians and Kosovars...      The idea of an international tribunal which is able to try known rights violators must be a very good one indeed. However, when such a tribunal becomes deliberately selective in its functions, then it automatically looses its legitimacy. Why is Milosevich considered more monstrous than Henry Kissinger, or indeed, Margaret Thatcher?      You should understand the Balkans before you judge its leaders, people or customs. I see some ""experts"" here have spent a ""whole"" three years there and can tell you what happened. The rest know because CNN said so. The enemy is clearly identified as those who don't chew a burger and wear a baseball hat. Believe me the propaganda I've seen under a Communist government is nothing comparing to what I've seen in US. I guess it is so easy to judge because the highly developed NATO countries have completely overcome their ethnic problems. Don't you feel the Basques in Spain, the Irish in GB, the Kurds in Turkey, (sorry if I missed somebody) are under control just because CIA doesn't send them money.      Of course justice can be done without going to the Hague. If the penalty in Yugoslavia results in the death penalty, then that will be justice.      Repeat a lie enough times and it will become truth. And so the west continues to repeat its many lies. ""Milosevic started and lost four wars"".... Really? So who won? I can't see any winners. And how did he start it? By prematurely recognising Croatia and Bosnia? And what was to happen to the Serbs living in these newly formed nationalist countries? ""Milosevic is solely responsible for the consequences in Kosovo""... So the West can bomb civilians, hospitals, TV stations, bridges, houses, factories and pollute a country and blame all of that on Milosevic. To me, it seems that the Serbs are not the only ones who need to come to terms with their actions in the former Yugoslavia.      The most scary thing for me was that most Serbs considered themselves victims and did not think Serbia under Milosovic was a heinous aggressor. Whilst it is to be hoped that the International War Crimes Tribunal will deal with the many other individual and state criminal incidents, Serbia as a state must accept that it has a case to answer. The responses on your programme strongly suggest that the Balkan problem is going to rear its ugly head yet again, maybe in ten, twenty, fifty years time. Real scary.      I do not completely agree with Peter Adams, UK and some others. They say that Nato bombed a sovereign country!! Nato is an alliance and everybody agreed to bomb a country that committed crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo and killed innocent unarmed children.      After reading the emails you have posted on Slobodan Milosevic, I am amazed on how everyone can point fingers at so many, and not just say, ""What could I have done to help?"". Should we all continue to blame each other, or should we try to rise above all of this. We must as people of this world reach out to one another and find the truth. Slobodan Milosevic should indeed be held for war crimes, so we may learn these truths.      Who cares where he's in jail? As long as he does the time for the crime.      I don't think that the public can decide what is next for the ex-Yugoslav leader. I think that the question implies that European civilians have a say in what becomes of the man. In my opinion prison is where he belongs, and nobody can change that. Asking the public what they think is next for Milosevic is a pointless gesture. The courts will decide where he goes from here. Frankly he deserves to remain in prison for the rest of his life.      Milosevic = Hitler, both killed millions of innocent people. Both did racial war. Milosevic is a THIEF (stole money and gold from its own country), a LIAR (lied about election), a TERRORIST (killed over a million people in Balkans), and a DICTATOR (killed even his own army generals like Arkan). Milosevic has blood in his hands. One mad Milosevic massacred one million innocent women and children. Sending him to jail is just too little.      It is unfortunate that Mr Murphy is living in the Twilight Zone. I worked for the UN in that part of the world for five years, and anyone who was there, be they UN or Nato troops knew who was responsible for the terrible atrocities that went on. A lot of people died because of nationalism.     In response to a statement by your guest, there is no ""principle of proportionality"" contained in the laws governing war crimes. The Nato bombing targeted the civilian infrastructure of Yugoslavia, adopting a tactic first used by the United States against Iraq. In one instance, among others, a chemical factory was destroyed, resulting in long-term damage to the health of the civilian population in that area. While I have no brief for Milosevic, this is clearly a political trial.      Why on earth is the War Crimes Tribunal in such a hurry? Let the Yugoslavs destroy his reputation in his own country first with corruption charges then when he is charged in The Hague he will have lost most of his support which could otherwise cause serious trouble. After all they are still charging world war criminals sixty years after the event.      With the rise of nationalism in the former Yugoslavia during the eighties many (not all) Croats, Serbs, Bosnian Muslims and Albanians wanted (and still want) to create their own countries along ethnic lines. Those who killed and are still killing to pursue this goal are equally guilty of crimes against humanity.      Bringing Milosevic to trial is definitely an important thing. But there is one thing that is hardly ever talked about: The collective responsibility (not guilt) of the Serb people for what happened. After all, as one writer correctly stated, the majority of Serbs were behind Milosevic and the wars he started for over a decade. The popular movement that overthrew the dictator last autumn wasn't there when Serbs murdered and ethnically cleansed tens of thousands of innocent people in places like Sarajevo and Srebenica. When will Serb intellectuals start contemplating what is in their national psyche that made an entire people run amok?      I just want to correct certain Boris from Serbia here. It is nonsense that Milosevic gained any support due to his arrest. On the contrary, about 60% of the people, according to the surveys taken, are strongly looking forward to seeing him tried first and foremost for the misery he brought to Serbia. As for Milsoevic ever playing again any kind of political role it is another unreality which is believed only by the very few of his supporters whose approximate age is 70-80. Neither they have future, nor their hero has one, except behind bars.      Milosevic is no worse than any other world leader who is responsible for the death of others. Whether it be the US and Britain in the Gulf/ Balkans, the British in Northern Ireland or the Russians in Chechnya. Serbia needs to decide the fate of Milosevic and not the rest of the world.      Is the Hague tribunal any more than a kangaroo court constituted by the western powers to be manipulated as an instrument of their foreign policy? Would it not be right to say that the judge, jury and the prosecutor are all rolled into one in the Hague tribuna K    One of the problems with the Balkans, as far as I can see, is that there seems to be a true inability for countries to come to terms with their past. The wars in Croatia and Bosnia were still fuelled by ""unsolved business"" from the Second World War (and futher back...). This has to end. By putting Milosevic on trial, the Serbian people will be making the brave and difficult move of facing their own past, which they are determined to put it behind them. This is something that has rarely been done in the Balkans, and this could mark a great step forward for the future of both Serbia and the Balkans as a whole. Hopefully it will encourage neighbouring countries to do the same.      With the ICTY being established, staffed and funded by the same NATO countries that involved themselves in the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, the ensuing civil wars and the illegal bombardment of the current Yugoslavia, there is no question of Milosevic ever receiving a fair trail in The Hague. A key point to remember is that we are not talking about the World Court in The Hague, but a special-purpose tribunal conveniently located in the same city. If we were talking about the World Court or at least a permanent war crimes court applicable to all countries, there would be no opposition from Serbs to Milosevic's extradition. The difference between the two is more than semantic as this current tribunal conveniently dispenses with sections of the UN Charter dealing with crimes against peace, the greatest war crime of all. For the record, Yugoslavia was (even under Milosevic), and remains, an enthusiastic supporter of the establishment of a permanent war crimes court. Unfortunately the Americans are persistent in their refusal, citing concerns about the potential political nature of such trials.      I was quite shocked to read some of the comments in this debate and the ignorance that actually surround this man's atrocities. As a British Soldier I have spent nearly 3 years on duty the Balkans. I have seen first hand the barbarity, suffering and atrocities committed in the name of Milosevic. The Serbian people deserve a fresh start on the world stage, lets hope that this is the beginning of the end to another horrible chapter in European history.      Go on and tell the mothers of victims in Bosnia and Kosova that Milosevic will be tried for corruption!! This is just not right. As an Albanian I have always tried not to generalise the Serbian war as the war of the entire Serbian nation but as the war of Milosevic. By seeing these comments above I am starting to think that he was just realising what his nation wanted. To destroy every neighbour's peace and stability. He was a madman! And everyone agreeing with him is too.      Your comments before we went ON AIR      Milosevic is not a good-hearted person but in my opinion the one who should go to the war crimes tribunal is ex-president Clinton. He saw no problem in murdering hundreds of innocent people, destroying a quarter of the country and probably polluting many places with radioactive materials. Of course there is no question of him compensating all the innocent victims.      Justice can be done only if Russia, China and India will establish The International War Crimes Tribunal II to bring Nato criminals to justice also.      Many comments that I read here from Serbs echo the same sense of ""victimhood"" that Milosevic rhetorically used to deceive the Serbian people. Serbia and Milosevic started all four of the Balkan wars. They were the aggressors. They bear the lion's share of responsibility for the atrocities committed. But they have been reluctant to accept blame and move on as the Germans have done after World War II. The only way for the Serbian people to accept these hard truths after being lied to for 13 years by Milosevic is to try him and all indictees for war crimes. It is only then that they can truly reconcile and have peace with their neighbours.      It is important that Milosevic does not become a martyr in the eyes of Serbs. Let him be exposed as a thief, liar, and assassin in a Serbian court first. Let him answer to his own people and afterwards it will be much easier to extradite him to The Hague. What is the rush anyway? He is only 55 and in good health.      If Yugoslavia sends Milosevic to the Hague it will only serve the West's interest, that is sweeping away their guilt of the Nato attack on Yugoslavia in 1999 and their present inaction towards ongoing Albanian nationalism which is based in ""Nato-controlled"" Kosovo.      When are we going to see someone stand trial for the crimes committed against the Serbs of Croatia, Bosnia AND Yugoslavia? Tens of thousands perished in the civil war(s), yet no-one seems to have murdered them. Did they commit mass suicide? No justice until ALL culprits are brought to court - and I don't mean The Hague. Let the Balkanites deal with their own villains.      Milosevic even if he is tried by the court in the Hague will have far more choice and freedom than the hundreds of thousands who were put to death on his orders. It exposes the fallacy of opponents of the death penalty that such a man - a war criminal - responsible for 1/4 million deaths and the rape of thousands of women will as the worst possible punishment get a life sentence and get to remain on this earth when he denied this to so many innocents. Where is the justice?      Milosevic lost every war he embarked on. Milosevic always broke his promises. Milosevic also proved himself a coward. He was bluffing when he claimed that he would not be arrested alive, which he was. Milosevic is a war criminal, a coward and a loser. I have very little sympathy for this man. I hope he'll be judged in The Hague because that would send a very strong signal to present and future tyrants.      Reading all these comments, I noticed how many people are under influence of US and UK media, which constantly serves an incorrect story about Serbia and its people. This man is not guilty! We voted for him for 13 years. That means that over 50% of the nation agreed with the things he did. He did the best he could to save our people in the rest of the republics of former Yugoslavia. After all, it must be said that both in Croatia and Bosnia lived Serbs with native people. In Croatia there were about 2.000.000 Serbs and in Bosnia much more. These Serbs are refugees now! While running away from Croatian forces they were bombed. Is that justice? This arrest is a big mistake. Remember that history is written by the ones who won. Like in the case of Vietnam, through decades it will be proven he was not wrong. It must be said that since this shameful arrest, he has gained support in Serbia. Like it or not, he will, probably be president again. If he would be the worst man in the world, we would not send him to The Hague.      When I read Sean Murphy's posting, I realised that Orwell was right. Freedom is slavery, justice is injustice, and black is white.      The Hague and the West talk about Yugoslavia's obligation to hand over Milosevic as part of international law, but where was the international law when Nato was bombing Yugoslavia illegally? I think it is weak for the West, Nato and other parties to attempt to blame all the suffering in the former Yugoslavia on Milosevic himself. It somehow tries to take the blame away for their own brutality.      History has proved that only injustice is applied by the victors to the losers. The Hague war crimes tribunal is nothing more or less than a reincarnation of Nuremberg and the unjust show trials of the Stalin era. The real guilty perpetrators here are the ones who are demanding that Slobodan Milosevic stand trial.      There is nothing that can be done that will ever fully punish this man for his crimes. Atonement is not possible and if there is some higher being with the power to put right the harm that has been done then that is our only hope      Milosevic must be tried in Yugoslavia first and must also be held accountable to the War Crimes Tribunal. Milosevic as he often claimed was quite rightly democratically elected and as a result of this he must be held accountable for his actions. He is therefore responsible to the people he governed. The people of the Yugoslav Federation must begin the process of reconciliation and must begin to understand the depth of Milosevic's brutality.      The man is a tyrant, and deserves to be punished indefinitely for his crimes. He will not get a fair trial, but this is fine, because he was not a fair person. What comes around, goes around.      Was it only Croats, Muslims and Albanians that suffered during these horrible wars? No! Thousands of Serbs were killed too, by Nato, Croatian, Muslim and Albanian leaders. For justice to be done Milosevic should be tried for his crimes, but only if other leaders who are just as guilty as him, are brought to justice too.      I don't know whether Slobodan Milosevic should be tried in Serbia or the Hague. Either way, I know that he and his accomplices will perhaps never endure the suffering that millions of people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo endured at the hand of their cruel political ideas. The actual physical hurt may have ended in Bosnia in 1995 but the mental hurt is still there and will be present for generations to come.      Let's stop for a moment and remember what led to Nato's immediate intervention in the Balkans. Many lives were saved. Milosevic's trial at The Hague is a continuity of such action.      Milosevic has to go immediately to The Hague. He is responsible for the troubles of the Balkans, including the Serb majority because they gave him their vote and a mandate freely to commit genocide on the peoples of the Balkans.      The arrest of Slobodan Milosevic is a good first step in the long process of bringing him to justice for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Balkans. However, the international community must not relent as there are still other hardened war criminals out there masquerading as democratic leaders. In the long run, the world will be a better place when the Permanent International Criminal Court becomes fully operational.      Justice will only be done when all sides responsible for violence and crimes in the former Yugoslavia, not only Milosevic, face The Hague Tribunal.      It is ridiculous to talk about ""justice is being done"" in the cases like Milosevic. The justice will never be done, at least not in the form of life that we know about. He couldn't have possibly managed all those crimes against humanity and four wars in the region on his own either. He has got many accomplices and he is not the only master minder. As for what he has done to Serbs, well, they voted for him and followed him in great numbers, so they deserved him.      Reading the responses it is clear that opinions are totally polarised, which indicates that an unbiased trial would be impossible in Yugoslavia. The Hague seems the best place for the trial but with minimal or no US involvement since this is clearly a provocation. The jury could be chosen by the defence solicitors from a list of judges and magistrates from democracies around the world.      Two things that must be avoided are allowing Milosevic to become a martyr will only strengthen the divisions, and allowing delays in the trial taking place. Uniting the region will take at least a generation but the sooner the process begins, the sooner Yugoslavia can find a permanent solution for herself.      As a matter of fact justice must be done, but why only Milosevic? Just go back to the past and think about Hiroshima and Nagasaki and then think about Vietnam. What about the Middle East and Israel? Actually this word ""justice"" has been so much exploited by the US and western world that it has lost its real meaning.They always use this word to fulfil their own purposes and motives otherwise they are not interested whatever is happening with a weaker nation.      So far , we have not yet seen any dictator or someone from a comparable level in prison in recent years. Several have tried to bring Pinochet to justice, but he will probably die from old age before he receives just punishment. The international community now has the duty to demand Milosevic to be tried in the Hague. Especially the U.S. should push this process, as I don't see the EU capable off putting enough pressure in a joint effort. If this dictator cannot be pushed to appear in the Hague , I don't see anyone can ever in the future.      Definitely justice will be done. But why has Milosevic alone been arrested? There are numerous war criminals and terrorist in this world, I do not know why the Bush government is interested in Milosevic's case alone. I felt very bad and ashamed of the Yugoslavian government because for want of money they are handing over their prestige to the American government. Why can't they try him in their own court. Is there no law at Yugoslavia? Will the Bush government arrest Sharon, Yasar and Osama?      Why are people criticising the US for it's intervention in the Balkans? There is not a country in the world that comes close to the US in terms of economic power, military might, and over all world influence! Without the US asserting its power around the world, criminals like Milosevic would be free to act in whatever way he wants.      Slobodan Milosevic should be held accountable for his actions in the wars in the Balkans and his programmes of ethnic cleansing against Albanians, Muslim Bosnians, and Croatians. It would be preferable for him to be tried in Yugoslavia because the only gain for trial being held in the Hague would be a political victory for some in the West. It is plausible that his own citizens can render proper justice in a Yugoslavian court.      Justice certainly won't be done in The Hague. For justice to be done, there has to be a fair trial, and the chances of that happening are nil. It's enough to read the comments on this Talking Point to see that practically everyone has already decided the man is guilty of everything NATO, US and EU politicians and media have accused him of. A karmic justice might be achieved if Clinton, Albright, Blair, Cook, Solana, Robertson, etc, etc were to be extradited to Belgrade to face the Serbs' accusations of war crimes. Eventually he will probably be extradited to The Hague, the main purpose of which is to sentence him quickly to silence him - hopefully not before he has been allowed to spill the beans on the roles of Clinton, Blair, Albright etc, so that we get the opportunity to hear more about them.      No other country has problems except Yugoslavia? The tragedy is great on all sides. Believe me there is no innocents in the Balkan conflicts. Be sure you have seen all the proof there is before judgement is placed on any nation or person. But Milosevic is guilty, because the nation that suffered the most is the one he ruled, and that is where he should be tried! Next to him should sit NATO, who thought breaking the UN rules and attacking a sovereign nation, with some collateral damage, is fine if they feel like it. Keep all your money and help your own nations. There is no nation without internal issues, and hence they shouldn't try to clean up anybody else's kitchen. Especially if that nation is built up on exploiting other nations, colonies, and/or commiting genocide on the native population.      I am strongly in favour of non-extradition. I believe that there can be no fair trial of any person on the world stage, let alone the fair trial of someone who has already been convicted in the world press. If Yugoslavia is to be accepted in the world then we should start by accepting their judgement in the matter of the trial of Mr. Milosevic.      Not only Milosevic but all politicians who committed crime should be tried and punished. Western countries and politicians too abuse power and always act as if they are above the law. There should be no one above the law including the UN. The US cannot act as a big brother. Will US politicians stand trail for crimes committed in other countries? For example shooting down an Iranian passenger aircraft, NATO bombing etc. If there is a policy it should apply to everyone. Otherwise there is no democracy, no justice.      No question that Milosevic should be tried. He is guilty of so many crimes that it would be pointless to debate about them. However, the only reason for the western governments demanding to see him in the Hague, is not because they like seeing justice done but because if Milosevic went to the Hague, they can blame the whole mess solely on him and therefore justify the NATO bombing of Serbia. In any war, and in politics in general, there are no black and white things. All is grey and too complicated. Everyone is a bad guy. We can't single out one man or one nation to be the only guilty party.      I think that there can be no comparison between Milosovic's actions and that of NATO during the Balkans campaign. NATO acted with the intention of bringing peace, that isn't easy to do. To say Milosovic acted in the interests of peace is ludicrous. Over the years various war criminals have been arrested or killed resisting arrest and its nice to see that there is some justice in the world. The next step is to bring him to the Hague to answer for the atrocities he ordered, after all if he is not guilty why should he fear it?      Yes, justice will be done, but not completely. Milosevic will be tried - in Serbia - and in all probability convicted for gross corruption and election fraud. His major crimes, however, of fomenting war and genocide, and creating international instability, will go unpunished, for three reasons. First, President Kostunica will never agree to Milosevic's extradition. He is not much of an improvement as a president, being a fanatical Serb nationalist and will be reluctant to risk alienating future voters by sending a fellow Serb to The Hague.      Second, there are still many people at the top echelons of Serb society who, whatever their actions in last October's revolution, actively colluded with Milosevic in his crimes. Finally, there is still not enough vigour in prosecuting war crimes at The Hague, for the simple reason that diplomats and politicians everywhere are nervous of setting precedents of bringing other politicians to book that could rebound on them in the future.      I wonder if ""justice"" is a proper word. I think now that Albanian terrorists are invading Macedonia it should be 100%clear to everybody who Milosevic was fighting two years ago in Kosovo. It will be the biggest hypocrisy in the recent history to judge the man who just did what he was supposed to - he defended his people from being exterminated by terrorists. Yes, Miloshevic is a communist, and if he did anything wrong, he should be judged by Yugoslavian laws, not by US ones.      He should be tried for crimes against the state first. That should be Serbia's right, no matter how distasteful and insulting other people find it. He committed crimes against his own people as well. He should serve whatever sentence they deem fit for him. As for the War Crimes court in The Hague, they have a long memory and an awful lot of patience, they've demonstrated this with WWII Nazi war criminals. They're not going anywhere, they'll bide their time for as long as it takes if necessary. However, I am totally against some western nations threatening sanctions if he's not handed over. You cannot blackmail a sovereign country into handing over a native of that country even if he is Milosevic.      I think it's shocking how so many can write in on Talking Point and defend Milosevic. Let us not forget what this man and his regime has done over the years, causing untold suffering and persecution on thousands of people. I defy anyone reading this to justify how the rape, torture and murder by those in power can ever be acceptable (If you don't think that this is a black-and-white situation, place yourself in the position of the person being tortured, just for a moment and try and 'see the bigger picture' then [re:Gordon Martin's comments]. "
HOC HOC-KW -0.14 " I would like to see a teacher initiate the first collective civil case to evict a child from a class on the grounds that this person is denying the others the right to a ""fair and decent education"". I am absolutely certain that the education of the innocent children can be protected under the European Law on Human Rights. Please, please, please let us see the teaching profession get some redress through this legal right.      However regrettable the details of this case may be, we can't afford to treat allegations of this kind with anything less than 100% seriousness. The real scandal is not that the false allegations were made (until the conviction rate in the courts hits 100% false allegations are a fact of life), but that it took 18 months to settle the affair. We need a much more efficient tribunal system. Naturally it would help if more parents at least gave an impression of caring when their children behave like monsters. I have two young children, who are not angels by any means, but I have been horrified by some behaviour exhibited by their peers. Their parents sit idly by and watch them destroy play equipment and intimidate other children, but they resent any attempt by other parents (and presumably by teachers) to control this behaviour. Of course, it is inconceivable that twenty years of systematic undermining of the teaching profession by the previous government could have anything to do with this parlous state of affairs.      See what happens when you blindly imitate the worst ideas from across the Pond? Why couldn't you learn from our mistakes before repeating it yourselves? Surely if we learned nothing else, we should have learned from Sen. McCarthy that witch-hunts NEVER protect the people they purport to protect, they always leave ruined innocent lives in their wake. The witch-hunt against child-abuse (of all kinds) is no different.      Yes, there are too many false accusations against teachers. I know of one who was falsely accused of sexual harassment, and the apparent lack of support from the education authority was frankly shocking. Whilst we must be careful to protect children, we cannot allow excellent teachers to be hounded from the profession by children seeking notoriety amongst their peers and education authorities who consider themselves above the law.      I looked into becoming a teacher after I finished my degree, it has always been one of the things I wanted to do. However I was not able to as the degree I have (Archaeology BSc) is not subject on the national curriculum. So I tried to apply for a History PGCE, only to be told I needed a history degree (I felt I already had this in effect because you can't do archaeology successfully without knowing some history). Anyway the upshot is I'm very glad I didn't get into the profession with the way things are at the moment.      Children need discipline and are clearly not getting it at home these days. For all the ""do gooders"" say, fear of punishment usually has a deterrent effect and at least make children think before they misbehave and I'm sure we've all met children who could do with more discipline.      Teachers cannot teach without the means to bring pupils to the point where they can learn and sometimes it takes a while before those pupils realise they want to learn. You wouldn't send a lion tamer into the ring without a chair, would you?      Child protection legislation has gone way too far. Children need caring for, but also need to know what is right and wrong. Sometimes, as the last resort the cane (with full accountability) is the only way of enforcing rules. This woman should never have needed to go to court.      It is a sad fact of life that children will spread malicious rumours about their friends. What chance to teachers have when they are disliked by the students.      I strongly agree that Marjorie's accusers should be prosecuted for libel and slander. Also, Marjorie should press for compensation and damages as well. Besides, for some kids there is nothing like good slapping especially when all other means are exhausted. As for the child protection laws, the legislation in this area has gone too far to the ludicrous point where we cannot effectively protect our property and personal safety from wily teenagers. If this legislation is not amended or withdrawn large parts of this country are going to be unsafe.      To all the whinging teachers - get another job! Teaching has got to be the worst stressful job on earth. Only when schools are running 2 days a week will anything be done. Teachers deserve a minimum of #40,000 a year, plus video cameras in classrooms. Parents and children should be forced to sign a contract that binds them and their children to a three-strikes-and-you're-expelled rule.      Placing cameras in classrooms is the only viable solution that I can see. For one thing, they could be used to speed up cases like that of Ms Evans - if a camera had been placed in her classroom, her case would have been sorted out within a month or two. Classroom cameras could also be used to prove to parents that their darling children do misbehave occasionally. Once this is done, thdey can then be disciplined properly. The right of a group of children to learn is more important than the right of one individual child to privacy, if that privacy has the potential to disrupt the education of the whole group.      Who has been abused in this case? Mrs Evans. The accused. As is usually the case. Children can and do lie. And their parents encourage them.      The answer lies in cameras in the classrooms. The resulting films can be used as teacher training tools, for proof to parents and school boards of disruptive student behaviour, and to protect both students and teachers from student and teacher violence.      Being a student, I probably don't realise the full extent of what it means to be a teacher. But I can say from personal experience that they form such an integral part of society that they have to be treated with respect. Children have to be taught to do so at home. I think the education system has to place more a little more faith in the teacher and I hope not resort to something that treats them as they are kids by employing cameras in classrooms. The system has to step in somewhere to protect teachers too.      Tanya from USA should note. In the past when a child would earn a clip round the ear for ""being cheeky"" - never mind anything more serious, behavioural standards were much higher than they are now. In the current excuse for society a violent criminal can sue a police officer who restrains them, a child can destroy a teacher's reputation even when no wrong has been done, and behavioural standards can scarcely get much lower. I'm glad you are so sure that you are ""right"" - never mind that the evidence from most of the ""civilised"" world suggests the exact opposite.      I think that it is really sad to see many people asking for corporal punishment to be brought back. A very important point that no one has mentioned is ""the role of the teacher""! Teachers are not in classrooms to punish children, nor to discipline them. Teachers are there to show children the way to knowledge, to guide them. All humans have the inner drive to find knowledge, this is a fact, or we all would still be living in caves! Let's turn this whole problem around and look at the way teachers are trying to educate, with their punishments, authoritarian attitudes and punishment methods! Try to start inspiring the child, capture his interest and there is your answer to discipline in the classroom. I am a Montessori teacher who loves going to work every day, I have a class of 25 children aged between 9-12. I have never hit any of the children, if they are unconcentrated in the classroom it is usually me who hasn't inspired them to work.      Teaching is the profession of professions. This noble profession is believed to be as holy as preaching and most probably for this reason we had honourable prophets who are regarded as high as super human. Now the teachers, parents and the elders must be considered as highly respectable people of our society. There may be some black sheep in every field. But in case, a particular number of teachers are immoral or unmannered or almost untrained for the purpose. As the accusation goes against the teacher Marjorie Evans, her matter might have been taken secretly by a secret tribunal or special court so that it could not be so much publicised. Also a very few number of people with the proficiency of teaching may adopt the teaching profession since excellent teachers have always been in shortage in every community. I am afraid what will happen with the building up of nations with enormous personality-wealth-fame - scarcity which has been the case here for a long time !      There is one answer to this problem. Bad parenting in many but not all families. Teachers are there to educate, it is the parents who have failed, not the child.      Once again a teacher is punished by having their life turned into hell for eighteen months. Let's not kid ourselves, some teachers will commit 'criminal acts' in relation to the children they teach. But there needs to be a mechanism that punishes the accuser if the courts find the accusation is malicious and unfounded.      On the subject of fair punishments in schools, I'd like to take up Helen's point about her class being kept in detention for a week due to the actions of one boy. No, because one teacher didn't do his or her job properly. If the boy was naughty, he should have been punished, not the whole class, They are not responsible for his behaviour. Whatever the merits of corporal punishment, whole class punishments are an obvious injustice and only serve to sour the relationship between teacher and class.      I agree that people who work with children are too vulnerable to false accusations. Children are very impressionable and often get the wrong ideas of what is and is not abuse. Any allegations made by a child against an adult who cares for them must be thoroughly investigated before charges are brought. After all, doesn't a fair and free justice system believe in innocence until proven guilty? The burden of proof should be on the child who comes forth with the accusations, not on the person trying to protest their innocence.      My mother was a teacher from the 1950's to the 1980's. During the mid 1970's she saw that her authority as a teacher was being diminished. When she was assaulted by a pupil in the school, the child was considered only ""emotionally unstable"" - not the thug he really was - and nothing was done! Yet if my mother had taken steps to restrain him, she would have been accused of assault. We now have a situation where if a child chooses to misbehave in class he can do so - after all no teacher is allowed to touch him nowadays, let alone give him the thick ear he deserves.      It used to be the case that any accusation by a child was routinely dismissed, since children were held to be incapable of understanding the seriousness of what they said. That led to some adults getting away with a fair amount of real abuse, sexual and physical. We seem to have swung a bit too far the other way, and careers are being ruined because of accusations that are never properly verified. We need to be somewhere in the middle, where a child's accusation is listened to and investigated, but those accused still have to be protected by a presumption of innocence.      Of course teachers are too vulnerable. Especially badly-behaved children from disreputable homes are very capable of lying, and of threatening teachers, particularly female teachers; they are often egged on by their parents. Teachers have too little powers of discipline because no form of corporal punishment is allowed. This is all due to silly 'child-centred learning'.      As a teacher such a question becomes rhetorical. Considering that some kids come from homes with little or no parental discipline they usually mistake discipline for maltreatment. However, there are also black sheep in the teachers folk who truly, callously and wickedly maltreat students.      I am a teacher and I would be very happy to have cameras in the classroom. This would help to protect both the students and the teachers. It would also allow the teachers to let the parents of some of the students see how their children behave in school. Currently, teachers can do very little to discipline students and disruptive, disinterested students can poison the learning environment for those students who would like to learn.      The only thing children learn from being hit (call it a ""clip round the ear"" if you like, but it's still being hit) is that you can get your own way if you use violence. Show me the evidence that suggests physical pain helps with understanding your responsibilities and I'll give up my ""do gooder"" membership. I'd rather be ""good"" and ""correct"" than ""bad"" and ""wrong"".      I personally know many teachers, myself included, who have left the profession because of the intolerable stress. I was an 'excellent' teacher by Ofsted standards, and, more importantly, by the parents' and by my own standards. But management inefficiencies and other problems led to my long protracted illness brought on by extreme stress. Many, as I said, have left because of the outrageous pressures. What do I do now? Nothing, after 4 years I am still unable to work.      Strange how now we have comments about how difficult teachers' jobs are given the poor behaviour of children, but when it comes to discussing a pay rise, the comments were about whinging teachers getting into the real world. I'm glad that the hard work that I put into my job is being recognised.      All kids are well capable of telling lies that cause trouble for adults. If it's grassing up Mum to Granny for not handing over enough pocket money, we all laugh. The problem is that such antics can land people such as teachers in really hot water. If on the other hand we discount all complaints by children, we place the genuinely vulnerable in potentially mortal peril. How can we separate fact from fiction? How about video cameras in classrooms? It sounds a bit extreme, but it all comes down to how seriously society decides to treat this issue.      Raising your voice can be very useful when attempting to gain control of a situation which has got out of hand. Often it is the only way teachers can make students pay attention! Surely preventing it will only lead to an increased number of frustrated teachers and excluded pupils as teachers will find it even more difficult to control a difficult class through no fault of their own?      A head teacher gets hauled through the courts due to false allegations from a pupil. There is something seriously wrong going on here. Personally I never did see the point of banning corporal punishment in schools. The ban is a fine demonstration of how much damage political correctness can cause. An entire generation has never been taught responsibility for their actions, and that's a real shame.      I attended a primary school on a council estate and there was one teacher who always seemed to get the worst behaved children in her class. She never raised her voice, she never threatened. She was polite and considerate, and she expected her class to treat her - and each other - in the same way. They left her class at the end of the year like lambs. She was a wonderful teacher who proved that you don't need to use violence to gain respect and attention.      Rob is correct, children have been taught their rights but not their responsibilities. The trendy education methods have over the years removed any semblance of respect for teachers and adults generally. We have a generation of yobs that have been produced by a generation of yobs. No wonder nobody wants to be a teacher.      There appears no deterrent to people who falsely accuse - whether it is a pupil accusing a teacher over ""violence"", a patient accusing a doctor over ""misconduct"", or a woman accusing a man over ""rape"". With all of these cases, there must be something that the party wrongly accused can get redress, and for the perpetrator to be rightly punished. From the days of witch-hunting, nothing has changed - the accuser always appears to have more weight in the eyes of the law and the press, than the accused. This must stop as this injustice shows acute naivety of our legal system in relation to humankind (i.e. the law cannot understand that many people lie to achieve their aims).      There is a difficult balance that has to be struck between protecting children from real abuse and giving the teacher the human right not to be punished or penalised in any way until proven guilty. I hope anyone who has made a false accusation has time in adulthood to reflect on the damage they have caused - not only to the innocent teacher, but to future generations of abused children who may no longer be given the credibility they deserve.      Anyone working with children nowadays has no power of discipline over the children whatsoever, thanks to ""politically-correct"" do-gooders, and parents failing in their responsibility to instil discipline into their children from birth! I abhor child abuse, but a ""clip around the ear"" never did me any harm!      So - a child can disrupt lessons and the teacher can do nothing. The child can be verbally aggressive and the teacher can do nothing. The child can be physically aggressive if not violent, and the teacher can do nothing. If the teacher attempts to prevent the little darling ""expressing itself"" all hell breaks loose. If the child makes an allegation, even if it has no basis whatsoever in fact, the teacher is suspended and faces one inquiry after another. When finally found innocent the teacher's name has been dragged through the mud and the child isn't even named. That sounds fair, given the standards of this Government.      Teachers are in an impossible position of being expected to discipline other people's children without either upsetting the children or being seen to threaten the position of authority parents like to believe they occupy in the minds of their offspring (even though many prove unwilling or incapable of living up to this image). Marjorie Evans, like many many other teachers, has been the victim of a witch-hunt. Teachers' careers, reputations and lives should not be held in the balance by the petty machinations and resentments of those whose shortcomings they are expected to compensate for. Unfortunately, because of this country's warped and bitter attitude to the teaching profession, this is precisely what is happening in schools of all sizes across the country, and particularly in primary schools and in small ""neighbourhood"" communities.      Children's complaints should be taken seriously but lets have enquiries carried out in private. The big problem we have now is that teachers endure 'trial by media' and are usually branded guilty by just an accusation.      Somehow our common sense is not playing an expected role in our society. The legal battle was unnecessary; it actually disgraced itself by revealing its weakness and ineffective system clearly.      Bring back the cane! I am saying this as a number of teenagers and young adults don't want to go into teaching. It is not just the low salaries, but most of us had classes with one or two characters that spoil the rest of the class. When I was in year 8, the whole of my form was put onto class detention for a week due to one immature little boy. Detentions don't punish the ones in trouble nor does excluding them as I see them going to town etc. Teachers should be exempted from smacking laws      They said corporal punishment was too extreme for disciplining naughty children, so they banned it - fair enough. They then said that physical contact with naughty children should be banned, like flicking them around the ear etc, so they did that too. Now, they say shouting and raising your voice is too extreme for disciplining naughty children. Is this pushing the boat out a little too far? I think so. I mean, what are they going to say next? Perhaps they will ban direct communication between the child and teacher altogether. Maybe the teacher will just appear on a big TV screen in front of them offering the children no interaction whatsoever.      As a foreign student first in Britain and second France and coming from one of the least developed countries, I think your child protection laws have gone too far! The teacher no longer seems to have any control over pupils. Children generally tell lies to attract attention. In Africa the teacher who is entrusted with the education and discipline of children has the final say not the child and needless to say of course African children are better behaved in spite of the poverty.      I was a teacher for five years before I left to pursue another career. In my time as a teacher I was verbally abused by one child or another nearly every day. On a few occasions I was physically abused by an out-of-control child, and what could I do about it? Nothing, apart from tell the child not to do it, and then if this was ignored, to tell them not to do it again. The only tool that teachers have for dealing with disruptive children is force of personality, and it is unfortunate that some teachers do not have this. Children are aware that teachers have very little powers and they use this to their advantage. Dealing with disruptive children, day in, day out can become very frustrating, especially when you are very restricted in what you can do. I was lucky in that I have a very strong voice, and when raised it can be used to good effect. Is it going to become the case that even this tool of discipline is going to be taken away from teachers?      Had phone lines like Child Line existed when I was a young teenager I am sure that my friends and I would have been ringing them every night with stories of abuse, all completely fictional. So if abuse statistics are calculated from these calls they are probably vastly inflated. As for teachers, if anyone wanted to get a job that brings them into contact with children for sinister reasons, there must be far easier routes than by becoming a teacher.      As a ""strict"" and loving parent I agree with Rob and Gerry. I am always amazed how many adults let themselves be tyrannised by badly behaved, spoiled children. Surely discipline is just plain common sense! Everybody, child or adult, should learn to take both the responsibility for, and the consequences of their actions.      I think the whole issue of discipline has been blown out of proportion. Parents should always take the responsibilities seriously and show their children what is right or wrong. I do not advocate beating the child to pulp in the name of discipline but do not believe in sparing the rod and spoiling the child. The laws of the land have gone to the extremes and the teachers me being one know that children brought up with no sense of discipline and respect are the ones who will ultimately be juvenile delinquents. "
HOC HOC-MN -0.19 " Judging by what Mr Sharon has done in the past he is no different to indicted Serbian war criminals, is he? Shouldn't the election of a war criminal as the prime minister of a democratic country ring the alarm bells around the world. Still, I very much hope there is lasting peace for innocent Israeli and Palestinians. Ms Lewis Westbury, should Jewish people have the right to claim their land and assets, which were looted by the Nazis?? I think they should.      There will never be peace in the Middle East until one side loses. Losing in the Middle East means being wiped off the face of the Earth so obviously both sides are doing their best to make sure it is the other side. Wouldn't you?      If Two States in One Land option is not possible with Israeli settlements strategically situated over the every vital road, water source and above every Palestinian town. Why do not they try Two Nation One Land option? As the case in Canada, the English and the French fought for years but now they are living in a reasonable harmony. One may ask what should be the name of this country? Does not matter the name. Egypt is named Misser in Arabic, Israel can also be called Palestine in Arabic      I don't believe either candidate will bring peace. Two old arrogant generals with innocent blood on their hands, with no humanity. Both make empty ""peace"" promises where peace means ""pre-emptive strikes"" and Israel-centred imposed solutions. Until Israel is led by civilians, Palestinians are considered equals, and their rights and needs addressed, there will be no peace.      Is it really in the best interests of the USA to be such a fanatical ally of Israel these days? Surely the most important thing for the USA in the Middle East is maintaining a stable price for oil. I think that the USA may soon have to make a choice between the two - oil or Israel. They must realize that they can't have everything. Neil Maybanks, Australia      Until such time that Israel has a gifted leader who can foresee that its only, I repeat, only hope in long term survival in the heart of the Arab world is to gain acceptance by the Palestinians. Therefore, it follows that more narrow-minded the leader it elects the bleaker is its future. Talks about ""concessions"" to the Palestinians is utter nonsense. You cannot make a ""concession"" by returning something to its rightful owner.      There have been problems in Isreal since time began (see the Bible), and I don't suspect we are going to see any difference this time. This last 10 years we've seen Labour, Likud, then Likud, then Labour, and now Likud again. I really do think we should keep out of it to be honest. It's a problem we've never been able to control anyway.      I would like to respond to Rob Hocker's statement quoting Golda Meir about Arabs loving their own children more than they hate the Jews. Golda Meir was also fond of stating that Palestine didn't exist, and that Palestinians didn't exist. This is a view that Ariel Sharon shares. But since Palestinians do exist, its quite apparent that Sharon, and his supporters like Rob Hocker, will never achieve peace by denying the truth.      What is peace? Is it the absence of war, the absence of strife, the absence of fighting? Or rather is peace living together in a spirit of co-operation, acceptance, consideration and harmony, friendship and even love? If the violence and fighting ends, is peace really solved when two peoples live in a land, quietly seething with hatred and despising each other? Peace begins in the heart. It is hardly possible to ""love our neighbours as ourselves"" when our hearts are filled with hatred for one another. It is unreasonable to expect politicians to sign a peace agreement that would change our hearts towards one another.      Until Israel accepts the right of the Palestinians to self-determination in their own land there would and should not be peace in the occupied territories. There must come a time when the same rule applies to everyone. UN resolutions must be carried out irrespective of race, creed or religion. Resolution 242 is 4 decades old and yet never implemented. That shows the West's bias against the Palestinians.      The upcoming vote is not a vote of Barak vs. Sharon. It is a vote of Arafat vs. Sharon. The people of Israel adore Barak, but do despise his peace partner for not even agreeing to any concessions brought up by Israel. Barak is the mask behind Arafat.      Some are trying to make the Arab-Israeli conflict seem like a religious one, putting Arab Moslems and Christians at one side and Jews at the other. The fact is that, to Palestinians, this is a desperate conflict for survival, for shelter and for a home. Peace will never come to the Middle East until the Israeli government and public realise that the millions of refugees Israel created by kicking them out of their homes are humans too, in need of security and shelter, capable of hatred as well as love. How Israel plans to deal with the refugee problem is a mystery.      I think it is pointless to put so much effort and hope in the current on and off peace process, when one really looks at what is being offered to the Arabs, for instance only 22% of the original homeland is being offered! I mean with such humiliation who would want to sign a deal? If one is to go by the Jewish scriptures one should remember a famous quote ""one should treat another like one would wanted to be treated"". This way both parties can come to a sensible outcome!      Don't forget that among Palestinian Moslems who fight for their land, there are a lot of Palestinian Christians. So it is not a religion ""war"". It is a fight to get back their land. So, How can Sharon can bring a piece when he himself never recognises Palestinians as human (remember Sabra & Sathilla Massacre)      The Israeli public have seen how the Palestinians have responded to Barak's repeated and increasing concessions with increasing demands and increasing violence. It's no surprise that they're voting for Sharon. The Palestinians have only themselves to blame for making Sharon electable.      I despair of Israel. Such hope when it was founded now? Where is the humanity that should spring for a people so wronged? There again maybe they are doing just what you and I would if we lived there!      As the current violence in Israel demonstrates, both Oslo and the incredible concessions made by Barak cannot placate a people dedicated to the destruction of Israel. For years, the PA Charter has called for Israel's destruction, and after many promises to remove the clause, it yet remains. How can Israel be expected to talk ""peace"" with a people whose charter states that their ""peace partner"" has no right to exist? Sharon can't change that, but he can bring stability by insisting that no talks will take place until the violence ends, the charter is amended, and the PA stops teaching (and using) children to kill Israelis. As Golda Meir has said, ""There will be peace when the Arabs love their children more than they hate the Jews"".      The naiviety of western politicians amazes me; there will never be peace in the Middle East --- because the presence of Israel in the ""Muslim Holy Land"" is considered an outrage by Arabic Leaders. An illustration, the difference tone between what Arafat says when speaking in English, and when speaking in Arabic. More extremist elements of the Muslim world will not rest until Israel is annihilated. Sadly, peace will not come in our lifetime.      For everyone's sake, let's hope Barak wins. People are attracted by Sharon's tougher line, but of course if it hadn't been for his provocation in September, then we wouldn't be in this mess. A victory for Sharon would please the intransigent extremists on both sides, by stagnating the peace process Netanyahu-style. Very many Israelis and Diaspora Jews are appalled at the prospect of this man getting in, especially when both sides said only last week that they have never been closer to an agreement.      Weather it's Palestine, Khasmir, Checynea, Iraq, Sudan,Afghanistan, Bosnia and Kosovo Muslim life is cheap in the eyes of the west, and until this crusader mentality ends all this talk of peace is worthless.      Sadly, with an Israeli prime minister of virtually any political hue, a confrontational situation on the ground which pits stone-throwing youths against tanks, bullets and bulldozers, and a 'broker' so obviously biased towards one of the parties, the prospects for peace remain bleak. I should like to see the Europeans playing a more prominent role in the process, though I fear the Israelis would not be too happy with that. What a shame it is that the US seems incapable of applying the same high-minded principles to Israeli acts as it has done towards those of Iraq and Serbia, for instance.      Peace means making confessions and making confessions means accepting the other party's basic rights. As long as Israel does not grant Palestinians with their basic right to go back home there cannot be peace. And Israelis should realize that war is worse for them than for Palestinians as the refugees have nothing to lose.      It is not within the power of an Israeli Prime Minister to 'make peace': it requires the Palestinian Authority to abandon its macabre fantasy of destroying Israel and finally to accept its obligation under UN Security Council Resolution 242 to abandon hostilities against Israel. Urging Israel to make territorial compromises is redundant advice when every Israeli government since 1967 has pursued that course, treating the occupied territories as judicially separate from Israel and as bargaining counters in negotiations. The Barak government has even proposed withdrawing from 95 per cent of the West Bank, offered the Golan Heights to Syria and agreed to the creation of a Palestinian state. Yet the Arabs have responded with lynch mobs and inflammatory rhetoric.      History has shown that Palestinians and Jews can live together in peace. So I believe that Israelis should give in and allow the refugees to go back. As long as the Palestinians are not given their basic rights as humans there can't be peace and the Intifada will continue. And the Israelis will sooner or later learn that bullets are not the right answer to stones.      Barak has shown that he is unwilling to accept the conditions the Palestinians require for the creation of a viable Palestinian state. He has continued to build settlements on occuppied territory, and exercises a policy of ethnic and religious descrimination within Israel. In South Africa this was called Apartheid. Such conditions do not pave the way for peace. Sadly, Ariel Sharon is even more unreasonable. Perhaps if Shimon Peres is able to stand, there will be some possibilty of peace in the region.      The danger of Arab-Israeli war actually increased since Oslo, and the major cause is Arabs' perception of a weak Israel: A country that persists in making more concessions, no matter how little it gets in return. This they see as a sign of desperation and they respond with aggression. That should come as no surprise; as the Russian proverb puts it, ""if you want to attract wolves, act like a lamb."" Sharon will change Israel's stance, and this will actually enhance regional stability.      Sooner or later Israel and Palestine will make peace. I might be just 15 years old but that doesn't mean I don't know what is going on in Israel. I'm also a Christian, and the Bible speaks of one who will bring a peace agreement between Israel and her enemies.      Peace is not a one handshake process, you need two hands for a handshake, with the present mentality and the values that are taught to youngsters on either side of the border it makes no difference if either Sharon or Barak come to power. We are kidding ourselves into believing that some sort of Peace will exist in the troubled region.      Sharon, Barak it doesn't matter who leads in Israel. What does matter is the U.S. You see for all Clinton's peace efforts in that region, he never put any real pressure on the Israeli's because of the massive pro-Israeli lobby's in the U.S. Bush can bring peace tommorow to that region if he simply got his adminstration to come up with a peace plan which fair and acceptable to both sides.      After over 3000 years of conflict between Arabs and Israelis we expect one election to change the whole process? Is that really logical, or is peace too much to expect from two men who lead two different nations and two different peoples?      Barak is by far the better of the two - if Israel wants an escalation in violence then Sharon is the man - the Palestinians are not keen on Barak, but they absolutely despise Sharon, and with good cause. Although Barak has not done the best job, Sharon will do far worse!!!      Regardless who will be the devil in a dove clothes in Isreal, peace will never exist as long as the Palestinians keep begging for small islands in their own land and their own country.      Sharon is a war criminal personally responsible for the deaths of over 75,000 in Lebanon, including the Sabra and Shatila massacres. Asking him to bring peace to the region is like asking Hitler to bring peace to Europe.      Israelis will vote for Sharon because they have seen that conciliation and compromise from Barak has been met by violence and terror by Arafat. One senses that Arafat would prefer a Sharon victory because it would give him another opportunity to wriggle out of making peace. The wider Middle East, unlike Britain, is a place where compromise is seen as weakness and violence as strength - this is Israel's dilemma - it has tried to make peace and it has been rebuffed and met by violence. Sharon will also try and make peace, indeed he has a track record in government of involvement in peace treaties signed by previous Likud governments. Sharon is being demonised by the UK media as a war monger and a man who strikes fear in to the Palestinians but people seem quick to forget that Israel has bitten its collective tongue and tried to negotiate for nearly a decade with the arch terrorist Arafat who has taken and taken from Israel but has not given one iota back.      Mr Sharon's approach will disillusion the Arab leaders of their hopes to get rid of the ""Zionist entity"". He will force them to think about the long lasting peace. History shows that so called ""hawks"" have done more for peace than the ""doves"": let's remember the late Menachim Begin who signed peace with Egypt, President Reagan who forced the USSR to end the ""cold war"" . I am sure Mr. Sharon is the best choice for the peace process in the Middle East.      It seems to us in the West that Arafat has passed up a relatively good deal (considering his weak position) and has held out for a much less compromising 'partner' in Sharon. This puzzles us, but we have to realize that, although Barak's 'peace deal' seems reasonable to us, it meant something very different to Palestinians. To us, Sharon and Barak seem so different, but to the Palestinians, an Israeli bullet is an Israeli bullet, tear gas is tear gas.      Being the only Jewish state against 50 Islamic nations, Israel needs all the World's help and sympathy. Western governments and the people living there should wholeheartedly support Israel's efforts at peace making. Madan Mehta      The real irony of this democratic election is that it will result in an increase in tensions between Israel and the Palestinians as well as its surrounding neighbours. It will also create huge tensions/ problems for the leaders of nations such as Egypt and Jordan who have signed 'peace' deals. I think the election is somewhat of a foregone conclusion, the real interest will be how the administration of G.W. Bush (note my keyboard still has the 'W' key) will respond. Unlike the previous democratic administration, this administration has serious and personal vested interests in the oil producing countries who are referred often as the 'other' friends of the US.      The Israeli and Palestinians are brothers by blood yet they have been fighting for thousand of years. It's about time to change to a new chapter. The chapter of peace and trust.      Ever hopeful though I am for a route to peace to be found in the Middle East, I think that the idea of the election bringing that is naively optimistic. Indeed, how can peace be achieved at all in a situation where there is so marked a polarity of opinion? The most tragic feature of the strife is that it is so evocative of the painfully similar situations that can be observed in history.      A change of leader in Israel certainly brings fresh hope for peace. Any new leader may be willing to compromise on any number of issues. That's assuming Barak loses.      There will probably never be peace as long as both Israel and Palestine want control of all of East Jerusalem. I believe the Temple Mount should be governed by an International group. Whoever controls it must respect both the Israelis and the Palestinians.      Neither of them are exactly 'doves'. I suspect that the 'New Intifada' will continue, and whoever is in power will use unacceptable force to quell it. The Palestinians do not trust either of them, and I for one cannot blame them.      Barak and Sharon are different sides of the same coin. Neither has the courage nor the will to recognise the wrongs that the Israelis have perpetrated against the Palestinians. Until that is done, there will never be real peace in the region.      The truth is the Palestinians are being offered 95% of the west bank and some land in Israel to make up for the other 5%. The truth is Arafat can never make peace for neither he nor his people want it.      Two chances - fat and none      You imply that what is really needed here is for Israel to compromise. But don't forget how small Israel is, and how they had to fight for their very survival not that long ago. Peace is always a good thing, but at what price ?      There will never be a peace in the Middle East as long as the United Nations Security Council resolutions against Isreal are not implimented. Israel is in defiance of more than 69 United Nations Security Council resolutions and it has been protected from 30 more by US vetoes. The solution to the Middle East crisis is in the hand of Isreal and its most powerful lobby in the US. I hope the current US Administration will reialize that Isreal is becoming a liability and distance it self from it until the UN resolutions are implimented.      How can the impending elections bring peace to the Israli nation, when it it is obvious to all concerned that Ariel Sharon and the Likud party will take a much firmer line when it comes to striking a peace deal. If Yasser Arafat cannot accept Mr Barak terms, he will never find a common ground with Mr Sharon.      If you can eradicate fear , hatred , lack of education , greed and bitterness then maybe then Israelis and Palestinians will be able to live side by side in harmony. These changes cannot be made overnight and the same questions will probably be asked a few centuries from now      I do not know who should control the West Bank, but I believe that if Ariel Sharon is elected Prime Minister then violence in the Middle East will reach a point not seen in years.      Should I be allowed to return to the homes of my great uncles and aunts in Poland and Germany? Do I have that right? No. Why should it be granted to the Arabs?      The likely election of Ariel Sharon, a war criminal and unashamed racist, is a depressing reflection of the Israeli electorate's true intentions concerning Middle East peace. "
JOC JOC-12A-04N -0.62 "I was very impressed by this story. Even if she got to be able to walk by the support of the ""ReWalk suit"", it must be hard for her to complete a long-distance marathon. she could walked about only two miles a day, and it took 16 days to finish the marathon. If I were in her position, I could not keep running. Although she could not receive the official medal, she must be very happy to get the special medals which a dozen of other runners made.  I received impression in this tale. Her challenge is very amazing and I respect her challenge spirit. If I am same position as her I will be discouraged. so I think she is amazing. And I think surrounding support is important for her challenge. For the reason, it was able to obtain the medal which is not formal as for her Same as ID12063, I was very impressed by this story. To tell the truth, first of all, I felt the marvelous ability of the bionic suit. This ReWalk suit could prove that enable paralyzed people to walk himself/herself publicly. I thought that the stuff of the company that designed the suit had been enthusiastic about their works and done everything in their power for paralyzed people. I want to praise them. Also, I noticed Claire Lomas's great perseverance. As ID12063's opinion, Even if she got the suit, he must have made an effort and keep doing hard work for a long time. At this time she could not receive a medal. I think it is natural. However she should be considered to be one of the runners who could reach the goal. We ought to give her and her family a big hand.  and their family.  After reading this story, it made my heart warm because Lomas never gave up during the race and when she finishes her 26.2 mile marathon, other runners in the race gave their own medals which i think they were also cheering her to finish. and also i was impressed on advance in science that we know today. this story realize me how enormous technology is and technologies are upgrading every seconds and it is making our life affluent.  As ID12063 and ID12054 say, this news impressed me deeply. Her efforts and hardships must have been beyond my imagination until she completed the marathon course. I respect her efforts and achievement. I realized again that it was important to do it without giving up until I finish. In the future I hope that bionic suit will spread in the world and the people paralyzed below the waist will be able to walk as technology develops and bionic suit becomes cheaper.  I have three impression things in this story. First, Wearing bionic ReWalk suit enabled Claire Lomas to complete the 26.2 miles. I felt her will was very strong. Second, a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. I think that they would really look up to her in a way which she was trying without being discouraged by adversity. Finally, she raised more than yen 11 million for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. I think that since she had many support, she would repay to the handicapped.  When I read this article, I'm surprised that she decided to run long-distance marathon even though she became paralyzed. Most of all, I'm impressed by her toughness to accomplish the goal. I think this achievement will help other paralyzed people not to lose their hope.  As many students said, I was impressed and surprised by reading this story. I can't imagine how hard she tried to walk everyday. It must be very difficult time, however, she bore her hardship! She made it and succeeded in her life! I respect her. I think I am not able to try hard like her. I expect I should have desire to improve myself :) I was astonished at her patience and effort. She continually went on walking for no less than 16 days! It's quite true her bionic ReWalk suit made it possible for her to move her paralyzed leg more smoothly. However, more important factors in her achievement are her strong belief in overcoming the physical disability and her families' cheer. As she said, she sometimes worried whether she could finish the marathon, but she continued practicing little by little, encouraged by her families. Without these two factors, she couldn't have completed it. The disabled will be encouraged by her achievement.  I was impressed by this story. I guess it was hard to complete a marathon in a bionic suit but she did it. I think many people have encouraged by her.  I was happy after reading this article. It is recently said that science technology damage the Earth and threaten our life. It is also said that only think about convenient. However, science technology can help us such as Lomas. I think science technology will developed more convenient to us.  This story impressed me. I hope these technology will develop for handicapped person.  Re Walk suit was very useful to complete the marathon. However, I think her emotional strength was greater. If I were her, I gave up to run to the last. I learned the importance of challenging through this text.  I was very moved by this story. I can't imagine how hard she made efforts. But I can understand this challenge was very difficult to overcome. I wish that this success encourage other people who have handicaps. I was also surprised at science and technology. We can't live without it now. I hope technology develops and makes our lives more and more comfortable.  When I read this article, I was impressed about the bionic suit. There are many people who have handicap in the world. Because of some handicap, handicapped people have to give up normal life style. However, they also have rights to spend normal life like us. Thanks to this bionic suit, I think many handicapped people's dream will come true. I hope technology of bionic suits will develop as soon as possible.  This news so impressed me. This British woman's effort is beyond my imagination. Marathon is not easy for a person with a healthy body. With her handicap, she puled it off. Her action is worthy of praise. And, I also be moved new technology. I hope developing of science save all of paralyzed people .  In my opinion, the woman's success is greatly owing to her strong will. To be sure, she couldn't so much as entering this competition without ReWalk suit. But, no non-handicapped person could succeed in finishing the race only because of his/her normal body. It is ones will that leads to the person's accomplishment. So, the suit only helped her coming up alongside of other people without any disability.  I have read another article like this. A handicapped person is likely to contribute, make a fund which help people get over the difficulty. I think this is good! Having read this article, I was so impressed with it. I think people in this society should learn how to make great efforts from the runner. And she taught us that you can do anything if you try or challenge hard. Regarding the bionic suit helped the runner finish the marathon, I was very amazed by the fact the technology has actually grown this far. So, I look forward to that recent technology will keep growing and give people a hope.  I was pretty impressed by this article. I thought Technology could make an impossibility to be a possibility. This article is not only about the Technology but also about the Human Spirit. If she was not Lomas, or she didn't have the physical handicap, she wouldn't make efforts and be attracted our attention. Having handicap is not good, but she could succeed with it. Therefore paralysis had her to do well. I praise her courage and toughness I am impressed with this article. I feel Claire Lomas has a tough spirit. Of course, if there wasn't a bionic suit, she couldn't complete a marathon. But, I think that we need skills and a courage to complete a marathon. So, I feel that we have to have strength of mental and skills to attain a great thing. I want to be a strong man. And I don't want to give up if I face troubles like Claire Lomas.  I was surprised at and impressed by her efforts and strength. If I were her, I would only be sad about my handicap. However, she didn't so. She didn't lose her handicap, and she rather overcame it with her unimagined efforts. I think she would encourage many people who have handicap. I also think the bionic suit which helped her success is wonderful. I hope this suit will help more handicapped people to lead better lives.  I want to celebrate her achievement and also want to put emphasis on Amit Goffer's accomplishment. I hope that more technology for goods for the people like her will be developed. For that, people who study the technology should be supported by nations or groups like NPO. Especially, I heard that many Japanese researchers have abilities to develop the technology like this. We should support them. Also, we have to think about people who need goods but can't buy them because of the luck of the money.  I was amazed to see this article. Claire Lomas completed a full marathon although she has a tough handicap. I strongly appreciate and admire her great efforts and feat. I'm not one of the disabled but I cannot do such a thing. I think the technical innovations we didn't realize around 10 years ago made her wish come true. And I suppose she could not had got over her obstacles without many supports of her family, her husband Dan and their daughter Maisie, and her parents and this her great achievement will surely encourage the disabled all over the world.  I was so impressed with this article. I think it was not easy for everyone to complete. The strength of her spirit is so inscrutable. The more technologies improve, the more we forget importance of effort to achieve something. Also, her great achievement didn't consist of only fine technology, ReWalk suit. I think this news encourages everyone, including non-handicapped people and handicapped people.  I was encouraged by reading this news. I think everyone who read this news were encouraged too. Clair Lomas, who had disadvantages of becoming paralyzed, completed a marathon because of a bionic suit but I think that is not the only reason why she made it. She could not have crossed the goal line without helps of her family, her husband and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. What we can learn from this is that you can overcome predicaments if there are emotional mainstays you get from someone very close to you. Also, I was very impressed by her charity work which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. She did not satisfied just with extending her possibility, but she is also trying to open up more possibilities for those people who are suffering from the same situations as she had. Maybe, we have to not only focusing on a bionic suit but also on the importance of relationships between human beings, when reading this news. Do not forget that ""what you cannot overcome by yourself can overcome with the help of each other"".  I was moved by this article. I thought she was so brave to have made a decision to attend such a hard sports like marathon instead of her difficulty. I think I can't do the same thing if I were her. Her guts was really great. And, because her husband, daughter and parents cheered her everyday, she could continue the hard exercise and success like this. I guess. Well, I want to be like Lomas. I want to success like her no matter how horrible adversity I will be faced to.  Whose success is the example like this? I think it is a human power. Of course, the person helped by technology strived very much. And the technology was invented by the people who want to help another people. Many technology successes were not technology's successes but human's successes.  I was very impressed about this story. If I were her, I would have give up running marathon. so I think she is very tough!!! When her husband was married her, he did not mind her handicap. He is very nice guy.  After reading this article, I made two remarks. First, I suppose it's important to have strong spirit and make an effort. If I lost my legs, I would give up even walking. In this case, though Lomas put on a bionic suit, continuous effort probably made her success, I think. Second, being supporters encourage people who work hard to do something. For me, parents and friends often cheer up when I feel sadness or stress, so I want to be a good supporter for someone at one time.  This article is moved me. I think that Claire Lomas has a firm belief. But in the world, however strong belief she has, there is a thing which she cannot do by herself. I think that there are three reasons why she could complete a marathon. Of course, first reason is that she made efforts to run the marathon. Second reason is due to bionic suit. Third reason, this is the most important reason, is that her family supported her. Probably, if she practice running a marathon alone, she may give up. But she achieve reaching a goal because her husband and her daughter continued to cheered up her. I strongly believe that there is a close bond of family. Furthermore, I think that we should try to develop links of the charity which support people with a disability and people who became paralyzed. It is possible for us to become paralyzed or have disability by accidents. However, someone who became paralyzed can enjoy sports by using advanced technology like bionic Re walk suit. But it cost them a lot of money to use advanced technology. So we need to increase the number of supporters who participate in charities for them.  Since I have an uncle who have trouble walking due to polio, I was deeply impressed by this news. I also heard of achievement in the study of artificial sight. This kind of achievement will be light of hope for handicapped people.  In this story, we can see not only an achievement of a paralyzed British woman, but also the development in science and technology. I think these technologies will help more and more people in the future. New scientific developments may be changing the world. But encouragement from others is also important. I think no matter how well-developed science and technology, the importance of the ties that bind people will not change.  I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity. she I was impressed by this article, and I admired her success. It is not easy to decide to run 42.2 kilometers though she is paralyzed. This achievement taught that importance of having ambition and making an effort to us.  I was very surprised when I read this news. Even though the body was crippled in an accident, I was very surprised that she ran 42 kilometers. I have not finished the marathon. I would like to finish a marathon someday.  Scientific techniques enables us things like we have never thought. A paralyzed person completed marathon. This is really amazing. To raise the convenience is of course, to bring out the dreamer in men is a part of scientific techniques too.  I was so impressed with her patience. If I were Claire Lomas, I would give up running a marathon. She didn't give up because people around her welcomed her from the bottom of their heart. I want to run a marathon someday, too.  I was so impressed by this article, too. And I thought her achievement was supported by not only the technology but her strong spirit and cooperation between her and people around her. So this is why this article attract many people, I think.  This article was surprising for me. I could not believe the first. . . but, this is the fact. I can't imagine her despair when she know that she can't walk by herself. However, she never gave up and walk and walk. . . in the end, she was able to achieve!! I was moved this story.  I think that the woman cheer people who has handicap. Scientific techniques enables us to do things like we have never thought. I want the handicapped not to give up anything because of their handicap.  I was very impressed to hear the news. And I received courage and felt a weight has been taken off my mind. Because one reason is that a handicapped person such as Lomas taught us importance of effort and never giving up. The other reason is that science is of use. It is often said that science technology damage the earth and our life. I hope that science technology is good for us.  I was very impressed after hearing this news. She completed the 42.195km course even she had difficulty in working. I understand that the bionic suit was good, but her heart was strong therefore I was so impressed. I tried half-marathon in April but after the marathon I thought that it is hard to finish the full marathon because I was so tired. I understand how hard the marathon is, so I think that what she did is wonderful.  I was extremely impressed by the story and also encouraged by what Claire has done. She has achieved such a great work in marathon not just because she was wearing a high-technology bionic suit, but also because she had her mind very set and tried amazingly hard. If I were running in the same race as her, I would have given her a big hug and told her that she should be very proud of herself. Also, it made me happy to know that other runners gave their medals to Claire for her great job. They probably felt the same way as me.  I was moved by hearing this news. Technology that helped her was very great. Nowadays, many people were bothered by physically handicap. So this bionic suits can help such a person. If many handicapped persons are helped by technology, the world will be better place. I heartily hope such a future made by technology.  This comment shows how great Claire is. I agree with this comment because I also think that her achievement is not only due to the bionic suit. Her continuous efforts made it possible. This comment is very understandable so I chose this.  when I was read this news, I was very impressed and surprised. I absolutely impossible for me to complete a marathon in the body paralyzed. If I were her, I would have given up. I think that they were encouraged when people of the same situation with her was heard this news. I want to develop more bionic suit.  For me, the article is impressive because the technology is used in a good way. I think technology is extension of human body. Thanks to high technology, human did a lot of achievement. This story is obvious example of that kind of achievement. These days, invention of high technology is always controversial thing among people. But I think technology is neutrality thing. People should not impede invent technology. But I argue applying of invented technology must discussion by people democratically.  I think ReWalk suit is very good thing! Because I think paralyzed people are helped by ReWalk suit, also ReWalk suit bring the joy of walking for paralyzed people.  I was very impressed by this story. She ran marathon even she had difficulty in walking, it's so unbelievable and admirable. I belong to track&field club in Keio university, so I respect her spirit. And the development of technology is also surprising. ReWalk suit is hilarious thing, and it's very useful for disabled people.  The development of technology sometimes cause bad effects like environmental pollution, but this news is a good example. The achievement of a woman with bionic suit makes a big hope for many people. I wish many more technologies will make our life much more comfortable.  I was happy to hear the news as the technology made it possible to do a thing that had been thought to be impossible. I've heard a phrase as following: things that human can imagine are the things that can be realized. I do not remember whose wise it is, but I realized it true.  I think Technology is important.  I also think if I were in her position, I gave up running. So her spirit was very tough! She received more important something than she could not receive the official medal.  Not only the high technology but also her patient spirit enables her to complete the marathon. I wanted to praise her brave figure.  I was very impressed by this story too. The bionic suit enable the handicapped to walk freely. What a hopeful suit it is!! However, as ID12054 said, if it had not been for their perseverance, they couldn't use the bionic suits.  I was impressed this news. The strength of the woman's will and the help of her family are very beautiful. I hope the society changed into more comfortable place for handicapped people.  I think evolution of medicine is amazing.  When I read this article I was impressed by Claire's family ties and encouraged by what she have achieved. She is loved by her family. I felt that their love and cheering for her encouraged her. That is why, I think, she can have made a decision to attend such a hard marathon and have achieved. And the story inspired me to greater effect.  I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity.  I was deeply moved by this story. She never gave up. It is hard for a person with a normal too to run a marathon. she achieved this without being discouraged by adversity.  I agree with her comment about a woman's marathon with bionic suit in Britain. This news made me happy like her and encourage that if I'll do things without giving up, any dream comes true. Also, I was surprised about bionic suit because I didn't know about it until I read this article. There are still many patients that want this new technology in the world. I hope this technology will help all people and everyone can make their dreams come true.  Since moving paralyzed body is very painful, although she complete a marathon with putting on a bionic suit, her try deserves to be praised. By the way, after reading this article, I wondered normal people putting on this suit. Since this ReWalk suit can mimic the response of whereas's joints, it would be a great energy to move. At once, I had became to want to wear a bionic suit too.  Her strong will that she didn't want to lose her disability made her run. And I thought she got a great sense of achievement. At the same time, a lot of people with a disability cheered up. Thanks to the progress of technology, she could try this race. Technology sometimes makes us happy.  At first I was surprised to hear this news and a little moved. And the thing that she could run to the goal is so nice for her cuz she wanted to run again. But at the same time, I'm a little scared. For, we human come to make everything we want and that means we can use something we made in order to pursue some bad things.  I really impressed by this story. I could felt people can anything if thy have a passion. The sadness being paralysis is huge I guess. She got over the sadness and trying to encourage other paralysis people. This action can be honor. I wish i have same passion to going school.  I agree with his comment because it is similar to what I wrote on the article. I was very impressed by this news. Although the British woman had difficulty in walking, she completed a long marathon(42.195km). His comment said that he could not keep running if he were in her position. This is what I thought exactly. She did it because she had a strong heart. In the future, I will try the marathon but I need to have strong heart like hers.  Although she was not rewarded with a medal, I think it was heart-warming that she made it to the end with the bionic suit. In future, I hope this bionic suit will become much cheaper so more people who are physically challenged will be able to use it in their daily lives.  I had pretty much the same impression and I was also moved by the fact that she made it to the end.  I thought this is really nice and heart warming news. But I also have other thoughts for this kind of news. I've heard of the news that man who has a artificial leg will participate in a Olympic because of his great performance at the last two Paralympics. When I first heard this news , I thought this is really nice news just like I read the news about British woman who run marathon in a bionic suit. But then I start to worry about the fairness. Maybe waring more expensive suite can make the runner run faster. Or maybe some player would feel unfairness to people wearing those things. But I'm sure that player wont be able to say so because it sounds immoral. I think it is really nice thing to give chance to handicapped people but I also think that this is not that simple problem.

JOC JOC-12B-09O -0.71 "I do not agree with ID12059's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. Of course it is a serious problem that Mr. Abe resigned from president because he had a disease. However, according to William Saroyan, a man of ability can learn a lot from failures. This statement apply to Mr. Yoshida. After he resigned from president, he had been president again. Eventually, he took Japanese independence back. He learned a lot from failures. This example will apply to Mr. Abe. I believe that he will do good job. I hope Japanese people believe that too.  I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout, not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required.  Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11. They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call ""abenomics"". I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and South. We must compare territorial problem with east asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation, and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own.  Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-defense Forces to be National Defense Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time.  I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr. Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.  Abe lost election six years ago. I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do. But this time, he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted.  Recently, the relationship between Japan and China is getting worse. Moreover, Japanese economy falls into deflation. Japan is under crisis now. I expect a lot from Abe in terms of improving Japanese recession.  I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.  I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems.  I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields. "
JOC JOC-13A-09N -0.51 "I cannot decide which side(admiration of Snowden or rebuke of Snowden)I am willing to agree. Both sides have their own reasons for their claims. This news made me think about the question, "" Is it allowable to force people to be victims for the interests of the countries?"" Of course it is important to defend interests of countries, but I thought fundamental human rights should not be dismissed because these rights must be the important elements of democratic countries. Especially, privacy rights are significant in this information age.  I would say that Snowden is both a hero and a traitor. Snowden may have broken the law, but it is obvious that national invasion of US citizens' privacy has much more to be impeached. This news reminded me of the last stage of nations such as USSR. Though Snowden is a traitor for the people who make a profit by secretly collected data, he is a hero for most of US citizens.  I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research. If we believe it, the nation can not exist in the first place. So, we should approve that research is for the society. But, invasion of privacy by malice government may exist. Then, we must support the whistleblower if he arrests. But, we do not need to support a traitor as if a hero.  When I read this article, I think Edward Snowden has two sides of hero and traitor. Surely, though he believe what he did is right, it is against the low so his action is classified in bad things. But it is sure that there are the rights by his action. Whether he is hero or not is affected by what we think most important.  To be frank, I felt that it is great that Edward acted even risked his position for a first impression. Although, I do not mean his actions are correct in all points . I think that if to divulge confidential benefit the public, his behavior may be correct for the most part. However, there is a risk confusing , he has to be careful if divulge confidential. In summary, the public's right to know and to defend the law, which should also be respected. So, this problem is difficult.  I don't know which I should agree. They claimed their opinion based on their justice. But I think when it comes to collision between group force and a person, we should consider about basic human right : privacy right.  This is difficult for me to decide that he is hero or traitor, which side is better? When I read this news, I thought low is really difficult thing. Even if someone does good thing for citizens, it sometimes happens that he is punished, like this news.  I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking US information. However, I think that international society also needs those who do action like him. I want him to escape so that it may not be caught by the United States.  I want to take a neutral position. What he did was brave, and thank to his action we could know the truth of NSA. He told us only using the Internet is dangerous. On the other hand, what he did was an illegal act. Letting out the secret should be punished. When he was employed, his employer didn't assume such an incident.  Reading this article, frankly speaking, I would like to praise him. However, I disagree with his Edward Snowden's action. Surely, he did a important leak in American history. But he endangered so many people at the same time. It is to advantage of someone on the one hand, but it is to disadvantage of the other people on the other hand. If his action is admired breaking the low, where is the significance of the low's being?It means everybody can do anything which they regard as right thing. So I think he should have more thought carefully and reconsidered the importance of the low.  To be shame, I think that spy is a virtual job in the movie. Frankly, I was so exciting during reading this article, though I understand it is serious news. However, I expect that the number of spy will decrease. Now, more and more countries are controlled by information and most of information are treated not via a person but via Internet. So, I think that ""a digital spy"" will be active in the future world.  I don't think he did a very good job. Actually, he revealed the fact that there are lots of violating of human rights, but because of him some countries now cannot help avoiding the problems between other countries which they didn't want to touch. He caused visible conflicts around the world, some of which should be left untouched for the international peace. A perfectly clear government is impossible to be made, so I think he is a traitor.  I think that this article is like a movie, because I can not believe spy really exist. I want to support Edward Snowden as hero of ordinary people. He did not choose his safety, but choose citizens's safety. I think that almost people could not choose citizen's safety. Therefore, I am being sides with him.  I praise Edward Snowden for his act. I have two reasons for this. First, I think what he did is right , because his act could prevent National Security Agency from violating human rights. The act of US surveillance programs could be invasion of privacy, so someone should stop it. Second, I want to praise him for his courage. If I were him, I couldn't leak information of NSA, because I would be afraid that I will lose my job and be arrested. So, I regard Edward Snowden as a hero.  I regard Edward Snowden as Traitor. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society. CIA employees should have been forced to keep information secret. Why did he do that seriously? It is dangerous for the CIA to keep the person like that because the law will be violated and all of the system will be in disorder. I think the CIA should find people who cannot obey its regulation to fire them. As you can see that I feel as though Snowden is Traitor, I do not agree with the idea of ID1304106123136. I do not believe that international society also needs those who do action like him, because more people reveal international secrets, more countries will face the violation of the law. That leads the bad relationship with other countries, even in globalization times. However, I agree with ID13021 when he says Snowden has caused visible conflicts around the world. It can be said that a gulf has formed between Russia and the US To eliminate unnecessary conflict globally, we should keep some information on our own.  When I heard this news, at first, I thought Edward had done virtuous conduct. However, after reading this article, I realized there was the exact opposite opinion that his action had been treason. Even though I still think his action was brave, because he tried telling us the fact despite the risk, I also think there is something in what they say. We often want to know facts but it is truth that there are sometimes facts which disturb the social order. As the saying goes, ""uso mo hoben "", which means it is sometimes necessary to lie. Facts are not always helpful for us, so I think it is very difficult to solve such information issue.  For example, let's think about the case that one officer who works at Japan Coast Guard leaked a video of Chinese ship's attack at Senkaku. In the case the uploader was forced to retire the job because he transgressed the duty to keep the secret. But the leak revealed the government's conceal and he got so much support by many people and it led him to be innocent. But in this case, Edward Snowden doesn't seem to reveal government's definitive corruption, and only to be said ""valiant"". I can't praise the action like him because he didn't make the result to be a hero.  I cannot decide whether he is a hero or a traitor. Of course he did break a law and it is not something to be praised. But thanks to him, we could know the information of NSA. His action was really brave and if I were him I would be too afraid to leak the information. It is too difficult for me to decide which side I should agree but there is one we all need to think about: privacy rights.  I think he didn't have to expose that NSA collect call data from major US cell carriers. He just confused the public. But the other day, I read an article about US citizen tolerate that, NSA was collecting call data from major US cell carriers, to prevent terrorism. NSA said they did interception to prevent terrorism. I understand, of course it's necessary for national defense. On the other hand, many country said ""our national sovereignty was infringed. "" I can understand both opinion. National defense and fighting against terrorism are so difficult issues. I think we have to think about those issues.  First of all, I'd like to admire Edward Snowden's brave action and regard him as a hero. I know what he did is unlawful and so he has received much more criticism or anger than admiration. However the most important fact is not its legality, but the details leaked by Snowden. He revealed that the U. S. authorities are monitoring each nation. Though they explain the program aims at preventing terrorism, I suppose it will be a total loss for general public. People probably don't want to be kept watch because of terrorism measures. In short, the program of NSA is vicious and we should take a look at this point. This article doesn't include opinions of the ordinary people. I think their opinions are more honest and significant because VIPs in the government or some organizations often say their thoughts by political position, not their own one.  According to this article, ""Edward Snowden has been hailed as a hero of civil liberties and rebuked as a self-absorbed traitor for revealing information on classified National Security Agency programs aimed at preventing terrorism"". I think it is hard to decide whether he is traitor or hero. However, I have the only answer. In short, he is hero if you are people. he is traitor if you are CIA.  I don't think he is a hero. It is true that the information he revealed is very serious problem. NSA shouldn't do such a thing for getting some useful information. However, it doesn't mean that he can justify his action. His action was unworthy of a secret agent. If he knew some information that the government did something wrong, he must have guard the secret. An agent has to guard the secret until he dies.  I think that Edward Snowden is not a hero. I also think that whatever some reasons he has, he should not leak classified information on US  I can't answer this question, because this is difficult for me. Snowden broke low, but it is really bad!? If I have to answer this question, I will say ""He is hero"" But I have obvious reason.  I partly disagree with naoeID13018's opinion. It is true that Edward Snowden has broken the law and he deserves punishment, but in terms of privacy issue, his act can be praised.  I agree with ID13007's idea. it is important to recognize that this problem is difficult to decide. Whether he is hero or agitator will be clear by time.  We can't make a wholesale decision of whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor because we don't know the concrete information which Snowden leaked. It is true that classified information is important and the leak of the information may harm us, but at the same time, enforcement of the authority by the concealment of those information may strengthen the dictatorship and harm our freedom of life. And in my opinion, there are too many dark side in the US authority and this, Snowden's action is one of the step that may reveal the dark side to the people.  I agree to your opinion , harry. Though the classified information may protect us from terrorism, surveillance against nation and whose people by single authority is a big problem, same as terrorism. Liberty should not be enjoyed by small part of nation or authority, it should be enjoyed by every people.  When I heard this news, I thought he is ""traitor"". There is not a organization like CIA in Japan, so we are unfamiliar with spying and this news is like movie and drama. He defects from his own country by a sense of justice in order to prosecute on line crimes of America. In this way, I think that he thinks ""hero"" rather than""traitor""himself. Consequently I can't decide that he is ""hero"" or ""traitor"".  I can not agree with ID13041's idea. If the nation allows the man like him, the nation will be destroyed by itself. In the first place, the government will not pervert the personal information. People should believe their government. Otherwise, they choose moving to other country or demurring to the government by the legitimate way.  I agree with ID13018's idea. The political affairs always become white wash and use a lie, but those action is to protect their nations. I think this case fits it, so Edward Snowden is a traitor. However, people must think about the government particularly and prevent the abuse of power.  When I heard this news, I thought that he was a traitor. As for the word ""spy"", Japanese people may not have familiarity. Possibly, it may be the word heard on the one scene of a movie. However, the occupation of CIA exists in the United States. After all, the personnel should keep the secrecy in the course of duties, also after retiring and it is the body which is that it is required for a country though, as for it, the country is supervising people , I think.  I know Snowden broke the law but I think he is a hero because he did it for all American citizens as one American citizen not as a member of NSA. Many people in America, also in Japan, want to open all information but we did realize that the government hide many important information from this Snowden case. He made a sacrifice of his life and family to open information. This is a great decision, don't you think so? I agree with your opinion. It is because leaking the secrecy of a state level has influence in respect of being various.  This thing is very difficult . As for his action, we can think both of right and wrong . I thought he is a hero at first, but I thought that on investigation he was a traitor. His action was not crime because it is an accusation . However, the action extinguishes the trust of a nation and the nation. All the actions that are not a crime may not be good. Only at the time of revolution, I could call him a hero.  Edward thinks that he is a hero. It is a crime surely to steal confidential information. However, Edward who gave the information which should be given to people is a hero. The secret of a country needs to be known by people. So that the secret is large. Edward is brave.  In my opinion, Edward Snowden did the wrong action that he leaked classified information on US surveillance programs. Of course, his action enabled people in US find that US violated their privacy, however his action endangered people in US Now that a lot of acts of terrorism happen in the world, and so the government have to take counter terror measures. One of them is U. S's collecting call data from major US cell carriers. I think that we should be willing for our government to violate our privacy in order to fly the approach of danger. In my conclusion, he is not a hero but a traitor.  I can not agree with ID13018's idea. I regard Edward as his being a hero. Because, I think that the people have to know all the countries.  He is a hero for American citizens. But I think he is a traitor. Because he received a salary from CIA. And the reason why he escapes is that he think I did a bad thing. If he think that I am a hero, he should not run away! I agree with your opinion because the leak of information should not be done.  I think spy is to be in the movie, too. And I agree your pinion that spy will decrease for spreading Internet.  In my opinion, he is a hero because he disclosed the information that American government violates many people's privacy in order to change this corrupt situation, in spite of being exposed to great danger. Maybe various countries do such things but if no one stands up, no one has any question about that and the situation lasts forever. He is one of the few people that have the courage to stop that.  Some people see him as a hero , but I do not so so. Because leaking of classified information is a serious crime especially in America. America is influential country over the world. Therefore the action of Snowden should not be assessed ""hero"" .  I don't think he is a hero. I think every country has some top secrets, so officers shouldn't reveal them. Because it may lose the country's reputation. I want to ask him the reason why he revealed.  I think Edward Snowden is a hero. It is surely bad to steal information of the state secret. However the action uncovered the injustice that the United States performed and announced it to the world, and became an opportunity to let us think about importance of the information and national trust. In addition to it he abandoned a previous living to leak information. For such a reason, I think that his action was right.  I cannot judge whether Edward Snowden is a hero or a traitor. Some people think he is a hero. Others think he is a traitor. Leaking US information is bad thing, but I think this action may be indispensable for the society. Everything has many aspects like this news. Especially, the national matter like this cannot be judged easily.  I think he is a traitor. For some people, what the US government did was shocking, but for others, it could be predicted. These days, there are many surveillance cameras around us and anyone's private information can be accessed. We often open our privacy to a whole world by ourselves such as uploading pictures and writing blogs. In such an information-oriented society, protecting the nation from terrorists could be a right reason to keep watching information. Turning to Edward Snowden, he took out classified information out of the US. His action may expose American citizens to danger. This is the opposite to of the purpose of the US government. That's why I think he is a traitor.  After I read this article, I thought that Snowden is hero. According to the law, the freedom of speech is guaranteed. In addition Snowden is so brave. It is also the condition to be a hero.  I don't agree with the idea that the number of spy will decrease. It is true that most intelligence are gathered by the Internet. However, secret national intelligence couldn't be gathered by the Internet because a lot of governments may be on the watch for cyber attack. I think the most important intelligence might be gathered by human beings.  I don't agree with you. Don't regard this matter as emotional matter. Nobody knows why he leaked the information. , but his actions clearly endangers the US itself. As long as the country has the biggest power around the world, you should care about the bad effect that caused the leak.  No matter how he praised as a hero, no matter how morally right his action was, as a result, it is illegal and he should not bring the classified information out. Some say that what NSA did itself is illegal, but the US court must treat this as ""political question"". In any way, Snowden has no escape, but his action surely arouses public opinion. It must judges what NSA have done.  I am opposed to this opinion. The United States is a leading country in the world. If not all countries are equal, they will not be nice. It is not allowed just because it is a strong country.  I regard Edward Snowden as a traitor. His exposure endangered US people. For example, he exposed that NSA hacked China. This damaged the human rights diplomacy, which US made for China. The relations between US and China are so important for the all countries because two countries have the mighty influence on them in various aspects, such as the military, economy, and politic. Therefore, his act worsened the relations between two countries and endangered not only US people but also all people in the world.  I think he is hero. He leaks secret information of The US . Leaking information is illegal, but that information is unacceptable. By Snowden, we know the way of the US to collect information. However, he can't go back to the US.  I can't agree the opinion. Snowden escaped in several countries, but I think he don't regret leaking. He may be under sentence of death penalty in The US, so he must run away.  I think that he is a hero because he searched a lot of information it is US's secret and unacceptable . I also think that to leak information without being permitted is wrong, but I guess he wanted us to know how US is.  Now, Edward Snowden is the person much talked about, and there are both side which praise him and which blame him. Actually, I don't know about it with many details and whether he is a hero or a traitor. It seem to be a right action, but some says that it put American at risk. However, I respect the way of Snowden's acting. He did it because he believed it right, though it won't be profitable for himself but risky. I can't think of revealing some national important information, but I do want to live with my belief.  I think Edward Snowden is traitor. Edward Snowden leak top secrets of NSA. Certainly, if NSA listened in on EU and China's information, it is illegal. But it is higher politic issue. So this news is controversial now. USA's secret service is not permitted. But Edward Snowden isn't also permitted.  I think Snowden is traitor. Certainly, impeaching with intelligence by CIA has a few good points. But also an obligation to keep official secrets is important for society. I think intelligence by CIA in this case isn't problem that have to impeaching. This impeaching has only bad influence upon America. This impeaching is for him rather than society.  Before I read this article, I didn't know Snowden. So I surprised when I read this article. And I think Snowden is traitor. Because I think there are lots of informations which should be keeped in the world and I think this information is the one which have to be keeped. So I think he is traitor.  I can't agree to this comment completely. Information may be more and more gathered on ""the Internet world"", but the security against this new world must be more and more strengthened. And of course, the secret of each country won't be leaked so easily. So the spy like what they are now will be remained and will continue to have the importance.  I think he is both hero and traitor. Of course he broke the low, and it is absolutely bad thing. But also this age of international society needs the action like him.  I do not know much about this news, however, I think he is a traitor. It is true that his behavior has some positive effects on the US citizen, however he spoiled the US national interest. I guess he is a betrayer. The US government should punish him severely.  I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society.  I agree with ID13023's idea. I also regard Edward as his being a hero. It is because he provided us with information.  I think Snowden is both a traitor and a hero. I don't decide which I should agree. On one side, he broke the low and it is not forgiven as a American citizen. But other side, he is so brave because he leaked it at the risk of his life.  I don't agree with you. Don't regard this matter as emotional matter. Nobody knows why he leaked the information. , but his actions clearly endangers the US itself. As long as the country has the biggest power around the world, you should care about the bad effect that caused the leak.  I think Snowden is a traitor. I can understand he was so brave, but I don't think to leak secret informations of NSA was meaningful. Because, I think his actions threatened the state and citizens. The activities of NSA is for protect the nation from terrorism. Regardless it is justice or not, there are some truth which is better not to know in the world.  As for his action, it would be so careless in terms of his position. maybe it is caused of exposing his nation to danger. I can't praise for his behavior, but I agree with his opinion. According to the news, the embassy was bugged by American government. He probably couldn't excuse such movement. I also think it too exceeding and his action is right.  I think Edward Snowden is a traitor. As he is a member of CIA, he shouldn't leak the information of the nation. CIA has keeped secrets, so U. N. can conduct state affairs smoothly. If the member of a national information betrays the government like him, people in the country will be confused and it can't maintain public order. He should have known the influence of U. N. and been aware of his responsibility as a member of CIA.  I don't think him as a hero, because some international problems can be visible ones due to him. International conflicts can turn into wars, which makes people unhappy. He touched the problems which should be untouched, so I don't agree with you.  I agree with you. He violated the most important principle to keep the secrets as a CIA employee, so we cannot value him high.  I agree with you. Countries must protect its secrets information. Although fundamental human rights should not be ignored, but I think interests of a country is more important because only countries make sure that people live peaceful lives.  Seeing from American government and CIA, he would be a traitor. And in fact, he is a criminal. But I'd like to praise the courage of his that do not care about the risk for the sake of justice.  It is true that Edward Snowden commit a crime, I think he did right thing seeing from moral point. From American view point, his action was guilty. But from Korean and Chinese view point, his action was innocent.  I agree with ID13021 when he says Snowden has caused visible conflicts around the world. It can be said that a gulf has formed between Russia and the US To eliminate unnecessary conflict globally, we should keep some information on our own.  I think that he is a hero. It is a crime surely to steal confidential information. However, Edward who gave the information which should be given to people is a hero. The secret of a country needs to be known by people. So that the secret is large. Edward is brave.  I think Snowden urged us to reconsider. What are information, privacy, national secret. . . ? It's perplexing problem. With the advance of the Internet, the amount of information is increasing and our privacy is decreasing I think. I don't know what is correct and what is important about our privacy and national interests. In this way, I think Snowden is a HERO because we could notice our life are watched by SOMEONE.  I really shocked about this news. This is because the government which need to safe the right of privacy harmed citizens. They harmed citizens right is really annoying thing. I can't imagine that. So this news was really shocking news for me and I can't believe.  I don't agree with you. He is not in a position to leak the nation's information. If U. N. allow him to do it, people who do the same thing will increase. As he broke the low, he should be published.  I cannot agree with his opinion. We cannot judge whether he is a hero or a traitor. It is very difficult matter.  I agree with you. Even the people can get the information that has been secret, the risk of leaking is bigger problem than its advantage.  I disagree with your opinion. Because secrecy of a country should not be leaked in any situations.  snowden should be punished. Even if there are some reasons, it is illegal.  I agree with you. Edward Snowden 's action is right. His action is caused by cruel espionage by American government. Not to expose his nation danger. Recently, American government is chasing him persistently. I want him to run away from them.  I think Snowden is a hero. Certainly he broke the law, but excessive nationalism is bad for people and a accuser is necessary.  I agree with your opinion. I think he is courageous too.  I disagree with your opinion. The laws are not always right.  I agree with the opinion that Snowden is hero. If I stood on his situation, I would choose my safety. I became to have more respect to Snowden after reading this comment.  I think his act was right. It is right that he broke the low but low is not always justice and his decision to leak the information is justice I think. His act saved the ordinary people's safe and the right to know the political things.  I think he is a traitor and criminal. The media report as if he were a great hero - he sacrificed lover and money and steady life for his conscience. But in the first place he violated the law. The people in the US have duty to obey the domestic law. His act can leads to disorder so we cannot value him as a hero.  I agree to your opinion. He violated the law to cause visible conflicts. What he did is not acceptable. A huge disorder may take place in the future because of him, so we cannot praise him as a hero.  I don't agree with you. Whatever the motive is, we must not permit violating laws when seemingly having proper reasons, then the system of legislation would be no longer respectable.  I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking US information but I think that international society also needs those who can do action. It may be caught by the United States, so I want him to escape from the United States. "
JOC JOC-14A-01N -0.59 "Captains have the obligation to help their passengers of their ferry and failing to meet their obligation is the thing which is not accepted. So the thing that the captain of South Korean ferry did is not accepted and he deprived the passengers of South Korean ferry of their lives. The captain and the company must apologize to the passengers and his family, and must explain how the accident happens exactly.  This accident is very bad news. Above all, I feel heat that the captain left passengers in the ship and thought that he saved his own bacon. Certainly, many people would want to be saved at the very beginning if they are in his position. But he accountable to have fall into that circumstance which he had failed steering and the vessel sank, so he was supposed to help passengers preferentially even if he become the last person who board the ship. I'd like to have him become acutely conscious of the captain.  This is one of the most terrible accident that I have ever heard. I hope more people will be rescued. We should never repeat such a tragedy.  I think this is an entirely man-made disaster and this disaster happened because of two reasons. First, the captain lacked a sense of responsibility. I watched the news which says a young conductor died because she had tried to help the ship's passengers instead of the captain who had run away from the wreck. Second, emergency measure wasn't prevailed among the ship's conductors. If the conductors had told the passengers not to stay inside but to run away, more lives was saved. Therefore, I think conductors of transportation need to improve their consciousness of responsibility, because they carry human's lives.  Yesterday, I watched the news about this accident and listen to the unbelievable comment which the captain said. He said that he hurt his hips and he was said ""Get out of the vessel! Hurry up!"" , so he just do as he was said. Moreover, he concealed that he is the captain when he was rescued. I can't believe it! After deserting his passengers, he acted as if he knew nothing about it. And people's dissatisfaction about the government is heightening more and more. I think that the government can't deal with this disaster properly, too. They neglect a training of talented people about duties of protection against disaster and safety. They have to strengthen it immediately. Now, the number of the dead reached 150 and 152 are still missing. I hope that a rescue operation is making fast progress.  I was surprised to hear this news. It may be unavoidable to have caused the accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. According to news, the captain said, ""This ship is safer than any ship. "" Such a reason, It is natural that a captain is blamed. I think those who are doing work which protects people's life should become the most careful. I hope such an occurrence never happens.  When I first heard this news, I felt it was similar to ""Titanic. "" As I knew the details about this disaster, it should be blamed that the captain's sense if responsibility was completely lacked and the Sewol itself was converted in strange way. Also there was no consciousness of safety I think.  Recently, I have heard about this sad news many times on TV, and every time I hear about it, it really made me sad. Among this news, there is something that is bothering me. Korean government refuse Japanese government's help. I know that between Japan and Korea, we are facing a difficult politics problem. However, I think we should help each other under such terrible condition, and that leads better relationship. I hope that many people who are still missing will be rescued, and such a tragedy will never happen again! Recently, I often watch the grieving familys who are crying and shouting on the news. Action the captain took is absolutely unpardonable. It goes without saying. I think measures of South Korean government is bad. They refused support of Japan or America. I don't understand why they didn't accept it. There is no time because the most necessary thing now is to rescue the passengers. I fear search become more serious.  I think this is one of the most tragic disaster. Many of victims are not found now. It make me sad. I'm afraid that this deplorable disaster was forgotten by media and people. I pray that any disaster like this never happen again. So I want not to forgot. Moreover, media all over the world should tell people this accident entirely. This is a very very tragic disaster, but this is a man-made disaster which many people concerned indirectly. The best thing we should do is find the source of trouble.  I watched the news that the disaster like this happened in Japan before. Although in that case there were only 28 passengers in the ship, there were no victims. In Japan's case, the captain of the ship let passengers go on board a helicopter and get on a lifeboat on his own lastly. It is the very best and proper way to be a captain. Korea's captains should follow that Japanese captain and try never to cause a tragic disaster like this time's.  This article made me really sad and I think we have to learn something very important from this. First, we should consider the responsibility of captain. It is true that everyone wants to survive, however, I believe that humanity to others is the most important for us. Therefore, the captain's action in this case is not good. Second, we should consider about what ""safety"" is like. I hear that in Korea, the standard of safety is lower than Japan. For example, it is normal that people don't wear seatbelt in their cars. It is acceptable that there are some differences between the countries, but I think we need to learn from another country. In this case, if Korean standard of safety had been higher, this terrible accident might not have happened. Therefore, I think Korean government have to change and look over rules again soon.  At first, I was surprised and even felt angry at the captain's irresponsibility. But now, I think that, in a way, It cannot be helped. Even though he had the duty to rescue all passengers, it may require so much of courage as one cannot gather. Of course, the act that he did is unacceptable. However, it should be taken into consideration that, like many people, he is a man who is weak and afraid of death. Anyway, I can't do nothing but hope that such a disaster will never happen and the captain will be judged and sentenced legally.  South Korean government and the company managing the Sewol must have prevented this accident. If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so serious as it is. This accident has caused widespread panic in South Korea and other countries. Moreover, the company has lost prestige. I think I won't ride ships possessed by this company. All I can do for victims is praying for them and thinking deeply about preventing recurrence of this accident. I feel irritated that I can do almost nothing for victims. Nevertheless, I hope there are survivors in the ship.  If my family or friends met with a accident like this news, I would get angry for a captain and grieve for them. And if I were the grieving families, I could not forgive the captain's action and existence. It is regrettable that the accident occurred. I think of victims and their family and friends, I'm very sorry about it. Although the captain's action was certainly criticized, I think taking place of his condition, he would also been terrified and want to live. I understand his feeling about that, but I would like to tell him, ""you must understand that all passengers had the same feeling of you. They put their life in your hand, and how many people hope do your best for them and be saved. ""All captains of vessels and pilots of airplanes think the news, and should image the worst case. And they must think If worst comes to worst, what they should do or can do. They must not forget a sense of responsibility about having passenger's lifes. I hope such a accident never happen again.  What will you do if a captain of your ferry escaped without telling the situation?Almost all of the people will do nothing under the situation. The captain of South Korean ferry took a mistake which made us sad. His lack of responsibility for saving his passengers aroused my anger. If it was true that he escaped earlier than anyone else, I could not believe this action. It is natural for a captain to saving the lives of people to the last. This accident had us to be anxiety of going by ship. I often use a ship and an airplane when I take a trip. If my family or friends were involved in such a accident, I would get angry for a captain of the ferry. This is two times that big accidents which makes us sad. I wish these accidents which killed many people never happen forever. It is because that a ship and an airplane is surely need to take a trip.  The captain's act is not acceptable. However I can understand his feelings. If I had been in his position, I would have left passengers like him. Putting passenger's lives before his own life is very courageous and difficult, but since he was a captain, he had a responsibility to do that. I learned I can't be a captain from this news.  Firstly , I offer condolences on the victims of the accident. Many people who are as young as me are still missing. I wish they will be discovered. It is unbelievable to me that captain escaped from the ferry. Captains of ships are responsible for them. So they have to lead the passengers to escape. But he raced to get away without a thought for anyone else. I want to ride the ferry which is capsized by reliable person. I hope for captain's sense of responsibility.  I think this is one of most tragic disaster. A lot of people have not rescued yet. when I think about feelings of the bereaved, it feels me hurt and makes me sad. The problem is a captain responsibility and sloppy administration. I think we should be never happen like this accident anymore.  When I got the whole story of this accident, I felt sad and infuriated. This is not just an accident but a tragedy caused by slipshod management system of company operating the ferry. If a junior officer had not taken helm, this accident would not have happened. If the captain of the ferry had evacuated passengers, it would not have brought many deaths. However, Nothing comes out of just criticizing. They should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible.  This news made me sad, since many people including high school students , who are coeval with me, died. Furthermore the most having made me sad is that this accident was a man-made disaster. The captain escaped more foremost than anyone else and alerted people on board no precautions against the ship careening. If crews had promoted more awareness and evacuated the passengers with feeling of responsibility, more people could have last out. Through this accident, we learned many lessons. As one of the lessons, many companies should give their employees training on safety as necessary harder than before. By enforcing safety standards, I hope that accidents by human mistake will have never occurred.  Reading this article, my first impression to the captain of the vessel was very bad. Of course , it is true that every man is always afraid of his death but as the captain, he was responsible for all the passengers. So, to him, it should have been the last thing to leave the vessel. From the bottom of my heart, I hope the captain and his crew will be sentenced strictly.  The captain of the South Korean ferry should not be allowed to practice as a detective. Captains have a duty to save passengers. However, this captain put priority on himself. I think everyone should take pride in and responsibility for theirs work. Also, there is another problem. The problem is the speed of investigation. When it comes to the saving of a life, the speed is the most important. Of course, South Korea is an advanced country, on the other hand, there is no end of troubles. From this point of view, South Korea is condemned. Then, I think Japan not only criticize South Korea but regard South Korea as a country from whose bad example one can learn.  This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  I can't understand why the captain and his crew jumped into a rescue boat and remind his passengers in the ferry. They should have given instruction to his passengers could move to a safer area. The captain have to take a serious view of passengers' life. Also Korean government neglected countermeasures. I think this disaster could keep off if there were proper countermeasures. I hope such disaster never happen in the future.  This news is really sad. 187 people were killed in the accident, and 115 people are still missing. I ached at the sad news. I felt angry about the captain's action. He was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. These are the action that a captain must not do. If he had acted responsibly as a captain, more people might have escaped death. We must not occur an accident like this again. I pray for the safety of missing people.  I felt sad when I read this news. A lot of people passed away and their family got angry so much about the captain who jumped into a rescue boat though there were many passengers in the ship. I also think he was irresponsible. In my opinion, the captain of the ship should not leave it until all the passengers are rescued. If he don't make the promise, we cannot be relieved when we take a ship.  This news made me shocked and sad, because so many high school students who were as young as me were killed by this accident. If only the captain had attempted to rescue them. . . When I attended a class of Korean language few days ago, I ask teacher who is from Korea opinion concerning this accident. She said""This accident is not only excruciating but also too shameful as Korean to refer to anymore. Also, if you feel uncomfortable when you see pictures of screaming bereaved , I want you to understand their pain. "" I think this accident involved the problem about responsibilities of leaders in every organization.  When I read the article, I felt great angry for the captain. That's because he gave up to rescue his passengers and deserted them in order to survive himself alone. Perhaps, hundreds were still in the water at that time, wanting to be rescued. If the captain has had normal character and advised the passengers to evacuate properly, many of innocent lives wouldn't die. In addition, according the article, almost victims are high school students. All of them had hopeful future, but now have grieving families. Therefore, it is no exaggeration that the captain's stupid act deprived students of their infinite potential. Sincerely, I hope such a terrible accident never happens.  When I heard this news, I was so sad. First, many people were killed in this accident. Especially it was the news that was very sad for me that a high school student was in an accident during a school excursion. It is a very disappointing thing that a young person dies. Second, the captain's action made us get angry. It was an action without a sense of responsibility. I think that I want the crew of the ship to compensate for a crime well. This news made us consider many point. I hope that such a thing never happens.  I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. I think he wanted to be alive when the accident happened. If I face it, I would think so. However, he was the captain of the ferry which carried hundreds of people, so he had a responsibility to save their lives, but he neglected it. It is only natural that he is condemned. We should convey such a tragic accident to coming generation in order that we never forget it and it never happen.  I think this accident may be an example of Korean's problems. It's because this accident is caused by persons, for example, the captain of this ferry didn't operate the ferry. In fact, the most problem is Korean's society!! when the ferry was sinking, a student in the ferry called Republic of Korea Coast Guard(RKCG) to help people in the ferry. But, RKCG couldn't distinguish the call from a call from the captain. This example shows Korean's flaw most, that is, Korean government cannot respond to an issue in case of emergency.  I think that the captain should have dealt with this accident as a captain. He should have been responsible for passengers' lives . I regard a lot of criticism as quite natural. This accident took a heavy toll of human lives. If the crew had listened to the voices of conscience, this accident could have been avoided. We need to learn from and act on the lessons of this accident. We have to conduct an investigation in order to know this background. We need to uncover the reason why the crew neglected their duties.  This news made me sad. That many of the hundreds passengers were high school students is deplorable. In addition, I feel great sorrow in that many passengers still have been in the sea. I hope that people still missing will be found and bodies will return to their family. But, above all, I got angry with the captain who had jumped into a rescue boat leaving his passengers in the wreck. If he had given accurate information and instruction to them, more people would have been saved.  I can't help sympathizing with grieving families when I heard this news. I think the captain's crime was too cruel to be forgiven. Also, I found very interesting thing in this article. If this accident happened in Japan, we would criticize not only a captain, but also a company which employs him. It is because we think the company has a responsibility to train employees. I hope more victims would be saved from the ferry.  This news made me think a lot of things, the responsibility for work, the feelings of the bereaved, the importance of our life etc. In terms of the bereaved, of course I can understand the criticism for the captain. But I also think every life is equally important. The captain also had his family and maybe had the reason why he have to live. If the captain had been dead when the accident had occurred, perhaps he would be a hero now, but isn't it just our ideal? If you were the captain at the situation, can you choice the death while you have a lot of important things? I felt it is so difficult to think of the balance between the responsibility for work and life equality.  The problem of this article is responsibility of the captain, but I think that the company's education is more important. It is true that the South Korean ferry captain did an irreparable thing, however, it is also the responsibility of company. Company have to employ people with sense of strong responsibility and educate strictly. The problem of the Malaysian Airlines flight 370 occurred because of management of company wasn't strict. So I think company have to have strong responsibility.  I sympathized with victim's family, and also felt angry to Lee Joon-Seok, his crew and people who loaded too much. I think that if Lee steered ship and cargos were loaded too much, the Sewol didn't sink. So Korean government should check supervision system of ship.  First, When I herd this news, it caused me much pain. I think all of the captains must be responsible for rider's life, but the captain didn't carry out in the responsible manner. This accident may be significant to consider about responsibilities which professional seamen have. Not limited to this, other professionals like sailors and pilots (Malaysian Airlines flight 370 mystery too) have to be conscious of impotence of life.  I was shocked about this news. I cannot understand why captain jumped into the sea without helping passengers still in the ship. Becoming a captain means he has a high position in the ship and also has all responsibilities of the ship and lives of all passengers who use the ship. I think there is more important things than earning money and fame.  I feel sad to hear this news. I think a lot of people can't understand this accident in detail. So I hope Korean government expose information for this news as soon as possible.  I was shocked at this news, for most of the people who were killed in this accident were high school students. The captain of the ferry should have remained there and given directions to passengers. We must understand what is a problem of this accident and try hard not to make such mistakes again.  I think that it is very sad story. If I were a student who take the ship, I would regret choosing the ship, and if I were the bereaved family, I would regret seeing my son or daughter off. This is not just an affair of other people, and all the countries of the world should be care of their countries safety for a nation.  This is one of the most tragic disaster that I have ever heard. It is a very unfortunate accident. There is a strong possibility of the case that I will be involved in such a miserable accident. So I think I must spend meaningful days in order not to have any regrets.  To hear that news, I was very surprised and sad. This is because the captain of that ferry who should have been left in the ferry jumped into a rescue boat early and abandoned many passengers and his crew . If he had remained, a lot of people would have been saved . Now, all I can do is hope that missing people will be saved. Moreover, the captain must explain this accident and do what is good for the bereaved families.  the captain had to have one choice in two choices, to save himself or to save his passengers, in this case. Of course, he has to save his passengers as the captain of this ferry. But if you are the captain then, what do you do? Do you blame him the same again? I guess he imagined the severe life after going back to Korea. But he thought to live as a criminal is better than to die. Not only us but also himself had the pretty sad. I hope to rescue the left passengers as soon as possible.  Nowadays, we see a lot of newses like this. I'm afraid of the fact that the public transportation is not actually safe unless we believe so. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him. The public transportations should take enough care about their safety and we always have to prepare for the accident so that we can react immediately.  At first, I got angry at what this captain did and feel sorry that many passengers are still missing;( However, I realize that I can't know what happened at the moment because I know the details about the accident only by mass media. I suppose we mustn't accept whatever we read in the newspapers and on the Internet without thinking by ourselves.  I am agreement at your opinion. I also feel anger for the persons involved in this incident. However, when there were few cargoes, didn't the incident occur? It may also be a fact that surely there are many cargoes and operation of a ship has become inconvenient. But, I think that the first problem is a captain's action. So, I think that the incident had occurred even if there were few cargoes.  I think so. Those who have a responsibility has to consider others. The captain didn't think about the passengers. They believe the crews, but they betray them. I forgive what they did.  I think so too. The captain must be subject to punishment. And I think the impact of mass media is large. I pray they rest in peace.  I have a same feeling about this news. I also want a matter due to the luck of captain's responsibility does not happened again. I think the captain of his passengers should save their lives. Otherwise, we will not use public transportation from now. Therefore, I want people not to forget a matter like this.  I completely agree to your opinion. Actually, I thought that the news was similar to the Titanic, but the difference between them is ""season"" the accident occurred. In Korean case, if the passengers had jumped into the sea, they would be alive. The captain should have more responsibility all the more because people who can be rescued died.  I think it's exactly as you say. The captain and crews of Sewol, Republic of Korea Coast Guard and the Korean Government was irresponsible and very loose. So the more they had sense of responsibility, the less people died of the Sewol tragedy, I think. And I think too that Korea should retrain the responsibility and consciousness of government employees and the crews.  I think that I cannot necessarily blame only a captain. It is a very difficult thing to make a calm decision at the point of death. However, I cannot forgive a captain. It is the problem that is not easy to treat.  I always watch TV that The president of South Korea pursuits the issue. But is it top priority for her?I don't think so. She should put stress the right of life of people. Why did she send the limited number of a rescue party?She thinks lightly of lives. Japanese navy and Air Force can have gone to save many people. Because Japanese Forces is in Sasebo near Korea. And she should have asked Japan to do so. Maybe her pride prevents from asking.  I think so. A captain of ferry has a task which is saving passengers' lives. If an accident happens, he must do this and prioritize saving passengers. He who jumped into a rescue boat without saving is far from being a captain. I find that I am not cut out to be a captain, too.  I agree with you. But, it is also dangerous to try diving in the ocean before a ship capsizing. There are as many dangerous things in the ocean as in a sinking ship. So, all we can do to prevent such cruel accident from occurring again is to improve all drivers security awareness and ethics.  I felt the same thing. The worst was captain who didn't evacuate passengers. But only blaming him is good for nothing anymore. I guess they should review their safe control.  I agree with Your comment. -- ""If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so It approves of the opinion serious as it is. "" I think that the crew lacked the simulation and knowledge of the troubleshooting. The captain said later, ""It was considered When the accident, I could not think anything excepting how to I will be able to live. "" It is because the captain was not able to assume such a miserable accident. Probably, his head has filled then. Nobody should not forget that there is a danger of the accident. For that purpose, a detailed text book and training of fire drill are required.  I was surprised to hear this news. This accident is one of the most terrible accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. I think that captain should have responsibility to the passenger's lives and the government should impose a severe punishment on the captain.  When I read this article, the ferry's captain is cruel man because he acted as murder. captain should be bold and kind, but he is a chicken. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him.  When I read this article, I was so sad and hope that the ferry's captain change himself. He must be punished and we should do many many things by the such thing happen next time. For example, we should restrict captain's license.  I strongly agree with you. You said that they should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible. It is true that we should not forget this tragedy. However, all we have to do is make a new crisis management system in order not to occur such a tragedy repeatedly. They need a personnel cut. To do so, workers who was responsible for this accident should be punished and fired. Furthermore, we make them change an atmosphere in this company.  I think so. Of course I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. He should have helped hundreds of people instead of himself.  This is true that the captain responsible to this accident. But a people should think seriously why this accident happened.  When I read this news , I felt so sad because many people were killed by this tragedy . Also , I got angry with the captain of this ferry . It is crazy thing to escape from the ferry when the accident happened .  This is very sad news. Certainly, the captain is to be held responsible by the bereaved family. But, I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  Don't you want get on the ferry of the captain who has no responsibility for our lives? If we were passengers of the ferry, we would choose to save our own lives. However, the action of a captain is most important problem in the accident. Therefore, if we were the captains of the ferry, what we would do? If I were the captain, I would choose to save passenger's life first.  I was very shocked to hear this news. I knew an irresponsible person like him for the first time. I am very regrettable that many men and women of the age that is about the same as me died because of him. I think that person in charge must have a serious sense of responsibility by all means. And we must not forget this affair.  When I knew this news, I am high school student. Many Korean high school students were died by this accident. So I am shocked. I think captain should have helped to passenger. But he was escaped from Sewol. I was disappointed of it. "
JOC JOC-14A-03N -0.98 "When I read this article for the first time, I forgot myself in anger. Of course it is true that criminals should be punished by legal means, but they don't have to be in more agony than they have to atone for the crime they committed. I think the development of medical science should be used to ease humans' pains. We have to think more seriously about this problem because this problem is a matter of all people in the world. I suppose we should respect more for the rights of criminals and make better use of medical science to make all people happy.  The way the US execute criminals is as same as cruel torture. This execution is against the principle of the constitutional states. The principle says Criminals are punished because they disturb their societies' peace and order. Therefore punishments including death penalty are not carried out in order to inflict pains on prisoners. The us are needed to carry out the death sentences in safer and less grotesque way. In the way, I was surprised that condemned criminals are killed by drugs in the US. In Japan condemned criminals are hanged. I think it is interesting in the way of death penalties.  I was feeling keenly that killing by chemicals is a pretty cruel thing. I disagree with killing animals in pharmaceuticals. I have a dog, so it is unbearable that animals are sent to the health center by having discarded by owner and would be killed eventually, using such as gas or injection. Lethal injection, which exists as one of executions, I was well understood that the death-row prisoner writhed in agony pain and dead by reading this article. I think it is terrible that the process which a lethal injection had failed and the prisoner dead. However, I think that it's inevitable that the wrongdoer was suffering from lethal injections when we put ourselves in the victim's place.  Capital punishment is, in principle, done as a warning of other would-be criminals, and I think that the nation's attitude to treat criminals according to the weight of their crimes cannot be criticized. However, too much cruelness make the nation's reputation and confidence lost. I think that the current way the US carry out the execution is so humane that it should adopt new and more humane way of the penalty.  I cannot believe that the drug of using animals uses humans to execute capital punishment. This is because the injection may fail to work. The way of executing should use more humane and less prone to error. However, I think it is natural that a criminal feel the pain as the injured. Capital punishments need for criminal to atone for what he did. Using three drugs is more dangerous than using one drug. Therefore, if they use three drugs, they succeed in injecting absolutely. We should consider carefully about it.  When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished. It is true that criminals are should be punished. But a false charge may always happen and recovery does not attach it after a capital punishment. Therefore, I think that the capital punishment itself should be abolished, before considering the method of a death penalty.  When I read the article, first I think people who should be executed capital punishment take a pain is proper thing. But, every criminal is person, so they have human right. And when they are suffering from drugs , some executioner also suffering from their groaning. Their stress is so terrible. Just considering the two side , I think one drug to carry out lethal injections are better than three drugs caused acute pain. But, using some drugs and executing people are last method. So before we think what kind of drug we use, we should take it more seriously about the fact that we kill the person however he committed murder.  The story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is very horrible for me. No matter how terrible crime he committed, he has human right. I think the way of execution should be decided by criminals.  I think that the death penalty should be abolished. Why do we need death penalty? People who back death penalty are very illogical. First, killing people is very cruel especially execute someone by lethal injection. Second, life imprisonment has deterrent against crime in common with death penalty. In conclusion, there is no necessity to carry out death penalty.  When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised at Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett. I knew that very cruel thing such as this execution was carried out actually for the first time by reading this article and I felt a sadness and a fear. The three drug method just causes a person too much pain, hurts people's feeling and gives people emptiness. I think this is a too cruel torture and no one come to be happy by it.  This news made me sad. In the first place, there is still a discussion about morality of capital punishment. Because death penalty might violate human rights. In the way, Amnesty International is doing anti death penalty activity. In addition to this conflict, the matters about cruel torture may infringe on human rights more and more. Even if men who are punished are heinous criminal , they are human. So as long as the human rights are protected in constitution, they should be treated as honorable person. Thus if we agree with death penalty, we should activate the discussion about the way criminal are punished.  When I read this article, I was very surprised and shocked. At the same time, I felt this was a very serious problem. Although I don't have enough knowledge of drug, I thought we all have to try something we can do to solve the problem because this is very important matter for all of us. I think execution by the three drug method is too strict for people however bad the criminal is. Therefore, I feel we should reconsider this kind of penalty seriously. Furthermore, I thought that I have to learn about law harder and harder in the university and I want to have more knowledge about execution.  When I read this article, I was surprised very much. It is surely that the person who committed a crime receives a punishment. However, using three-drug method is too terrible. All over the world, capital punishment exists today. But, because a prisoner has human rights, not the death penalty, I think that the we should give different punishment. In any case, we learn about a law seriously and should think it.  When I read this article, I felt that I was fierce. The Clayton rocket of Oklahoma has human rights as one human being, too. Therefore, in this matter, I think that it was an opportunity to change a thought about the death penalty. Presence and the human rights of the death penalty are very difficult problems. However, the death penalty such as the torture cannot be necessary.  I didn't realize capital punishment was unbearable pain. Although Clayton rocket committed an inadmissible crime, the way he was killed is too cruel. We should think again about capital punishment. Because modern medicine and technology are developing, we can introduce better way of death. I don't think the death penalty should be abolished, but administration of justice need execute it after considering human rights.  When I read this article, I was very surprised with that the official had allowed to use the untested drug. Although I don't think we should abolish the capital punishment, we must recognize prisoners as human. They have some rights as we have. So, we take care of them humanly. Some people say ""They are in prison because they killed someone or used drugs. So, it is quite natural that their rights are ignored. ""Although I can understand what they say and I have the same feeling somewhere in my mind, I think they are totally wrong. As long as we live, every of us should be recognized as a member of a society I was surprised to hear that, in the United States, it ie allowed to execute death row inmates with drugs, in the first place. In Japan, drugs aren't used in execution. I wonder why the US take that way, and why they use drugs that banned from using to euthanize animals. To me, it sounds like humans are inferior to other animals. It is true that humans isn't superior to other animals in any way and that it is important to treasure them. However, humans are valuable, too. We should confirm that and reconsider the system of executing in the US.  When I read this article, I was really surprised. Clayton Lockett killed people and raped women. So, he must make up his crimes. However, he has human rights, and no one can deprive of his human rights. The accident is too cruel treatment for him. I think that the US should stop using drugs to execute death sentences, because cruel accident like this must never happen again.  I don't agree with execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals. Certainly, criminals have to suffer punishments and victims desire it. However, punishments with illegal drugs go against humanity. We should take a serious view of humanity and think how they can correct errors.  I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned. I am in favor of death penalty. Because some situation should do death penalty. But I think if they do death penalty, it must be quickly and it must not be painful. So, I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned.  After reading this article, I felt that the execution of Clayton Lockett was so cruel that I cannot agree with using the three drug method. He was very guilty , however, this execution like torture had an ethical problem. So I suggest that we should not use that drug.  I think this article is issue of natural right which a condemned criminal has. I disagree with using lethal injection. Because, we must not treat life lightly, even so, it is a condemned criminal's life. I have two reasons. First, if the drug fails to work properly, he die with suffering. Drug lethal injections have a high risk. Second, this drug may be smuggled over. For the reasons, I disagree with using lethal injections.  When I was read this article, I was surprised that it is allowed to use drugs for execution in the US despite the fact that this way can cause acute pain and lead to grotesque scenes. I think it is unnecessary for people who commit crimes to give pain. I know it is natural that the criminals commit crimes, they should be punished. However they have human rights, we have to make allowance for them. I think execution using drugs should be abolished because of such reasons.  I think people who committed sins need to be punished in any way. But it is nothing to say that they are ""people"" as same as us so we have to consider their fundamental human rights. Especially capital punishment is a disputable point. In my opinion, I don't disagree with capital punishment. This institution could restrain brutal crime. However, we must more care about the way. We mustn't occur the worst case , terrible process which a lethal injection fails.  When I read this article, I can't believe this execution about using drugs. I had thought that using drugs are banned all over the world. However, I can't agree drugs uses lawfully in some situation. In order to solve this problem, I hope drugs would disappear in the world.  I thought it a good way that we use a drug to kill a criminal, but I changed my mind. I think it a bad way. it is because it is cruel for us to use a drug. Rather than killing people immediately, using a drug makes people feel pain before their dead. It is true that using a drug does away with making persons kill a criminal with their hands such as push a button to kill a criminal. But using a drug makes them see a situation that a criminal feels pain. It makes persons uncomfortable, and they go mad, if they see the situation too much. For the reason, I think that we should not use a drug to kill a criminal.  Recently, capital punishment is greatly debated. The point is usually its morality , whether to do away with. At any rate, we should hold human life in high esteem. Even death-row inmates are human, so their rights should be respected. Therefore, I think that employment of capital punishment should be sedate and easy for them.  I think using the drug administered to the death penalty is a bad thing because Mr. Dennis and Rocket died given the suffering and punishment beyond their crime, and pain. I think that this is not good ethically. There are two reasons. First, the most of effect of current drag is uncertain. Second supposing medicinal medication goes wrong, The family who are looking will be a lot of shocked. The right explanation is given before using. But given the science and technology of today, we should refrain from the use of the drag for death penalty.  There are a lot of comments that say""It is morally bad to execute people by using drug cocktail""I presume that this theme is very interesting. In my opinion, I think so too. It is true that an offender should be punished , but that should not be capital punishment by using drugs. That measure would give them more pain than what they did. But I think capital punishment is needed. Because, I think that capital punishments deter crime. So we have to change the way to execute.  When I read this article, I had mixed feelings. I think euthanasia is not necessarily bad, cause we should have the right to chose our ends (I don't approve of the idea entirely, thought). But, If we make the choice by drugs, we have to examine many times before using them. We cannot examine it with people, so we will use animals. It is the same thing for death penalty by drugs. We have to avoid the problem like Clayton Lockett. However, we should think about the right of animals at the same time. It is the so difficult matter.  When I read this article, I was surprised and shocked. Of course, Clayton Lockett must be punished for the crime of killing people. However I think that he shouldn't be executed in a way that ignores human rights. He is a human too. Should he have died struggling? But If I were a relative of the victim, I wouldn't say the same things.  I was shocked to hear the news. A criminal is also a human being, so his life should have been treated more carefully. This is not my opinion, but from Christian point of view, it is said equality under god. Also, in this accident, lethal injection was untested. So to speak, he was a testing bench. Even though he was a condemned criminal, his life was only one time and I thought his last should have been calmness.  When I read the article, it made me surprise and I felt so sad. Before reading the article, I was for execution by using drug, because in terms of criminal's human rights, I thought this method seemed to be better than shooting or hanging. However, considering the terrible case, I changed my mind. Using drug is no less cruel than shooting or hanging. Apart from the problem whether or not we should abolish death penalty, we have to reconsider the method of execution.  Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs because I thought the criminals could die in piece and with no pain by this method. However, my feeling toward it had totally changed. It can be as cruel as other methods such as hanging. Most of us the Japanese are for with the idea of capital punishment, but maybe we should reconsider whether we should adopt it or not.  At first I think it is a humane way to execute inmates with drugs. But as I read this article, I noticed that there is a possibility of being cruel and precarious. Though Clayton Lockett is a criminal, his human right should be defended, I think.  I think using drug like lethal injections for execution is humanitarian, but this situation is not. Actually It is sure that Clayton Lockett committed serious crime. No matter haw he is brutal criminal, he is a human and has human rights. And it should be defended.  I think this news shows how indifferent to other's life we are . I agree with execute inmates with drugs if a condemned criminal can die without pain. However, in fact, we treat their life carelessly. We should improve our consciousness about other human's life.  Before reading this article , I thought that using drug for execute criminals is good in terms of human right. However, after reading it , I came to think that we should stop execute or find other ways to execute . Of course, criminals are bad and punished, but they also have human rights . we should respect them for protecting our human rights It's surprising for me to be different between way of execute in US and EU. But I'm convinced that it's natural to be different. For many things are different around the world. But I think Clayton's matter is crucial. He killed a girl so it's natural for him to be stated death penalty. I think he wasn't have to dead suffering. So we should work out a way of execute.  I felt sorry for Clayton Lockett when I read this news. It is true that the crime that he committed is too cruel. However, nobody had the rights to give him unjust heavy pain in this country governed by law. I am for capital punishments, but I believe that we can respect for the criminals to some extent when he is executed.  The famous artist was arrested by drug possession yesterday. i often hear the news caught in drug possession I have the experience which actually refused the drug. It takes courage to refuse a drug. However, it is an important thing In order to keep its own body and the future. . .  I felt sad to read this news and remembered the Nazis. I think the execution of Clayton Lockett is impossible because it infringe his humanity. He killed people, indeed, but it doesn't mean losing his humanity. What I was most surprised at is that officials have allowed this execution. Criminal law of U. S is different from that of Japan, but I think humanity should be saved in all countries. So the death penalty must be abolished.  I agree your opinion. As I thought it is cruel thing that killing condemned criminals using three chemicals. But I also there is no help for it because the criminal constituted that much serious crime. We should consider how to execute in order not to be too terrible while we incorporate and opinion from a point of jurisprudence view.  I agree with your opinion. We should think carefully about using some drugs, because it cause acute pain and deprive criminals' human rights easily.  I don't agree with you. I can't take forever to decide a way to die. This decision is very cruel. The death penalty should be abolished completely. It is the best way to protect of human right.  I agree with you. The most basic human rights are treated apart from careers, characters and so on. I think that they are absolute and must be secured for every humans all over the world.  I don't agree with you. I think it is necessary for a criminal like him to execute. This is because if there is no capital punishment, a criminal will increase. And you said his life was only one time, but it's unfair that he isn't executed instead of having murdered. However he shouldn't be killed like a torture since he has human rights and it's against ethic. This idea is the same as you.  I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed.  I agree with your opinion. We should use science for human's benefit even if the receiver is criminal.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish death penalty. Life can't return after death. miss judgment may occur.  I do not agree with you. I don't think that the countries governed by law should allow criminals to decide the way of execution. The way of execution should not change by feelings of criminals.  I agree with you. Of course, criminals should be punished in some way. but that shouldn't be capital punishment. Capital punishment has a lot of fault. For example, If we execute someone by accident, we can't resuscitate him or her. So we have to abolish the practice of capital punishment.  I agree with your opinion. I think human right is equal. Execution is not right for dignity I agree with her opinion because I think she understands the danger of drug.  First, I was very very surprised at this news. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. I think EU should export drugs for capital punishment to the U. S because the death penalty is legal in the U. S and drugs from EU are necessary for smooth execution. By doing so , the U. S don't need to use the three drug method but can use the one-drug method and as a result, smooth execution will be realized, I think.  I agree with this comment. There are many different points around the world. For example, food, clothes, greeting, courtesy, and so on. This is a matter of course, but there is one thing to be common to all, importance of human life. No matter how different their culture is, human life should be treated carefully.  The medical law is not organized very well. The situation is very similar in Japan. American should obey the law. Also, they should confirm the existence and importance of the medical law. But the problem is there is not unified code. I think the code is necessary in this modern society. In this code, they should establish the rights of those who is performed medical treatments and even those who is imposed death penalties by drugs. By this code , although it is innovative and lawyers and jurists don't claim the code is legitimated, people can change the relationship between those who perform and those who is performed fundamentally.  When I read this article, I was really surprised. Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs. Now, however, I think the death penalty must be abolished.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. I think capital punishment is necessary. But using three drugs is not humane. They are criminals, truly. However, they are humans too. So we should think better of it.  Death penalties should be banned quickly. In Japan capital punishments have been executed for a long time. As the opinion of the minority, They think because constitution in Japan says ""The infliction of torture by any public officer and cruel punishments are absolutely forbidden"", putting somebody to death should be stopped. In this article, person which passed death sentence was treated badly. I think it can't be the doing of a man in his senses.  I disagree with you. Because an alternative penalty of capital punishment must be a life sentence. But people don't bear living in a prison whole life. And most of death penalties result in prisoners being overwhelmed and become crazy. So we certainly respect the rights of life of people, by abolishing death penalty, also we violate the personal rights. Therefore, I think we mustn't abolish death penalty. And we introduce a life sentence. And prisoners can choose which sentence should be executed. It is related to not only the criminal law the medical law, such as the problem of euthanasia.  I almost agree with you. Capital punishment should be abolished. Present science technology and court system are insufficient for performing a death penalty. But, we must not forget that death punishment becomes a deterrent of a big crime at the present time.  I think we should not say easily that death penalty is bad or it should be baned. It is because death penalty work as prevention not to commit a felony which sentence a person to death. It is sure that people must respect one's freedom to live. However, ie there is no death penalty, terrible accident would increase. So I think death penalty is better than increasing a lot of terrible crime.  I was surprised that America uses chemicals to do executions and sometimes they lead grotesque scenes. Japan has hanging for death penalty and these ways of capital punishment are both cruel, so I think that we must think more kind way of death penalty.  When I heard this news, I was very surprised. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. Japan has death penalty too. We should consider about this problem.  I think so, too. Although they killed men, they have human rights. So we should respect their human rights. We should make a low which they can respect ones.  I think it is important to adopt new and more humane way of the penalty, but finally we should aim at the society which don't have any death penalty.  I think so too, because if there is no death penalty, terrible crime may increase. However, I think it isn't best execution. So, we need to reconsider the method of execution.  When I read this article. I was so sad and we should not occur such thing. Death penalty must be banned quickly from all over the world. That is because it is not compensation.  I don't agree with you. I think that death penalty is needed to all over the world.  I agree with you. I think we have little knowledge of drugs. So we should learn about drugs. If we do so, drugs won't be used carelessly.  Death penalty may not be compensation and rights of criminals condemned to death may not be respected, but criminals did victims harm very much. Criminals robbed victims of rights-to-life and made many people sad. So I think Death penalty is needed.  I have a counterargument in your opinion. It approves of your opinion of the first half. I thought that this incident was shocking. However, I think that your idea of ""deciding a punishment by the person's crime"" is not good. The weight of people's life is not compared. The weight of a punishment is not compared strictly, either. A punishment should not be changed with criminal importance, but a death penalty with medicine should be abolished. I assert abolition of capital punishment.  We must explore the way of euthanasia for a death penalty. Condemned criminals are cruel but I think we do not need to let them feel pain when they die.  I strongly disagree with your opinion. It is because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it were a murder. So I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment.  I agree with you. I think execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals is not good.  I think death penalty should be abolished and I fear drug being used to punish criminals. I feel using drug to kill animals will lead to using drug to kill criminals some day.  I think so too.  I think the story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is so horrible and cruel . To be sure , he committed crime but he is one person and he has human rights . So this news shocked me .  I think death penalty should not be abolished but I think using drug to kill animals is bad thing too .  I am opposed his opinion. Although he asserts the abolition of capital punishment. If a convict says why a death penalty is used, I will be because the crime of only that was committed and will think how it is that asserts only the protection of human rights.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish the capital punishment. I also have heard the death penalty costs a large sum of money. I think it is not necessary to spend much money on the death penalty. I think that anyone who perpetrates a crime should be treated one of the human beings.  I strongly disagree with your opinion. I do not think that we should abolish capital punishment because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it is a murder. I think it is strange. So, I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment.  I also believe that the death penalty should be banned. Everyone, even murderers, has human right. Even the court shouldn't let anyone die even they committed something terrible.  I agree with your opinion. I think human rights are all same. Execution is not right for punishment.  I think that capital punishment is culture. People will be rewarded if he commit the crime which should be carried out death. Seeing historically, the death penalty existed from ancient times considerably. Japanese people think that we should not stop capital punishment for the reason other countries do not accept a death penalty. we should have an opportunity to discuss on humane grounds.  I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed I strongly disagree with you. I believe capital punishment should be abolished as soon as possible, because everyone has the fundamental human right and no one should not invade the right. "
JOC JOC-14B-06N -0.12 "It is more trouble to many people than it is worth that songs are automatically downloaded even if they are free. I think that iTunes users gripe is quite natural because the record took up valuable iPhone storage space of them. I am troubled about that I don't have enough iPhone and PC storage space now, so if same thing happen to me, I won't feel good.  The incident is very impressive for me. When the U2's album was released for free on the internet , I was signed in iTunes. So the album was downloaded arbitrarily in my music application. As I didn't know that U2's album, I was very surprised the downloading and scared. I thought my account was taken over and some is impersonating my account user. My family became very anxious and searched how change the password of my account. Then we understood the downloading was done by Apple, so we felt relieved and got angry the download. I think it's good that U2 released the album for free, but I don't want to be downloaded arbitrarily even if the commercial are done.  When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because I had signed in iTunes two days ago. I checked my iTunes at once and knew that U2's album hadn't been downloaded on my iTunes. If U2's album had been downloaded on my iTunes, I would have been anxious about a computer virus. And also I would have been unpleasant because my valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in. I couldn't forgive Apple and U2 if this accident had been scheme in collaboration.  I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes. But I do not think this causes such a big problem in the world. In the way, I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Because If apple had already make choices weather iTunes customer get U2's album for free or not, many iTunes customers have not been complained. In fact, U2 is the known and popular rock band. Nonetheless, there are many people who have not been interested in U2. For me, I had not known U2 until I read this article. Therefore, apple had to consider various people's needs.  I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. I do not use iTunes because I don't have iPods nor iPhones. Thus I do not know the system of iTunes in detail, but I knew that, to add musics of iTunes to Podcasts, we must pay for them. However, in this case, the album was distributed for free. Moreover, there are people who were troubled by it. I think both the artist and Apple should take responsibility for them.  I think automatic freebie is a good idea. Some people like U2's songs taking advantage of delivery. However, this system got a lot of criticism because their album took up valuable iPhone storage space. Some iTunes users certainly were irritated by this. The fact that Bono meant no harm is an important point. If Apple had not made such a system, U2 would not have lost their popularity. I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized.  When I read this article, to tell the truth, I couldn't understand what's happen. Now I think Bono gave away U2's latest album for free on iTunes account without malice, because he wanted iTunes users to listen their new songs, but users were sure to wonder why there was the album on their iTunes account although they didn't download it. Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not.  When I read this article, I thought that an act of Bono was good at the first. This is because we can obtain the latest album of the artist for free. However, I feel that this thought was wrong now. I usually use the android cellphone. So, because I do not use iTunes and structure of iTunes. In this case, U2's album took up valuable iPhone storage space. In the world, there are a lot of people who do not know U2. It is very annoying that the album of the artist which we are not interested in uses the storage space. I think that Apple and an artist should not cause such an event from now on.  I think that U2 doesn't need to apologize. This method is a clear advertising strategy. I don't use the iTunes, so I don't know iTunes's system well enough. But, this case cause slight damage to iTunes user's maybe. If you dislike this music, you only have to delete from iTunes. Consequently, it may be said that U2 achieved a strategic victory. U2 made news with their performance, and then U2 is known by me.  In my case, I don't know U2. So I think this is chance to know the group for free. But thinking from consumers who don't have a interest, it is worth grumbling. If they can choice whether doing download or not, they didn't claim. It is problem the album was download automatically. And people want to erase the album, they have to erase by themselves. Bono apologized to people, but they grumble about the automatically download system and the way of erase the songs. So I think to need to apologize is not so much Bono but Apple.  I think this incident is not all that serious. As they hand out free samples on the street, giving out freebie songs deserve to go down. Recently, people only listen to the music which others are listening to, is famous and popular. In other words, they don't find new music on their own which they really approve. So, freebies of music give us the chances that we can encounter new songs. I think it is a breakthrough idea. But, what couldn't delete the songs was bad if person was not to his liking. After all an unsuitable sample is just like yesterday's garbage.  U2's album downloaded automatically is good strategy for Apple to get to know more people about Apple. Therefore, I think it is not necessary for Apple to apologize. However, I was surprised at this incident when I knew it. I had misgivings about a risk of an outflow of personal information. Therefore, the true that U2's album took up valuable iPhone storage space worried me furthermore. I think it is important to provide an opportunity of the discussion between Apple and us. More detail explanation is necessary for us to understand it.  I think that you must not have an influence on the domain of another person even if it is free. The world becomes convenient by the development of the information technology steadily, but there should be the line which we cannot exceed. It may be good for a method of the advertising, but must not force it on people. Say in Japanese; ARIGATAMEIWAKU. However, we take time to know the real intention of this event.  I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. First, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well. Because their latest album was given away on more than half billion iTunes accounts including mine. Probably lots of people who didn't known them listened to their songs. Next I mention a bad side of it. I think there were two problems in it. First problem is that their latest album was automatically downloaded. As a result of it, some iTunes users griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. Second problem is that Apple made it impossible for people to remove the album from their iTunes accounts. Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action.  I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. First, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well.

Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action.  To give iPhone's users U2's album for free may makes them worry that they bought this album by mistake. To tell the truth, I experienced that. I am a iPhone's user. I did not think it was a problem. However, Apple should let them decide to get this album. The titles of music in your iPhone show your personality. Adding this album to your list without permission is too rude. I think Apple should take the blame for this untoward event.  I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. At first, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well. Because their latest album was given away on more than half billion iTunes accounts including mine. Probably lots of people who didn't know them listened to their songs.

Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action.  When I read this article, I remembered that U2's new album automatically had been downloaded onto my iTunes. It was not I read this until I knew the reason and the details. I can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. However, whether we will listen the song is depend on our right of choice. If we had could choose whether we download or not, everybody's grumbles wouldn't have spread.  When I heard this news, I was very shocking. This is because I have not heard such this problem. If you admit such a thing only in a specific group, other groups hope the same thing and may cause confusion. In addition, they find the profit only for themselves and it is big failure to have brought big uneasiness to too people of the world. It will go without saying that an irreparable thing happens if not conscious of only this so that each people do not cause a problem in now when a network develops. I think that it is the serious news that people of the world realized it.  Action of Bono is bad. There are two reasons . First, action of Bono is selfish . Everyone does not necessarily like this music. Actually, the criticism from many persons came. Second, it is impolite in other bands. Music is things to trade. Therefore, distributing for nothing is self-centered. In conclusion, a deed of Bono has an image of minus.  When I read this news I was surprised. I often use iTunes, and I buy music. Music people like around the world different from not only country to county , but person to person. The sudden the automatic download of U2s may album upset people terribly except for U2's fans. After reading this article, a friend of mine also one of this confusion, she was very surprised at the emergence of the album, If I do so, I will get scary and may not have good feeling. About his affair, apple should not do so automatically, I think. Apple did something unnecessary. Although for U2, they think it is good chance to listen their music around the world, its reputations were not always good thing about this Apple's method. As a result, it may not be expected for them.  When I read this article, I was very surprised because I didn't know this news. I didn't update my iPhone, so this album didn't downloaded to my iPhone automatically. But I think this idea is not so bad. it's because it charge no cost and we can listen to new album. Although it took up valuable iPhone storage space, but it is good to listen to a lot of people all over the world. I think If I am singer, I would do that maybe. but this is not good thing to iPhone users. Apple and Bono should apologized to users.  Before I read this article, I didn't know the news about U2 album. Therefore, I really surprised to know that this kind of thing happened. At first, it seemed that iTunes users felt happy because they actually got the U2's latest album for free!! However, according to this article, many users would have trouble that their valuable iPhone storage was taken up. I don't use iTunes so I don't have enough knowledge about the usage exactly. However if I were in their place, I would be angry like them because such thing, that U2 album was downloaded automatically, was not following my own will. Considering what I wrote, the Bono's behavior was totally bad thing, but I think I can understand the feeling of artists and some burdens, such as pressure. Anyway, this kind of thing should not happen so we should try to make rules to escape such situation and not to permit this kind of actions.  It's terrible. U2's members would be shocked very much. I'm sorry for him. However if I can download a song for free, I will be happy. It's difficult problem.  I think we can't blame the members of U2 for giving away U2's latest album for free on iTunes accounts. Because they did that in order to not only for themselves but also for the iTunes accounts. I think they should had given away their latest album for accounts who wanted to listen their songs.  I understand the feelings Bono wanted a lot of people to hear his music, however, it's illegal to make iTunes accounts downloaded his music automatically. This is because we have human rights to listen to music we want to. But I think it's not bad to make his music free. Moreover I was surprised that he could make his music download our iTunes willfully. I felt scare as I don't know what I am going to be done online.  This problem was caused by U2's thoughtless action. It may be a good attitude for its members to try to make their songs heard all over the world. However, they neglected to take iPhone users' privacy into consideration. They overlooked the fact that the Internet had become another reality, where personal spaces do exist and respected to some extent. For example, If the band were on streets or at some other public places in London as a promotion and distributed its new album to passengers as a freebie, they might not be angry so much and there might be no serious problem. But if it intruded on people's home at random and thrust the album to them, they would feel ""violated"" by the sudden visits and might complain about that. U2 just did the latter in the cyber world and at a much larger scale. So, in conclusion, privacy should be protected even in the Internet world.  When I finished reading this article, I was surprised at this incident. I don't use iTunes, but if I used iTunes, I would be disgusted. I think that iTunes should take responsibility for this trouble rather than Bono. Because If iTunes's security had been stronger, this trouble would have happened.  I was very surprised at this news. I don't angry with the action. However, some people whose devices' capacity of memory are low may complain. If the album had been automatically downloaded, users should have been able to remove it. Artists should be proud of their songs.  I was very interested this article. At first , almost of us may feel sorry for U2. Many people could get the group's new album for free. Dud to it, their sales will decrease seemingly. However, we can see this problem from different point. Although their album was released free in iTunes, we can see some good point for U2 in this article. This is known globally due to the itself bigness and we can think it is good advertisement for U2. Their new album is known by many people and it will be good business.  I am surprised that U2's new album is downloaded arbitrarily. I don't have iPod, iPhone and so on. So when I knew the news , I am surprised.  This is the news of rock musicians who gave their latest album for free. In the wake of it, that incident arouse a some kind of problem. In short , suffice it to say that rock band group U2, especially Bono misunderstood what the consumers pleased with. Also It is true that a handful of i phone users might presume that 'What an elaborated and nice present this is!' . But other i phone users specially who are not interested in U2 must have thought it was infringement of their valuable asset, that is , limited capacity. Their merits are not incongruous with each other. May be Bono has chimera that their songs might please everybody. So, as a trade-off strategy Bono should have introduced selection system. in other words, those who want to listen to their music only can download them for free.  I was surprised when I saw this article on the Internet. There are many people who blame Bono. However, I think that they must not blame Bono. Bono gave away U2's latest album for free, because he thought that many people will be happy about giving away the album for free. He want many people to be happy. So, we must not blame Bono.  When I read the article, I thought giving away U2's latest album for free was not bad thing. Certainly, some people feel uncomfortable when the new album was automatically downloaded onto iTunes because of their tastes, and other may misunderstand they downloaded unknown artist's music by mistake. However, almost users wouldn't care about new music's and I think the new album does no harm, because if someone don't like them, they should delete new album. Bono had no malice, so they don't have to be blamed so much.  This news interested me so much. I didn't know this article. At first, I thought this attempt would make all people, whether they are fans or not. Because of freebie, they need not pay any money. They can listen to their songs at free. However, I was to consider this attempt is no favor at all. Some fans might be happy, but those who are not interested in this artist must be unhappy. Because they don't need these songs and may not hear forever. More consideration might have needed for Bono.  I think U2 didn't do bad thing because it is freebie and they can remove the album from their iTunes account. It isn't good to take up valuable strange space certainly, but people who like U2's music will be glad. Not only U2 but also Apple should apologize to iTunes user for their own careless system.  I think the same way as you. I don't use iTunes so I know little about that, but the strange is so important for us. In addition, if you use them to your daily works, it's more important to you. I want that the same thing never happen.  When I signed iTunes without knowing the download, I wasn't aware of the downloading. So I was very surprised the news as you. I want to have Apple never do such action.  I think that this news is a problem about intellectual property rights. Apple must not made such a system. Because, artists don't enough to be protect. If iTunes's security is stronger, this trouble didn't happen. I think Apple should apologize to iTunes user and U2.  I think what U2 did was not so bad because it was a chance that would make people who have never known about U2 realize a new fantastic artist. When you find that U2's new album is automatically downloaded for free, you will be confused at first. First of all, you should try to listen to the album. If you have really taken to them, this action of U2 is good, on the other hand, if you have no interest in them, you can delete them. This is a strategy. I think this is good for you to know a new fantastic artist for free.  I watched the CM of U2's new album for free on iTunes on TV, so I was not so surprised at this news, but in my first time watching the CM, I was so surprised because U2 is world famous rock group. I think that that is not so bad thing because if I did not know U2 at that time, I tried to listen to the album for free.  I also think this automatic freebie is not so bad. Bono got a chance of making widely known, and of course he made good use of it. This is a natural thing, so we should not blame him.  Your opinion is good, though I think i in part disagree with it. As you say, It may be true that the freebie action which they did functioned as expanding our music experience. Yet I insist that it was much different from campaigns that are done on the street. They violated ""personal areas"" that surely exist in the Internet. It is like in real life they invade your home and thrust the album independently of your will. In this point, I think what they did was quite serious.  After I read this article, I checked my iPhone's music application. There are several U2's songs. I didn't realize it before I read this, so I was very surprised. The problem of this article is security quality of Apple. I think the trouble in this article is important but isn't so much dangerous, because it is only downloaded automatically by Apple. However, we can assert that Apple's security system is careless. If Apple flow out personal information, it would be more important and dangerous problem than this article's one. So Apple should improve its security system.  I didn't know the CM. If I can listen the music that I have never known for free, I am very glad. I also think that is not so bad thing.  I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized, too. However, I don't think automatic freebie is a good idea. In fact, this system may take up valuable iPhone storage space. Because I use Android Phone, I do not know the iPhone in detail. But, according to what I heard, this seems to be an annoying thing. That's why I am against your opinion.  Your opinion is so good! The thought did not hit to me. U2 surely succeeded as an advertisement strategy. Judging from such a viewpoint, there is not the reason to apologize for.  I was surprised when I read your comment because you wrote that you had signed in iTunes and actually you had gotten the U2's album!!! I don't use the iTunes so don't know well about it, but I understood how you were surprised when that happened. Anyway, I agree with you in that it's not good to be downloaded automatically.  I sympathize with your comment. I think that not only Bono but also Apple apologize to people who are iTunes users. Apple should prepare the way people can select whether the album download or not . So following the way, people who get angry about taking valuable space of download and the way the album erase themselves don't angry like that.  I agree with your two opinions. This is because it was able to understand a thought not only it troubled not only many general people, but also other singers and bands. When people of the world become egocentric, you may imagine easily that we will confuse. In addition to their action having confused people, you must not forget to have had possibilities to be a chance to do the thought that other people are egocentric either. That's why, their action was so bad as you say.  I agree with your opinion. Apple also should apologize for consumers and give choice whether they download latest U2's album or not.  These days I can not keep up with the improvement in technology. However I think that people giving receiver something that receiver does not want is so rude. Soliciting papers, cult, coercive selling etc. . . should we notice ' No Hawkers or Salesmen' online? The Internets are full of ads! I can not stand it.  I agree with this opinion. When I heard this news firstly, I was surprised. However as this opinion said, I could not think this problem is familiar to me because I also don't have iPod, iPhone and iPad.  I wonder why there are new songs on my iTunes list though I did not download any music on iTunes. After read this article I could solve this problem. The songs automatically downloaded is lucky for someone, but it might be trouble for many people. In my situation, there is enough storage in my computer, so this songs is not big influence for me. But if there is little storage in computer it is big problem for the computer user. I think this artist did this action for good faith. But we must consider other people before do any actions.  I understand your stance a lot. The valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in are so bad. Apple and U2 should apologize.  I think your criticism is inaccurate and moreover misses the point. This delivery service is caused by U2. So, U2's property rights are not violated. This is U2's advertising strategy. I think it is interesting departure in advertising strategy. Of course, U2 doesn't need to apologize.  Given the optimistic, so it might be good. However, iTunes users are downloading pay money and download music. If music you do not know is entered people's iPhone, it will be surprising That's too bad.  When I read your accurate opinion, I can understand this article deeply. I also think it is a bad side of it to download automatically. I can understand the people who griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. However, it is a great strategy of Apple to provide people using iTunes with the record for free.  I approve with your opinion. We must consider other people's situation and feelings. It is very important thing. Also I think all of us should take to heart this complication. Bono's complication is large scale and have influenced lots of people in the world. But in daily life, there are many like instances. So we should not think this complication is not related to our daily life.  I agree with your opinion. I also can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. Although he should apologize to users, he shouldn't be blame so.  I thought that their this scheme is very selfish and troublesome. In addition to this, their explanation, ""deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard"", is very childish and deserves a disgust. There are so many singers or artists who are afraid that their works won't be paid attention to and bought at all. But they are trying to make a good thing with a sense of fear. As long as they are professional, they have to make effort to create terrific and worthy things.  I do not agree with you so much. We have human rights what kind of music we listen, so I think some people would be unpleasant and it is not good that Bono give away the album even if it is free of charge.  It is a difficult problem in these days that the Internet has spread. Such problems can be occurred at any time. In this case, this problem just happened to the famous and popular Irish rock band and caused heavy damage, so it created a great sensation, I think.  I agree with you in terms of the trouble of storage, so I think they should have sent their music not automatically but able to choose.  I have been convinced to your opinion. The right to choose will be required even if download is no charge. The album of U2 downloaded also to my ipod. I was dissatisfied, seeing it. If I did not download, supposing it was able to choose. And probably, dissatisfaction was not felt, either.  I agreed with your opinion too. It is true that iphone users including me were at a loss what action they should do. They might lose their temper, but in terms of U2, they only want to know everyone their music. Thus, we iphone users should understand their feelings.  When I read the article, I could understand what had occurred to my iTunes finally. I had been so surprised to see the album on my iTunes which I hadn't had any memories to buy, and then thought ""It must be my mistake. . . oh, I waste my money. "" So I was relieved when reading the article, but the same time I also felt the system bothered me because the album fill some capacity of my pc and iPhone.  I think this kinds of free downloading is part of advertisements. Because these musics are free and if you do not like it, then you can throw it. So you do not have to keep it. Also iTunes is the service of Apple. Apple is independent company. So they can do whatever they want for their customers. Of course, sometimes this kind of troubles would happen. But it should be accepted.  I disagree your opinion, because ""to delete"" is a very trouble work for me. Please imagine the situation, not only U2 but many artists adopt the system. In your iTunes and iPhone, there will appear many strange albums. The capacity will fill instantly, and you have to delete them. Isn't it so trouble? I was not able to understand this problem, either. From the campaign of Apple, profits of 100 million dollars are produced and, seemingly, 26 million download was attained. But, like of you, there are some users who are not pleased that their memory is used freely. I think that it was put on the advertising strategy.  After reading this news, I became aware of U2 and listened to songs of their new album I got in my iPhone. Considering it, Bono's strategy is very effective. And by expressing apology, he tried to restore public confidence. I think he is clever.  I have same opinion. I thought Bono should not have made his music downloaded in iTunes of many people and I was surprised that Bono could do such thing.  I think so too. Nowadays, streaming music is in currency. It will be normal to keep the music you like and throw away the one you do not like.  I agree with you. They are professional singer. So they should make effort to make good staff by their own.  I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes because i also have given the music automatically. But, I don't think this is such a big problem in the world. so I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Of course, Bono has some responsibility. But, if the control system of iTunes worked well, the problem didn't cause. iTunes should make the rule more strict.  I agree with your opinion. If the same things happen to me, I will be confused and won't feel good.  I myself like U2's music since I was little because my father also likes U2. I personally think that everyone should listen to the stuff before saying it's a rude act or something like that. However, from others point of view, it is certainly a rude act that they were sent a music they did not want. I want those people to know how marvelous U2's music is.  I think the deed which U2 did is not bad thing. New album of U2 is free and is not annoyance for most people. But apples give people who use iTunes a choice which download or not. Personally I like U2 , so i'm happy.  I agree with you. At first, I also wondered why there was the album on my iTunes account. In my case, I enjoyed listening their album, but I think some were angry with it. So I also think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not.  I agree with your opinion. If people don't like these songs, they can delete these songs. So, I think it's not their faults. Moreover, the whole capacity in the iTunes is huge enough to memorize a lot of songs. People should not care of these songs.  I agree with your opinion. I don't have iTunes account, but if I had iTunes account, I would be disgusted and angry to apple.  I totally agree with you. U2 is one of the best bands in the world. There musics are wonderful.  I think so, too. I think Apple shouldn't ignore this situation.  I agree with you. U2 should have given away their latest album to those who were eager to listen to their songs.  I was surprised and glad when I read this article. That is because I can get U2's album for free. As to problem, I think this is not so bad like such. Moreover U2 is very popular artist all over the world. I can't understand why this problem was so serious all over the world. But certainly, If I don't like U2 much or hate U2, My opinion might have changed. Much of criticism may be from such people who don't like U2 much.  I agree with you. I think he want many people to be happy too. I don't understand why this thing or he is criticized by a lot of people all over the world.  Hearing this news, first, I could not what U2 wanted to do. Without doing such a fool thing, U2 is popular and a good band and I am one of U2's fan. Because of this free download , u2 and apple got a lot of money , I heard. It is very rude. I hope no artist does such a thing , including U2. By the way I was also surprised that young people do not know U2.  Hearing this news, first, I could not what U2 wanted to do. Without doing such a fool thing, U2 is popular and a good band and I am one of U2's fan. Because of this free download , u2 and apple got a lot of money , I heard. It is very rude. I hope no artist does such a thing , including U2. By the way I was also surprised that young people do not know U2.  If I can get my favorite artist's album, I would be glad. However, U2 and Apple should not do that because it was rude thing. Their act made people who do not like U2 angry.  I agree with you. If same things happen to me, I will not feel good too.  I approve this idea. Because the recipient can touch new music for free of charge, people get new music for free of charge. So I estimate the idea very highly. It is true getting the music for the person who doesn't need is very troublesome. But it's a very lucky thing for a person who needs the music conversely. I have mistaken u2 for a virus. I want a preliminary report from the next!!! I agree with you. I think it is wrong that only U2 is criticized because Apple made the system of free access. Also, It was good thing because people who do not know U2 can listen to their music easily.  I completely agree with you. I'm sad when I think how shocked U2's members were. I extend their sympathy to them.  I don't agree with you. Of course, U2 gave away his latest songs, but he got a lot of profit with Apple. U2 made some people happy, but more people were confused by what he did.  I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. It's terrible. However if I can download music freely, I would feel happy.  I agree with you. I think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not.  I think that this is an irrelevant opinion. First, advertising is selfish in a basic way. U2's method is a clear advertising strategy. So, we unilaterally receive information. It seem to selfish is not surprising. Second, U2 is not impolite. Their method is legitimate form of advertising. Other bands should use the same technique as U2.  I don't know U2, too. so I have same opinion. I think that this event is commercial, so Apple which admitted it is bad. But I have a good chance to know about U2.  I don't think he(or she) need to say that much about Bono! I can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. I don't think he is selfish.  I think Bono's idea is good. It is because it charge free. I think If you don't have storage space in iPhone and PC, you just can delete this music. I agree with Bono.  I think some people would be unpleasant and it is not good that Bono give away the album even if it is free of charge.  I didn't know the news before I read this in this class. However, I am the iTunes user, so I am interested in the detail. Also, It was possible that I was drawn this problem actually. Now, the iTunes users are increasing in the world. In this case, the album was distributed for free. I think that iTunes should make the rule secure.  I agree to her opinion,  there are two reasons. First, I also think that it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized. Second, the reasons are same as mine.  Why didn't he just try to listen to the music? U2 is one of the most famous singer in the world.  I do not think "" this problem was caused by U2's thoughtless action. "" This campaign was carried out on iTunes of Apple. So, I think U2 wanted to widen their music, but Apple was a little brute force.  I also strongly think Apple should give choice whether they download latest U2's album or not.  I think so, too. I don't use iTunes. But if it happen to me, I get into panic such as ""I bought an album without being noticed. "".  I was kind of aware that the song which I never had bought was on my iTunes. I don't think that is the bad idea to put their music on everyone's iTunes account automatically, but they should have given us the options. In that way everybody could have been so happy.  This news is very hot one for me. One day, when I listened to my music in my usual way, the unknown song started suddenly. I thought my iPhone was corrupted at that time. Certainly, like many people, I griped at consuming iPhone's storage without my permission and U2's arrogant action. But the just thing made my feeling bad is what Apple can make our iPhones downloaded things automatically. I want Apple not to do such a thing from now on.  I agree with you in terms of the trouble of not only storage but also sending data files. "
JOC JOC-14B-08N -0.28 "Since I had the image that Canada was safe, this incident surprised me. I am regret that the criminal who is key person of this incident has died. The same incident may occur in Japan. I think that Japan does not have a sense of crisis of terrorism. By getting to know this incident, the Japan house should also strengthen the watch to terrorism.  Attacks such as religious terrorist shootings gives a terrible impact on our society and people's lives . I think think that 's a very big blow that the important figures of the terrorists had killed without catching. I think that many countries need to raise the level of the terrorist measures and Japan also do not think it is someone else's business.  I think that this news surprised a Japanese. This is because Canada has not a dangerous image such as the Middle East. I also thought that Canada was a safe country. However, this image completely changed by this incident. At the same time, Japan came to have to think about terrorism seriously, too. The standby alert for other countries such as North Korea may be surely set. But, I think that Japan must raise the level of the terrorist about from the specific thought group except the country.  I was surprised at this news so much. I have been to Canada once. When I visited there, I thought how quiet place here is and how peace Canada is. Thus this news about gunman astonished me so much. In addition to that, I think we could understand the seriousness of ISIS. ISIS problems will expand more and more. Other countries like USA, UK, Japan and so on should take some measures.  In this article, there are two interesting point. At first, how many people believe that Canada is safe place. I can deny this strongly. It is because Canada allows people to have their own guns although the system is so strict. Moreover Canada is next to the US In such a society, we always have to watch out the danger. Second, Canada isn't like his next country. If this kind of thing happened in his next country, he should return to his enemy soon and essentially. However, he didn't do such thing. I think his next country have to learn his attitude.  I agree with your opinion. I also thought Canada is the safety and peaceful country. It is necessary for Canada to identify why this terrorism happened and to keep people from taking such cruel action again. Then, Japan has the possibility to occur horrific terrorism. Now Japan has strict rules about gun, so gun fight hardly takes place in Japan. However, terrorist might attack people by harmful chemical weapon as Aum Shinrikyo. We have to settle many problem existing Japan to prevent terrorism.  I was very surprised to read this article, because I did not have an image which Canada is involved in terrorism. Even a country which is safe, we cannot know when the country will be involved in International issues. Not to cause matter like this, many country include Japan have to tackle this problem.  Though I think Canada is peaceful country, you must be surprised at this article from your experience. Your opinion is persuasive enough. I wish this diplomatic issue can be solve as possible.  When I read this article, I was really surprised because I thought Canada was as safe as Japan. However the terrible terrorism has occurred in Canada, so I think it is possible to happen such as a terrorism in Japan. So far, the terrorism seldom occur because there is a strict gun control in Japan, so that it is difficult for Japanese to image about it. If the incident happens, they will not correspond with it. In order to correspond with it, we must know this news and whenever the terrorism happens. Government should solve this problem in cooperation with other countries.  When I heard about this news, I was very surprised at it because I have imagined that Canada was a peaceful country. Also, this news indicate that Islamic State is a menace to world peace. All the country should cooperate with and control IS's menace.  I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised to read this article. Attacks such as religious terrorist were threat to us because these attacks point to people who are only general citizen. We have to take measures as soon as in Japan.  I totally agree with you. I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised too.  I agree with you. In truth, Japan is safe compared with other country. But we should be alert every time as you say, because there isn't complete safe zone all over the world.  I was so surprised and scared because I had an image that Canada is peaceful place and there were no terrorists. "" There will have no heaven. "" I got strong impression from this speech. We, all the countries should fight with Islamic's menace. "
JOC JOC-14B-10N -0.13 "I think that his action is too rash. Participating in the war freely in Syria is bringing about confusion in Japan. Although Japan has the Self-Defense Forces, it never does such action. Also he participated as a combatant of the radical Islamic group which has had big influence all over the world so I think that it is unavoidable that he is recognized as a person antisocial by the Japanese government.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience.  I think the happiness cannot be decided by anyone but the person himself. , so if a man seem to be happy because of his status or property, maybe he does not feel he is happy. In Japan, I think there are many people who feel unhappy despite of their objective happiness. The man in this news is one of such people, and he want the meaning of his presence. I want him to know that there are many people who have nothing and dread being implicated in war.  I cannot understand his action and thought. Participating in the war voluntarily means that to go to seek the death in danger. I think the era that he has been bullied creates him now. I was sad when I read this article. It is impossible for me that there is Japanese who want to participate in the war. The drift of Japanese is toward against war. It is because that Japan has experienced many hardships by many of the victims of the war. However, I think that his remark, ""Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world"", is not wrong. We talk about world affairs without knowing the real world. It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. I hope that there is no war from this world.  I cannot understand that he thinks. He proceeds to the battle front to fight naturally. It brings Japan confusion and will have some influences on the world. If there is the basic cause for bullying, it may be a serious problem. I don't know the small international situation, but the war may be taking place from the imminent place.  I agree to your opinion. There will be a lot of people feeling uneasy to hear this news. I will have an influence on the world by his careless action as well as Japan. Such an action is very dangerous in the world where does not know what happens. It hide possibility to cause big damage to not only oneself but also another person. I think that a careful action is demanded anytime when I have anything to do with the world.  I think Japanese should think the conflicts between Islam and Christianity. Japanese traditional religions do not have features of Monotheism. And Islam is not familiar in Japan. So what we must do now is to study the Koran and fully understand it. After that, Japanese would understand Islamic State is not based on the way of Islamic thinking. So it is suspicious the existence of IS itself. I want to ask him that he really understand Islam and what he does. I think he does not. when we communicate with foreign people. It is necessary to understand the ethos of them. And in their backgrounds, there are always religions.  I can not understand his feeling. The life is more important than any other thing for me. I think that Syria is a very dangerous place, so his action is unbelievable for me even if he has any reason.  When finished reading the article, I took his words, ""Japan is a Galapagos society. Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world. "" very seriously. I cannot image his fierce experiences and the situation completely, but I can know these facts by reading books, hearing people and watching TV etc. We, live in a peace and Galapagos society don't seem to pay attentions to such situation of the world. However, we should do that to know the real world, and think what we can do for that.  I was surprised at there was the person who committed a crime of Preparations or Plots for Private War. Surely it is important to see what happens in the world by our own eyes, but he crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed. He should have choked back personal desire, and I think it is not for him to participate the war, but to embark on ridding the war.  When I read article, I was so surprised, and I cannot understand his action. Almost of people around the world do not want to take part in a war. Nevertheless, he tried to take part in a war. I really cannot understand his action and feeling. I think that he must respect his life in any circumstances.  I agree with your opinion. I think that there are a little people who can understand his action and feeling. He must respect his life in any circumstances.  I think his behavior is too reckless and too childish. In a war, not only soldiers but also civilians are in danger, so it's best if we can avoid such a dangerous situation. Nothing is more precious than human's life. However, he went to Syria, the belligerent nation and he would be helping to kill people. I can't understand what he thinks. Whatever he assert, I never agree with his action.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. I can't understand his actions and behavior. I hope that there is no war from this world.  I respect of Mr. Uzawa because he is really active and brimful of intellectual curiosity. Converting to Islam is little going too far , but I reconfirm that having much of life makes a person of great depth.  I was so surprised that Japanese man fights at the Islam war and I respect him. However, I hate the war so I hope the war will be vanish.  I read Asahi Shimbun, and learned about this news. When this article in a general news page, I was a lot surprised. It's because it wasn't believed that one ordinary Japanese youth goes to a trouble area personally. The behavior which doesn't think back to such danger threatens the life of the youths. I don't know whether the relief disposal is in Japan. But it may be the one which is when Japan thinks why the youths go to a trouble area.  He just should be the member of the SDF If he likes fighting. I cannot understand his idea. His action is illegal in our country. Why should he go to Syria? I think the root of this issue is the social structure of Japan. Japanese young people have few money. Young people cannot make dreams and disappoint with the society. I think this is not a personal problem but social problem in Japan.  I agree your ideas but please let me to mention my thought. I, you and also other people would not like to join the war. However he does. Though we cannot understand his ideologies, we should not criticize them.  This news was very shocking for me. We first surprised, it is that he could easily be in contact with the Islamic countries. This Tsu I indicates a problem that is happening in Islam that we also are familiar. Such a conflict in the Middle East was surprised to second longer it is that it has become not what religious. This means that I said to be a negative legacy was born by globalization. In any case, it must act accordingly to such incidents from occurring I agree with you. Young people today, including he and I, do not what a war is like, so it some of them do not understand how dangerous and misery a war is. This incident shows us that there is possibility that Japan will be involved in war. we should make effort to protect it! First, I am very interested in this article, so I have various feelings. His comment is the very comment which get my feeling. Moreover, as he said, ""It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. "", this comment is very important for me.  Surprise and ""Respect"" that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination.  'Surprise' and 'Respect' that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination. "
JOC JOC-14B-11N -0.36 "When I heard about this news for the first time, I was disgusted at it. I have often heard news about politics and money problem recently. I think it is not good that government stops by politicians' problems which shouldn't be took up in the Diet primarily. I was disgusted to see that members of the Diet quarrel about that a round bill is a fan or not. Mr Abe declare the slogan, ""the society women can play an active part in. "" Therefore he adopted no less than five female Cabinet ministers. However two ministers were forced into positions in which they must resign. It is sure that Mr Abe and the cabinet are in a difficult time.  I was very surprised that such misconduct has occurred that some days aren't passed when the Minister of Economy changed. Ms. Obuchi resigned by being suspended that she has a funding scandal. When government elect the next Minister, I wonder why Abe Prime Minister didn't research the people who properly became a candidate. In the process of researching, government must find that the local secretary of Miyazawa had put out the unnecessary political activity costs. I thought it was really not have been made firmly .  The responsibility of the politician in this incident is large. I was disappointed about the politician having used money for self-interest. A politician tends to leave a report to a secretary. However, even if it does not know injustice, the politician has to take the responsibility. That is, the politician should worry about a subordinate's deed. Their resignation became a cause by which the approval rating for the prime minister fell. The politician should become prudent to use people's tax.  I was surprised at this news because the top politicians have less responsibility and abuse their expense. They were blinded by self-interest. Their work is not for themselves but for people. I think the politicians must remember the spirit that they started with and pride themselves for their work.  Recently, scandal by politician occur frequently. I was offended when I watched they apologized for their mistake formality. And I was surprised at Mr Miyazawa's state that he himself did not go there at all. It shows he doesn't have no responsibility for members of his political group. I want not to watch such politician anymore. It's incredible to use tax from citizen. Management of money should be strict and voter need choose candidates more carefully.  Whenever I hear a funding scandal of politicians, I lose a trust of politicians. I wish them to have more responsibility of their behaviors. The most thing I was surprised is a scandal that women were involved. One of prime minister Abe's goal is social advancement of women. However, the scandal like Ms. Obuchi's will become a reason to prevent from social advancement of women. Many politicians' relatives also are politicians. I think it is not good for modern politics. It is because that their relatives tell their opinions. It is of course not to change to better direction. I hope that such incident never happen again.  I was so disappointed!!! This is my first impression when I heard about this news. Maybe many Japanese people have had enough of this kind of news, Japanese politicians' financial problems before. In this case, I was very surprised because this scandal about Yoichi Miyazawa came to light as soon as he was appointed the new economy, trade and industry minister. I really want them to have more responsibility towards their actions because they work as a leader of Japan. As for changing Japanese Prime Minister quickly, it's not good for Japan's impression from other countries. Moreover, I was very shocked about the news that Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima resigned because of financial problems. As this article says, this kind of thing prevents Mr Abe's goal of having more female representation in the upper echelons of government, and I really hope his goal will come true as a woman. Therefore, I think we should reconsider how the politicians behave and the system that have many family members. I think it should be changed to make them act correctly by their heart as a member of Japanese citizens, not by their family members' voice.  I was shocked at two points of the article. First, representations of general people were occurred many bad problems. Although I think they are smart, I wonder why they behave dishonestly . Not to tell a lie and to follow rules are so simple and easy rule to understand and obey. Second , this cases were caused by two women of ministers. Mr Abe proceeds the plan having more female representations in the upper echelons of government. But, the problems such as this article made bad. Impression about the plan or females. I think the plan refer to a fundamental problem about sexism. And the plan is unnatural way. So I hope the world become gender neutral without unnatural support from a country.  When I read this article, I was surprised very much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In the situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the JT007 bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms. Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more.  In these days, I hear much news that politicians' use taxes in wrong ways. This cse is also one of those news. Mr. Miyazawa said he did not go to the club but I think the most important point is not in whether he went there, but in the money used was paid by citizens. However, it is true that there are many cases like this. I think there are much more that we unaware of. I want him to regret that he should be more careful to his staffs' behavior, but, on the other hand, I cannot help but sympathize with him.  I think so, too. He should apologize not for his behavior but for his carelessness. We will have right to vote soon so we should choose candidate carefully.  When I heard this news, I was disappointed because this news was the same thing until now. After Mr. Abe became the prime minister, I thought to be reliable because there is no scandal, we were so surprised and it was a shock. However, I think that I want them to do their best that it is hopeless one to have got up and no longer loses the trust of the nation. I think that I want them to change conventional bad politics little by little from now on.  I don't think that this news is so disappointing. It's nothing new. In our long, long political history, we have learned that politicians in Japan sometimes spend much money from their funds as ""political activities"" which seem unreasonable or ridiculous in common sense (for example, grand banquets in typical exclusive Japanese restaurants or expensive hot spring resorts, in order to hope for something like funding or cooperating in return) and realized that these activities are sometimes necessary. And this expense on a sex club is, though it might be a bit too dirty, surely a one of such activities. So, what is the matter? Since our nation's great and high-minded politicians have already eaten up our precious taxes more or less, is there any use in criticizing the expense alone? Rather, let's praise it for ""having spent only 18, 230 yen"" and ""not having wasted our taxes so much as in other political activities"" ! We citizens should not narrow our visions. In this case, we and mass media should have not focus on the word, ""expense on a sex club"" too much. The Diet has been in danger of losing its solid foundation. If we complain about trifles, it will surely delay its economical actions or diplomatic policies which are far more important than trivial, non-illegal scandals.  I agree with your comment. This deplorable scandal had a big influence all over Japan. It is a big blow that two female ministers resigned at once for Abe's cabinet.  It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal. Such an uproar is repeated and the confidence of Japanese government is undermined. The scandal of minister has no relation to prime minister directly, but Japanese people have a bad impression. I hope Japanese government will have strong support from the public.  I think that the Obuchi's scandal is the most serious problem because she could not understand how much money she used and the political fund is not hers. She must know her spending a lot of money and we must not choose a person who cannot control his or her money. Ms Matsushima should not quit her job because of trifling thing as Uchiwa.  When I read this article, I though there are a lot of scandals by politician recently and I was very disappointed for Japanese political office. It is absolutely prohibit things to use tax for private use. The article says, Mr Miyazawa didn't go to club and his member went to. But I am skeptical about it. I strongly believe if people investigate more, a lot of scandals will revealed. I wish no scandals anymore.  In Japanese politics, these problems what related to politicians and money often happened. Politicians are representations of citizens. So they should behave as such. However, they don't. I can't understand why politicians can not obey the law. It is sure that we citizens are also responsibility for election, but I think politicians are lacking in sense of responsibility. So, citizens should elect statesman carefully and people who want to be involved in politics should have more responsibility.  This is disappointing news. Trade minister Yoichi Miyazawa claims that he did not go to JT007 bar though this claim is irrational. His point detracts from the real issue. Politicians must spend a political fund for the national interest . It is democratic destruction to collect votes by spending a political fund. Therefore I can't permit not only Miyazawa but the scandal of Ms Obuchi too. She was involved in payoff scandal. I think she destroyed the faith to the democracy.  I sympathize with your opinion. Recently, politician causes a problem too much. This is annoying thing fo us. Especially, there are a great many problems about the tax. I feel that a politician despises the nation. The politician should take responsibility even if a politician is not related to a problem directly.  I agree with you. The money paid by citizen should be used more carefully. We wouldn't be aware of other case. Politicians should feel a sense of guilt.  The scandal of the Japanese politician is one of the news to hear well. However, the nation will have distrust for politics of Japan whenever we hear the news. The cabinet aiming at the social advance of the woman must be upset now, too. This is because a woman politician becomes a target of the scandal. I think that future correspondence is very important. I want you to try to never have such a thing.  Recently, many people more focus on what a politician did in their private than what they will do in future. I think this tendency is not good. In this case , many people blame Miyazawa's secretary going to sexual club to have a talk with someone. In my opinion , we blame this opinion too much. I can't tell going to such a club to have a political chat from going to a bar to have a political chat. We have to realize that there is something more important than that.  I agree with you in that the politician should have take the responsibility. As you wrote, they use the tax Japanese citizens paid, so they have to be more careful and become prudent to use it. I really hope they will never do that, and don't want to hear about such politicians' financial news any more.  I was so disgusted about Mr. Miyazawa because his support group spent office money at a JT007 bar, which is a questionable place. Also I disappointed with Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima's resignation because I was looking for women legislators to take a lively part in the government. If they hadn't been concerned with their problems directly, they should have understood what their support group did and stopped their wrong doing.  I agree with your opinion. Government should research about candidates and their local secretary before electing the next minister.  I think that the different opinion of your viewpoint is great. The action of the politician is not good, but I think their private is not protected. They must take action like politician, but I think that the life as the commoner should be promised. I think that we have to criticize the action of media.  When I heard this news, I was disappointed so much. In these days, there are a lot of scandals related politicians. Ms. Obuchi and Ms. Matsushima resigned a few days ago. The reason why Ms. Obuchi resigned was she used money , which was political funds, for private. In addition to that, she said that she did not understand anything because her secretary took charge of all her money. Politics in Japan is in critical situation, I think. It should be changed as soon as possible.  I agree with this opinion. I also think that Ms. Obuchi could not understand how much money she used and her secretary took charge of her all money. Such a person should not be elected.  I agree with you. Recently Japanese politics are lacking in sense of responsibility. We should watch carefully how their money moved and make statements.  When I know this article, I got angry with Japan minister who support staff spent office money at a sex club. This is because they spent unjustified expenses with taxpayer's money. Recently there are some scandal in Abe's cabinet. So my distrust of Abe's cabinet has been increasing since it happened. Moreover I think it is not enough that politicians take part in the government sincerely.  When I read this article, I was so shocked. I had known resignation of two women ministers, but I had never thought that the successor, Mr. Miyazawa already had occurred scandal. Recently politicians often cause many scandals. Every time I hear such a news, I feel sad. They should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us. I hope that they will not disappoint us any more.  I agree with you. Presence of the second-generation politicians means that preventing political reform. So, we should spot exceptionally capable politicians. I hope to get executed women's full participation in society.  One could argue that a funding scandal of politicians is shameful and Japanese politicians need to be held accountable for chosen delegate. However, it won't get you anywhere to say something. Illegal diversion of the political fund is not the first time. New one will no doubt become apparent. It could be worse. I suspect there are a lot of financing problem which have yet to come to light. Specified Secrets Protection Bill will put this regulation into practice on December 10. I have qualms about restriction of the right to know and decreasing of funding issues out in the open.  I think politician must be honest. Seeing recent political circumstances, if we may be able to find evidences against their policies. When I have read this article, I am disappointed the politician Although he explained that he did not have inappropriate money spending by himself, he was not able to mangy his staffs. He will be responsible for caring. Every one in Japan must regard spending money at SM bar as bad thing. I think I want a politician such this article to have morality.  I thought politicians who are nationally representation should take the right course of action. Recently, politicians' scandal is reported well. People were disappointed the politician every time, and it has lost reliance. Since politician's scandals does not happen any more, we should continue supervising.  I agree with your opinion. Politicians should be responsible for their own finance. In Ms. Obuchi's case, she escape from the explanation for her political money problem. But in reality, the Japanese political financial system cannot be changed. Before Ms, Obuchi 's problem was apparent, there have been lots of political financial problem. Moreover, political money problem is not a Japanese characteristic problem but a common problem all over the world. It is tremendously hard to prevent politicians from spending their public fundings illegally.  I agree with your opinion. Such as this news, politician must be faithful and honest. betraying people's trust is especially that. This problem may be uneasy to solve.  If the SM bar is admitted legally, visiting SM bar is not criticized. There are many kind of people who have uncommon sexual tendencies. Therefore, whether going to SM bar is decided by his own will. we cannot have the right to blame it. However, if the SM bar's spending is used from public funding or contribution, Mr. Miyazawa should apologize to people for spending money badly.  After read this article, I was disappointed at this news because the top politicians do not have responsibility for their positions. It is completely out of the question that they use our tax for private using. They representative of Japanese citizen so I want them to more concentrate on their political works not on private amusement.  It is no exaggeration to say that the latest politician scandal hit the prime minister Abe. Mr. Miyazawa was suspected that his political support group spent 18230 yen at the sex club. He emphasized he had never been there. Whether he went there or not , I think the Japanese people lost trust of him as well as other politicians. Moreover I think Mr. Abe is responsible for such scandals because the politicians were appointed by Mr. Abe. Many of politicians have no awareness of responsibility as representative. They should think what to do for country.  The amount of money of the political fund that the staff of Miyazawa used the an SM bar is not so big, but in these days such as people investigate about the purpose for which money is spent of the political fund strictly statesmen should be discreetly, I think.  I think the members of the cabinet should check the expenses of ministers and modify them if there are any faults. I have two reasons. First, it is done at the cabinet of Koizumi. And one of the members of them said yes it works well when PM chooses ministers. Second, funds such as slush funds of Legislators are necessary evil. Because when they want to do something in the diet, they should make political factions, or unite for a policy that they want to realize. Therefore, they use many funds without concerning they are legal or illegal. But without doing so, Japan's politics is not useful for Japanese. In my conclusion, we should rethink the personnel affairs.  I agree with your opinion. I was so shocked when I read this article. I think also that top politicians have less responsibility. If his abuse were true, he also should resign.  I think so, too. The situation of the cabinet goes to the direction where is reverse to the aim that is called ""activity of the woman"" the Mr. Abe advocated. It is very interesting how he'll deal with this.  Since Mr. Miyazawa is a minister who are appointed due to the corruption of Ms. Obuchi, I thought he is reliable and irrelevant to disgraceful affairs. Therefore, I felt disappointed that the same thing was repeated. I think it will be more and more difficult for prime minister Shinzo Abe to keep supports and trusts by a people . Mr. Miyazawa have to reflect on this problem seriously and make every effort to regain a reliance Using our tax for private use is completely out of the question. They have no responsibilities for what they do. I want them to have realization of representative Japanese citizen.  When I heard the news , I am surprised. I am surprised that officers who should observe the law invaded them. So we should observe officers' act.  I also approve of your opinion. A political fund belongs to national. Obuchi does not have the idea. She has to examine herself. Naturally she resigned. She lost public confidence.  I agree with you because I want the politician to do their duty and not to hurt their work's pride badly. I hope they won't do bad things any more.  I agree with your opinion. I think also that they are blinded by self-interest. I wish they work for citizens not for themselves.  I was surprised when I heard this news. However the point is not whether they paid on what kind of sex pub and so on but also they paid on private things. As a result people such as them limit to the rule due to their idleness! Why don't they care about others who works hard and seriously? Never make hard workers reluctant. They should be ashamed of themselves.  I was really disappointed in the statesmen in Japan to when I read the article. Because they resigned for such scandals. But these days, there are a lot of funding scandals of statesmen. I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations against that. In the first place, politics is for protecting our lives. So we should originally watch the current status of politics for ourselves. In other words, the scandal was caused due to shortage of awareness regarding politics among nations. So I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations.  i heard this news and was shocking. A bureaucrat and the minister should do appropriate work. Therefore, a third party should supervise them. I think that the third party is people.  When I heard this news, I was not shocked. Because the relation between politics and money has been strongly played up by mass media. In my opinion, it is not good thing in terms of humanity, but in terms of politics, it is no use denying that deed I think this is very sad news because these scandals will stop any good flows of political consequences. There have been many political problems in Japan, so we have no time to attend to these news essentially. And, I also felt these news seems to have an aspect of just power game. This is why I god so sad.  When I heard this news at the first time, l feel angry. The most thing surprised me is Ms. Obuchi 's behavior. The cabinet of Abe is making efforts to enhance the stand of Japanese women, but Ms. Obuchi's action made that situation worse. I can't forgive her behavior as one of Japanese Women I agree with your opinion. I'm fed up with these time of political news recently, and whenever I hear them, I have fears for the Japanese future. Many people also do that, I guess. These matter seem to be bullying of adults.  When I read this article, I felt anger. Recently, I heard news that a statesman spent office money for his private many times. I cannot understand their feelings. I want the Japanese Government to take measures for problems like that, and I hope that another problem like that will not happen.  I cannot allow her behavior too. Although female activity is delightful, I want to lose disgrace. We need to do our best as a Japanese woman of the future! If what Miyazawa said is true, it is not responsible for him but stuff. I think it is a individual problem of the stuff, so Miyazawa does not have to resign.  I agree with you. I cannot forgive that staff from a support group spent office money at a sex club. There are many cases where Japan minister cause a scandal. I hope a scandal like this will not happen again too.  I think so. Funding scandals of politicians are also treachery against the Japanese people. I think confidence in politicians is very important to be engaged in political activity. Therefore they must have more responsibility for their behaviors. Then, I think more people will come to have interest in politics and go to elections.  I agree with you. Mr. Miyazawa's support group wasted office money. Their money is a tax. The law regulates how to spend their money. He was chosen by the voters because they expect him to do what is good for them. They should have wasted their money.  When I heard this news, I felt angry and thought they were not suitable for politician. But recently, I heard yuko Obuchi was allowed to run for election. I think it is citizen's duty to choose the person who is suitable for politician.  I have same opinion. As politicians scandals is revealed, political party lost people's trust. Politicians should behave correctly.  I agree to your opinion. I think the politician to have to be serious for the nation. However, I may not regain the trust of the nation if there is such a scandal. I do not want politicians to raise such a thing with twice.  I agree with your opinion. Some people's financial impropriety is not scruple to lead to suspiciousness against politician entirety. I hope a person of integrity become politician and politician doesn't be faithless.  When I read this article, I was so shocked. I think that they are blinded by self-interest. I wish they work for citizens not for themselves.  I think so too. Politicians are representative of citizens, so they should act with responsibility that they are elected. However, many politicians are lacking responsibility and they make us disappointed. We have to elect carefully.  I was surprised at the news. In these days, I hear a lot of news that Japanese politician use tax in wong ways. Politicians should think about the figure which there should be of the politician. And the corruption of the politician should deal with a heavy punishment I agree with you. I want politicians to make good use of the tax of the country.  Politics and money is an inseparable relationship . Politics needs big money and this money is given by private citizens. So, politician must control his money which use political activity exactly. If he himself doesn't know money which use illegally he must take responsibility for his administrative ability.  I agree to your opinion. And I feel sad when they resign their post because of trifling scandal. So I also think they should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us.  I was disappointed to know this news. They wasted a lot of money collected by people. They had to spend their money to do something good for people supporting them. It is true that they have to collect a lot of money to take part in politics. However, I think that there is something wrong with their political sense. I want politicians to do clean politics.  When I heard the news for the first time, I was disappointed deeply. Certainly, Mr. Miyazawa said he didn't go the club. However, it is not the crux about the problem. What he is to blame for is that he paid money for inappropriate things. This expense just lower his dignity. In order to be a good politician, he should recognize his social position strongly.  I think so. The latest scandals made Japanese people angry. The politicians should have responsible for his work and work hard for the future.  When I read this article, I was surprised that the chief didn't take responsibility. Indeed I was shocked to the fact that abuse was happened , but to me, the most serious incident is responsibility. I think Cheef should take responsibility.  When I heard this news, I was very regrettable. newspaper often report politician's corruption . So I wasn't surprised the news . but I was furious with a politician's using our tax for their entertainment. I think politics and a gold problem are a kind of word in fashion. We should also watch a politician severely now.  I agree to your opinion, too. A politician shouldn't use the political fund privately. I wish for a punish severe on the politician.  There are many cases that Japanese politicians are criticized because of their way to use money these days. In almost all the cases, the money which is used is our tax. I feel anger especially about this. I personally think there should be something like more strict rules about politicians corruptions.  I completely agree with your idea. It is really a shameful thing that Japanese politicians quit their job because of their scandal.  I think so, too. I'm interested how womens' status are enhanced by Abe's policy.  I think so, too. Latest politicians caused politic money problems. They should be responsible for their job.  I think so too. Not only opposition parties but also we, citizens, have to keep watch on activities of the ruling party. To be specific, we should make an organization composed of people regardless of young and old, men and women.  At first I was so disappointed when I read this article. That is because our money is spend to such sex club. But I think there are many problem like this which is not found in public and the problem like this lead to political apathy among the young.  I agree with your opinion. Recently these problem happen many times. These problem lead to political apathy among the young.  I strongly agree with your opinion!! Politician must not use political funding for self-interest. Today, many politician quite there job for scandals. Politician should be responsible for there action more.  I think that Yoichi Miyazawa went a sex club. However the problem is that he used office money for sex club. Including Yoichi Miyazawa , some members of Japanese assembly lack consciousness of being member of it. Much more it is needless to say that a minister should have the consciousness and responsibility.  When I read this news, I felt so funny because Yoichi Miyazawa was too silly. To use office money for sex club is crazy thing and no one allow to do that. We can think easily that to use office money is not be allowed. So he should reflect that.  I agree with you that we should observe offers' act.  I agree with you too. This scandal is too shameful to be a politician. Japanese politicians must gain a people's confidence.  I agree with you. I don't know why such a fool person can get political serious position and I was disgusted by how Japanese politic does not work properly. If this situation continues, Japan will be damaged seriously.  When I read this article, I'm surprised and feel ashamed. It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal. I want politicians to do clean politics.  I strongly agree with your opinion. As long as they politicians get a lot of money as a salary which is mostly composed of our tax, they have to work hard and must not do improper things which look strange from citizens' viewpoint.  I thought that Ms. Obuchi is not related. She has common sense so she can judge herself. this case happen without her. I think so.  This is because I also think recent politicians have no responsibility and must remember the spirit they started with. This is the very thing I have been considering for long time.  I was so disappointed with the news. Also I was disgusted at Japanese politicians because the incidents like this often occur these days. I want to remember the politicians to their pride that they felt when they started so important occupation for all the nation. Also, we should not only criticize the politicians but also participate in the politics.  I strongly agree with this opinion because politician should not use the funding money for their own private use. We cannot trust today's politicians of Japan. We must chose some people who can be responsible for their actions.  I am sure that politicians' funds must be managed carefully. Many politicians receive money from their party for political activities and their party receive money from the government funds. The government funds are composed of national debt and taxes on the nation. Therefore, many politicians receive money from citizens indirectly. In conclusion, politicians' funds are equal to nations' money and it is essential to be managed carefully It is embezzlement to spend the money of the company for the purpose of personal - going to the sexual club. The minister does not accept it, but I think that it is a problem that such an expenditure was done. Minister should take a certain action as one of the people on behalf of a country.  I think so, too. Tax should be used more useful for people who live in the country.  When I read this article, I was surprised so much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In this situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the JT007 bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms. Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more. "
JOC JOC-15B-02N -0.76 "I am against the laws because the laws haven't won sufficient public understanding. As Prime Minister Abe said, this laws have a close connection with our daily lives. So I think it is strange that citizens don't understand it well as sovereigns. I want Prime Minister Abe to explain it more carefully and give us more time to discuss it. The Constitution of Japan declares in its preamble that ""sovereign power resides with the people. "" However the bills have already passed into the laws, so we should think how to treat the laws.  I think these bills must help keeping Japan's peace, people's life, and nation. This bills will be able to make an offer many tactical options of political and military. For example, for these bills, Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) can rush to help private citizens when they are in combat zone. Until now, JSDF couldn't help citizens although native. Today, there are many risk of terrorism over the world and we can't know where terrorism occurred so if peoples are caught terrorism, we have to hold options to help these peoples. On the other hand, JSDF will be able to defense other countries forces, especially US Forces. Japan has the Japan-US Security treaty but this treaty is a little slanted. In recent years, Japan's security environment is being sharper and sharper so Japan government want to build up defense capability by strengthening relationship between Japan and USA. I can understand this thinking. I can supports thinking of these bills, but I oppose its because of the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution. These bills has many defect of consistency from the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution so if government want to get contents of these bills, we should discuss amendment of the Constitution and change the articles.  I agree passed this Controversial security bills because I think there are needs which collective self-defense in a limited way in Japan. Of course, I can understand people who are against the laws. I think Abe haven't won sufficient public understanding too. But I don't understand opinion that railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make dilutions of grandeur I had not have a good image about Shinzo Abe, because he didn't respect the opinions of Japanese and put the law of taxes into force. This time also he passed one law in force without Japanese's opinions, so I cannot come to like him. His decision about Japanese security bills must change its safety, so it is natural that the Japanese get angry. This Abe's eloquent but ambiguous speech had directed Japan to war again, I think. In addition, I think that Prime Minister Abe should make his opinion clearly for the Japanese. Probably, they aren't be convinced, but they can think a little that he has no choice in security bills. This his betting is so risky and might break people's life someday.  When I heard about the bill for the first time, I disagreed with the right of collective self-defense because it will lead Japan to be involved in a war. However, as I investigated about the right for myself, I could fully understand the right and the bill, I changed my idea to agree with the bill. I realized that the right will be used under limited conditions, so it won't lead Japan to be in danger and also it help to strength the connection between Japan and the USA for the world safety and that of Japan it self. In my opinion, the prime minister Abe should have explained more about the bill and the right of collective self-defense which it includes. If he explains detail about the bill to the public, more and more people will be convinced and stop to abject to the action of the Diet. I hope the prime minister Abe to consider more about his situation and be conscious about the citizen. Anyway, this bill changed the Japan's defense policy and is the turning point of its history.  I agree with your opinion. I also think that Abe should talk about his opinion more clearly for people's agreement. I don't like his action to pass the bill firmly without paying attention to the public opinion. There was demonstration in front of the Diet for several weeks to show their opposition to the bill, so Abe must have known about the circumstance in Japan. He has to deal with the public who still disagrees with the bill. It is the problem for entire nation, so it should not be ignored.  I agree with your opinion. It was strange that the governing bloc put the security bills to a vote before negotiations between representatives from ruling and opposition parties and gaining the understanding of the citizens. It was no exaggeration to say that the bills was rammed through the Diet. It is contrary to democracy. Prime Minister Abe were too hasty in passing security-related bills into law. The theme is very important because it will have a big influence on our future. So, I wanted Abe to listen to citizens' voices more seriously. I'm afraid democracy in Japan is becoming a mere name.  I was hearing on the spot the vote in peace special committee of the House of Councilors. While people didn't know what happened the bill passed. It isn't good that this important bill pass in this way. They should not submit together some bills in a hurry. They should discuss each bills carefully and pass them. They need to assess what Japan needs to do or not to do. But It isn't good to opposite simply. We should go next selection and express our ideas.  I don't agree your opinion because government explain the content of the law and also mass communications reported many information(put thought true or false). Even if you can't understand the bill's content, it is your shortage of studying. Now there are internet and there are many information about it, so if you can't understanding you should research in internet. Join the politics is the duty of nations. You should study from now I agree with you. This bill make Japan's security more safety and stronger. Japan self defense forces have more way them action and it means our security level will go up. Recently, Japan's security environment is going to be sharper and sharper especially in the East Asia. It is better that we have many way to be able to do military action. I also agree with your opinion about railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make delusions of grandeur. Making the way to security stronger is the natural for nation.  I sure this problem is the most difficult recently and I cannot expect what happens from now on. In Japan, It was a pro and con but Because LDP forced a vote, LDP receive much criticism. To be frank, I think it is natural. I was not able to believe they forced a vote though the Diet is so desolate, you know. By the way, this security bill has the good aspect and the bad aspect, I think. Now there are various menaces in the world. So it is necessary to cooperate between countries, and to get over it. This bill promises it and It is convenient with the aspect. But the other hand, we may be rolled up in the war of other countries. Japan promise not to do not make war in constitution Article 9. However, we may break the promise by the security bills. There is no way for us to know what will happen to it. Young people must make an effort not to worsen. I think that it is up to us.  I oppose right of collective self-defense. It's because I think there is a possibility that a war starts with using this law. Prime Minister Abe denies its possibility, but I think you retaliate certainly when attacking a partner to protect the people. And I think that's repeated. Japan is very peaceful now, so I think I don't want to break this living. And I'm opposite to how to make them do formation of this law. I think the explanation to Prime Minister Abe's people and other councilors wasn't enough. I thought I wanted you to establish after I spent time and convinced the people and other councilors more.  I am not against this law but, they should have made the opportunity to discuss about this matter more. Prime Minister Abe cannot avoid being criticized, because I don't think he stepped the right process. I had a opportunity to talk with the professor Mr. Hosoya in Keio University. He is the professor in department of Political Science. He explained us the details about the security bill over an hour and I was pretty convinced by his explanation. So I think if they explain more explicitly for Japanese nations, there might have not be the demonstrations against the law. "
ACA ACA-CMA-001 -0.69 "THE DEVELOPMENT OF DARWIN'S GENERAL BIOLOGICAL THEORIZING M.J.S. HODGE Charles Darwin (1809–1882) was only twenty seven when he returned, in 1836, from the five-year voyage of HMS Beagle . What is more, within the next five years he reached all those conclusions in general biological theory that his books were to expound three decades later. For, by 1841, he had worked out not only his theory of the origin of species,natural selection , but also, it seems, his theory of generation (or reproduction, including heredity, variation and so on),pangenesis . This chapter surveys the development of his general biological theorizing over that remarkable early period. The analysis draws throughout on the work done in the last decade by Gruber (1974), Herbert (1974, 1977), Ghiselin (1975), Ruse (1975a, b; 1979), Schweber (1977, 1980), Kottler (1978), Manier (1978), Sulloway (1979, 1982a, b), Kohn (1980), Ospovat (1981), and Sloan (1983a, b) and is derived from studies by the present writer (Hodge, 1982, 1986; Hodge & Kohn, 1986) where full reference is made to the documentary sources and secondary literature. Such a survey can serve more than mere biographical curiosity, and a final section will suggest how it may clarify some issues of current interest to historians, to philosophers and to biologists. It can also free us from many mistaken myths about Darwin himself. These myths mostly trace to his own misleading reminiscences later in life, and have been relentlessly reaffirmed since, at the 1959 centennial symposia for example and in the 1978 BBC-TV series on Darwin; but they are nonetheless discredited by the scholarly industry now grown up around the rich manuscript archive from Darwin's early years (Kohn, 1986). One is the romantic, really Wordsworthian, individualist myth so dear to the literary guardians of English national cultural stereotypes. It depicts the young Darwin as a lone, sporting gentleman, an amateur beetle-collector  seeing nature as she really is by simply looking with the clear gaze of genius, unimpeded by any scientific training, theological prejudice, professional ambition and so on. Another is the Whiggish, anachronistic myth that Darwin's general biological thought consists of a molecule comprising just two atoms: the idea of evolution and the idea of natural selection. It depicts his early intellectual development as reducing to two moments of discovery, whereby he moves from having no coherent ideas to having just those ideas. Fortunately, there is a single antidote effective against both these myths;, and that is to start all over again with the most decisive source of Darwin's new identity, on the voyage, as a committed man of science: his zealous discipleship of Charles Lyell's (1797–1875) views in geology (including biogeography and ecology). This antidote is effective against the romantic-individualist myth, because, as a protégé of Lyell, the young Darwin of the Beagle is at once invested with all the intellectual and institutional context that that myth would suppress. It is effective against the evolution-plus-natural-selection myth, because it forces us to reconstruct the narrative of his subsequent theorizing not as so many unknowing steps towards his final positions, but as so many deliberate departures from positions initially shared with his mentor. Darwin as a protégé of Lyell (1834–7) Darwin's acceptance of Lyell's views was complete by mid-1834 when he sailed around the Horn. Having now studied all three volumes of the Principles of Geology (1830–3), he was applying Lyell's entire system, physical and organic worlds alike, to South America and beyond that the whole earth. Henceforth this system provided the framework for his preoccupation with the problems of the extinction and origin of species. All the causes of change are presumed, in Lyell's system, to persist undiminished into the present, the human period, and on into the future. Now, as at all times, habitable dry land is being destroyed by subsidence and erosion in some regions, while it is being produced by sediment consolidation, lava eruption and elevationary earthquake action in others. Equally, Lyell has the long succession of faunas and floras brought about by a continual, one-by-one extinction of species and their replacement by new ones. The epistemological rationale for his presumption, of the persistence of all such causes of change into the present and future, is the ideal of  explanation by real or existing causes,verae causae . Like his friend (and the undergraduate Darwin's scientific hero) the physicist John Herschel (1792–1871), Lyell followed earlier writers, most notably the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid (1710–1796), who had drawn this moral from the superior evidential credentials of the Newtonian gravitational force over the Cartesian ethereal vortices: any causes invoked in an explanatory theory should, ideally, be known to exist through direct observation independently of the facts they are supposed to explain. That force, unlike those vortices, was a well-evidenced explanation for the planets' orbits because, the argument went, the orbits themselves were not the sole evidence for its existence. It was a real not a conjectural cause; for it was known to exist from observations of swinging pendulums and falling stones down here on earth. Lyell's system was, therefore, to exemplify an epistemological analogy. In geology, only causes active in the present, human period are accessible in principle, although often not in practice, to direct observation. So, in this science, the present is to the past as the terrestrial is to the celestial in Newtonian physical astronomy. Such, then, was the context, at once systematic and epistemological wherein Darwin, from 1834 on, was theorizing about species extinctions and origins. His own thinking over the next three years was developed, accordingly, through successive disagreements with Lyell's views on the organic world, while he continued to accept his mentor's teaching on the physical world of land, sea and climate changes. Lyell had made adaptational considerations alone completely decisive in determining the timing and placing of both species extinctions and species origins. Any species must eventually become extinct; for changes in local conditions will sooner or later allow other species better adapted to the changed conditions to invade and conquer in the struggle for existence. As for species origins, Lyell had argued against spontaneous generation and against new species arising by the modification (‘transmutation’) of older ones. But, in offering no positive alternative account, he had left the means whereby new species originate quite mysterious if not miraculous. He had held explicitly, however, that when and where any given species is created is determined by the conditions it needs to flourish. Conversely, the character and so the supraspecific group membership of the species that have originated in any area is determined by conditions there. So, on Lyell's account, if two areas are very similar in conditions they will have congeneric or cofamilial endemic species; if they are very dissimilar, then their endemic species will be of distinct families or orders. Now, by early spring 1837, Darwin had decided that such purely adaptational explanations could not account adequately for the timing and placing of either the extinctions of old species or the origins of new ones. And he was emphasizing, in his Red Notebook , the parallel in the explanatory inadequacy of adaptation in the two cases (Herbert, 1980). Already, in 1835, he had concluded that several species of large mammals, formerly flourishing on the eastern plains of South America, had later become extinct while no change in conditions physical or ecological had occurred. And he had adopted another theory of extinction, discussed but rejected by Lyell, wherein species are like individuals and die of old age. A species, as a succession of organisms produced sexually, might have only a limited total lifetime, Darwin argued; just as a succession of apple trees propagated by grafts was supposed to last only so long before degenerating and dying as if it were merely the extension of a single limited life. As for the origin of species, reflection on many palaeontological and biogeographical facts, including those established by the expert judgments of Richard Owen and John Gould on the voyage material, had convinced Darwin, by early spring 1837, that the close similarity seen between any congeneric endemic species in two areas was not always explicable as a common adaptation to common conditions; for often the two sets of species were endemic in areas with very different climate, soil and so on. However, if more recent species could descend from earlier ones, ancestry could explain what adaptation could not. Why did the species on younger land — the Galapagos islands or the southern Patagonian plains, for instance— often resemble closely other species on the nearest older land? Because they were descended from them, many sometimes descending from a single ancestral species. Thus did Darwin conclude that resemblances between species are often not due to adaptation but to inheritance from common ancestors; while differences are often adaptive and are due to differing, multiple divergences from those common ancestors. It is not, as he saw it, that species are not exquisitely adapted to their respective places in the economy of nature. They are and any theory of species origins must explain why. It is simply that adaptation and ancestry can explain what adaptation alone can not. On such grounds Darwin had decided, by that spring, for transmutation and common descent. Always the bold ‘philosopher’ as much as the cautious ‘naturalist’, he soon went far beyond these disagreements with Lyell. He did so in a new sequence of theoretical notebooks, B-E (1837–9) and M- N (1838–9)— M for ‘metaphysics’, meaning mind, man, materialism, morals and so on. (See  a note at the end of this chapter on editions of these texts.) He did so, moreover, in two ways that were consciously conditioned from the start by his immediate context and resources in 1837 as a biological theorist. First, from way back in his Edinburgh days and his apprenticeship to Robert Grant in invertebrate zoology, he had been much pre-occupied with comprehensive generalizations about sexual and asexual modes of generation (Sloan, personal communication). His extinction theorizing had thus been developed, since 1835, at the first intersection of that old preoccupation with his newer devotion to Lyellian geology. Now, in the summer of 1837, he would understand the origins no less than the extinctions of species through appropriate comparisons and contrasts between sexual and asexual generation. Having read again a book he had admired when studying at Edinburgh, a book much concerned with precisely such comparisons and contrasts — his grandfather Brasmus Darwin's Zoönomia (1794–6)— he was soon taking its title for the opening heading of his Notebook B , where he was now to pursue his own inquiry into ‘the laws of life’. He was soon making explicit, too, a fundamental teleological analogy, in which changing conditions are to sexual generation as sexual crossing is to asexual generation. Although it can extend an individual life, continued grafting eventually brings death without issue; and likewise sexual generation in unchanging conditions brings death, extinction of the species, without issue. With sexual crossing, however, an individual whose life has been extended by grafting, although not enabled to go on itself, can give rise to a new individual with a new lease on life. Likewise, then, in changing conditions, sexual generation is the providential means whereby a species can change into another, a new species adapted to the new conditions, so avoiding the extinction without issue that would otherwise occur. Second, Lyell had outlined very fully — and of course rejected — the comprehensive transmutationist system of biology developed by jean Lamarck, praising the French zoologist for his courage in extending his repugnant ideas to our own species, man. Darwin accordingly opened his Notebook B , in July 1837, with an integrated sequence of entries whose twenty-seven pages of argumentation were to match the structure of Lyell's exposition of Lamarck. Darwin, like Lamarck — as presented (and misrepresented) by Lyell — would now trace any degrees of difference, no matter how wide, to long-run divergences from common stocks. And he would trace any higher levels of bodily organization and mental faculties, explicitly including those in man, to long-run progress from remote starting points in the simplest organisms of all, infusorian monads. With these decisions Darwin became more than the protégé of Lyell. He  would be ever hereafter his own successor in developing sequels to the steps he had taken in the spring and summer of 1837. The new programme pursued (1837–8) Darwin himself often reflected in his notebooks on his new programme's presuppositions concerning God, nature, man and science. God was, for Darwin then, still the traditional good and wise creator, but one never working in so many separate acts of miraculous interference, always through the natural consequences of a few initial enactments of general causal laws: as with planetary orbits and the law of gravitation, so, Darwin insisted, with species origins and the laws of generation. As for man, he is a species produced like any other, lawfully, his mental faculties the causal consequences of his bodily organization and not miraculously superadded; while science is a quest for lawful causes that are evidenced both directly and independently of the many, diverse facts they can explain, and indirectly and dependently, by the very multitude and diversity of those facts. The place in the programme of his generational theory of species origins Darwin understood through the analogy of a tree of life. By the autumn of 1837, he had developed this analogy so as to understand all long-run trends in diversification and progress through an arboriform extrapolation, on a changing but stable Lyellian earth's surface, of successive species propagations; these being analogous to the successive bud propagations whereby any tree grows, with many buds ending without branching, in species extinctions, while other buds branch without ending, in species multiplications. His species propagation theorizing itself was accordingly constructed, from the very opening of Notebook B , as an argument that starts with the sexual generation of one individual organism from another and ends with the propagation of one species from another. Moreover, this species propagation is ultimately made possible by the two features that Darwin sees distinguishing sexual from asexual generation: namely, maturation in the offspring and the interaction of two parents in their production. Thanks to the impressionability of immature organization, hereditary adaptive variation accompanies sexual generation in changing conditions. But how then can any species be constant in character across its entire range? Because crossing with the blending of parental characters keeps the species constant as long as the conditions are constant overall, only changing temporarily and locally. Conversely, then, a new variety can be  formed if this conservative action of crossing is circumvented by reproductive isolation of a few individuals in new conditions, whether that isolation arises with or without geographical segregation. And how may this variety formation proceed to new species formation.) As Darwin knew, the usual criteria for specific rather than mere varietal distinctions were those that Swedes and Italians do not satisfy, but lions and tigers do: namely, true breeding, lack of intermediate forms and unwillingness or inability to produce fertile hybrids on crossing. So, the final stage in Darwin's argumentation concerns how a species meeting those three criteria would eventually arise with prolonged isolation and divergence. Over the next year, through the summer of 1838, it is the variety and species formation stages of this argument that Darwin develops most fully and explicitly. The character gaps between good species he explains by continued divergence and by the extinction of intermediate varieties. The true breeding he explains by the law that in crossing the characters of an older domestic race dominate those of a younger one. This dominance shows, Darwin reasons, that older characters are more permanent, more deeply embedded in the hereditary constitution and so more resistant to the influence either of mates in crossing or of changing external conditions. Such permanent divergences in character have often arisen in the distinct races of a domesticated species, and in the wild they would be accompanied by an unwillingness or inability to interbreed; for there, Darwin argues, the reproductive system, with the associated instincts, is not disrupted as it is in domesticated species. So, for Darwin, in the early summer of 1838, the races of domesticated species are providing positive analogies, especially for the final, species formation, steps in his argument. But at the other, the opening end of that argument, concerning the initiation and transmission of adaptive change, they are a source of contrasts and not of comparison. Thus he says that many varieties of domesticated species, fancy pigeon breeds for example, are monstrous not adaptive; they can only be maintained by artificial feeding and breeding, including selective breeding; they are quite unlike wild, natural and adaptive varieties and even more unlike wild species. Now, as Darwin sees it, at this time, for a change to be an adaptation it must be more than merely hereditary and advantageous; it must be necessary rather than accidental, elicited, that is, by the very conditions that make it advantageous, as albinism sometimes seems to be by cold. And it must be acquired by the whole of the race faced with those conditions, so as not to be lost in crossing. Then, as with reproductive isolation, changed habits can initiate permanent adaptive changes in structure, especially in higher animals by entailing changes in the conditions of foetal maturation. All these developments, in Darwin's comprehensive species propagation argumentation, are reinforced and not rejected in further developments, consummated in mid-September, 1838, in his Notebook D conjectures about sexual and asexual generation, more particularly about sexual buds (or ova) and asexual buds. A sexual bud or ovum has started life, he supposes, as a bud from the mother when she was herself a newly fertilized egg in her mother, the grandmother. Why then does it not eventually become an exact facsimile of that mother? Because, he answers, of two lots of differences. During its maturation it is subject to conditions not exactly like those the mother matured in; and at fertilization it is acted on by a mate with a constitution unlike its own and unlike its mother's. The whole object of sex is to have unlike acting on unlike so as to make possible the production of unlike offspring, thus allowing for adaptive change, Darwin argues. But where does the constitutional unlikeness of the two mates come from? Well, since each has the same ancestry, their constitutional difference must trace to the cumulative influence of different conditions in the two lines of descent from those ancestors. So, sexual generation is the means whereby the past influences of changing conditions can be accumulated and combined with present ones to ensure continued variability. If conditions change only locally and temporarily then only individual differences will result, but, Darwin concludes, if conditions change overall and permanently then a new species will eventually be formed. Darwin is pleased with this novel analysis of how sex enables new species to arise from old. But he admits that it leaves as mysterious as in 1837, how the maturation of the individual fertilized ovum ensures that the changes be adaptive in each generation. He can only conjecture that additional maturational innovations will not become hereditary unless they harmonize with the previous ones that are already being recapitulated in maturation. Adaptive innovations could thus be separated, as the ones that are hereditarily transmitted, from the maladaptive, as the ones that are not; although Darwin notes that hereditary diseases show that this separation is often fallible. Such is Darwin's species origin theorizing in mid-September 1838. It compounds still further those two legacies so actively conjoined since the  previous summer of 1837: the historical, biogeographical (including ecological) concerns that he had inherited from Lyell, and the generational concerns deriving from his study with Grant and subsequent reading in Erasmus Darwin. Consider, then, what geography and generation together have done for Darwin's understanding of the problems of organic diversity and the origin of species. First, his explanation of resemblances and differences among species contrasts directly with any developmental stage theorizing as found most famously in Robert Chambers, Herbert Spencer or Karl Marx. A developmental stage theory refers similarities and differences to more-or-less-equal advances made from the lowest point on a universal scale of advance. Thus Chambers explains the similarities between Old and New World monkeys as due to life having advanced to the same level of organization from quite independent origins of life in the two hemispheres (Hodge, 1972). By contrast, for Darwin as a genealogical (ancestry and descent) theorist of historical biogeography, resemblances and differences are not traced to developmental advances, but to ramifying migrations and adaptive divergences from common ancestors that are more or less remote from their diverse descendants in time, place and character. Now, Darwin at this time is explicitly taking each organism's ontogeny to recapitulate its phylogeny. But his very assumption that many descendant species may diverge from a single common ancestry precludes his construing descendants as grown-up ancestors and ancestors as descendants in embryo; for any given immature, embryonic life already has but one determinate mature adult future; if a puppy as a dog, if a tadpole as a frog. It is, then, because he is explaining differences and resemblances as he is that Darwin, in 1838, needs a theory of purely opportunistic adaptive change in changing conditions, a theory making no developmentalist assumption as to a preferred direction that life will take provided it can go on at all. And his thinking is indeed knowingly premised on the assumption that in the complete absence of change in conditions there would be no changes in organization; so that whatever different changes in organization have occurred in the many lines descending from some common stock are due to differences in the conditions in those lines. Darwin, as a genealogical biogeographer, thinking horizontally as well as vertically, to use Ernst Mayr's (1982) terms, would explain change generationally but not developmentally. This integration of horizontal, genealogical, geographical and  generational constraints is also the source for what Ernst Mayr (1982) calls Darwin's populationist thinking about species. For it has led Darwin to think of each species as spreading out into varying conditions, over a range, over time. And only the extension of a species, not its intension, as philosophers say — only the collective membership of a species, not the properties earning the members their membership in it — can have a geographical range and a historical career. Now, recall his account of individual adaptations to conditions as arising in individual maturations in sexual generation; and recall his account of hereditary variation as embedded constitutionally through successive individual matings. And then it is clear how Darwin has come to be thinking of a species as a population of individuals, with each member differing from every other because arising in a unique sequence of influences exerted by a unique succession of conditions and mates. The origins of natural selection and pangenesis (1838–42) Darwin's mid-September 1838 theorizing, as developed in his Notebook D , provided the immediate context for his most celebrated innovation of all: the theory of natural selection. For — contrary to the legend that it was all thought through in a day — this theory was worked out in three main stages over the next half year. The first stage involved only the opening steps in Darwin's overall argumentation from individual generation to species formation. For it sees him changing his mind about the adaptiveness of structural change rather than about species formation as such. This first stage did come on reading Thomas Malthus's (1766 — 1834)Essay on the Principle of Population,on 28 September 1838; after a generational conjecture — that higher animal foetuses are initially hermaphrodite — had led him to Adolphe Quetelet's findings on the sex ratio at birth and so, it seems, to Malthus as an author linked by a reviewer with the Belgian social statistician (Schweber, 1977). Now, what Darwin's reflections on Malthus did was to move him away from a prenatal, maturational sorting of adaptive from maladaptive variation. For he moved at once to a post-natal, ecological sorting wherein individual adaptive variants are retained, while the maladaptive are eliminated in the Malthusian crush of population. These initial reflections did not include, then, any analogy between artificially and naturally selective breeding. But Darwin did draw an explicit analogy between this teleology — of population pressure and  sorting, as ensuring adaptation of plant and animal structure to changing conditions — and Malthus's theistic teleology of superfecundity, as ensuing the energetic dispersal of ancient tribes beyond the original Asian seat of the human species. Man, naturally slothful according to Malthus, only spread into more adverse climes thanks to the local scarcities of food entailed by his excess fertility; with later settlers always eventually victorious because made doubly energetic in struggling with both rigorous conditions and previous settlers. Alien species beating natives on their home ground had been decisive for Lyell's species extinction theorising, where the analogy with the European human conquests over America Indians was explicit. Colonizing species of alien genera doing likewise had long been decisive for Darwin's species origin theorizing, where the analogy with the European human conquests over Australasian natives was hardly less explicit. Throughout 1838, Darwin had been allowing for Lyellian competitive defeats to extinguish some species before their predetermined ageing overcame them. Now, his Malthusian reflections prompted both a new ecological understanding of adaptive sorting and a final return to Lyellian ecology for all extinctions. Thus did ecological explanations regain ground earlier lost to generational ones. The second stage began around the end of November 1838. For Darwin then drew his first explicit analogies between adaptation in wild species and the fitness for human ends of domestic races, as both due to selective breeding. To make this new comparison Darwin had to drop his old contrast between monstrous, selected, domestic races and adaptive, not selected, wild species. He dropped it first, it seems, on considering sporting-dog breeds, notably greyhounds; for these, although formed by the human artifice of selective breeding, had been given both structures and instincts useful in the wild. (Hence the carnivorous canines In Darwin's later thought-experiments on natural selection.) Up to now, domestic race formation had provided Darwin only with analogies for the formation of wild species as ancient, true breeding and intersterile races. With this new selective breeding analogy, domestic races, as adaptations, are also providing analogies for the formation of wild species as ancient and perfectly adapted races. The third stage came seemingly early in 1839, when this new analogy prompted a further revision to the opening steps of the overall argumentation. In artificial selection, the chosen end, for which the race is being fitted, does not elicit the variation being selected. So, Darwin reasoned, natural selection likewise could work with variation that is accidentally  rather than necessarily adaptive. If changes in conditions disrupt the precise replication of parental characters so as to yield hereditary variation, then, providing only that some of it happens to be adaptive, this will suffice in the long run for selection as a cause of adaptive species formations. With these developments beyond his mid-September 1838 positions, Darwin had reached the theory of natural selection much as he would publish it later. In March 1839, he even outlined the argumentative structure that opens his Sketch of 1842 (F. Darwin, 1909), the first, manuscript, version of The Origin of Species (1859). By 1841, he had very probably worked out, also, his later theory of individual organism generation: pangenesis. The theory, as eventually set forth (1868), was constituted by two theses: that the generative material comes from all over the parent body or bodies, and that it consists of minute ‘gemmules’ budded off from every part. Darwin's preoccupation with generation went back to Edinburgh and to consequent inquiry, when on the voyage, into modes of reproduction common to various invertebrate groups (Sloan, personal communication). In early 1837, he had supported the senescence analogy between sexual and asexual generation by interpreting all generation as division, whether artificial or natural, complete or incomplete, simultaneous or successive. This thesis, that all generation is division, continued throughout the B, C and D notebooks and was reinforced by an explicit equating, in September 1838, of division and gemmation or budding. The equation made all generation, sexual or otherwise, a form of budding. However, in his theorizing about sexual generation, as being unique in allowing variation and adaptation, Darwin made a fundamental distinction between sexual buds, such as ova, and asexual buds. According to this distinction, all and only sexual buds are involved in maturation and fertilization. Consequently all and only sexual buds are impressionable, whether by the action of changed conditions or by a sexual element from a mate of unlike constitution. Conversely, while lacking those powers an asexual bud, or even a severed flatworm fragment, can do what an unfertilized ovum can not: namely, produce a whole organism without interactive collaboration with any other part; this power being credited by Darwin to the presence in such a bud or fragment, indeed in any healing flesh, of material determining growth for all the parts of the whole organism. Switching now from 1838 to 1868, one sees, in direct contrast with this earlier view, that a principal object of pangenesis is to explain how in all generation, sexual and asexual, the powers are the same and so, too, the material. To this end, Darwin adduces, most especially, those phenomena  that would be anomalous for any exclusive correlation of maturation, fertilization and impressionability with sexual rather than asexual modes of generation. Thus aphid parthenogenesis shows an unfertilized ovum producing a maturing organism with no prior interaction with a male element; again, so-called graft hybrids and the effects of pollen on non-germinal tissue in a female plant both show impressionability without fertilization and maturation; while sporting and reversion in asexual plant buds show variation without fertilization or maturation. So, as contrasted with his September 1838 position, Darwin sees pangenesis as an evening up, on both sides, of all the powers of the sexual and asexual parts of any organism. Pangenesis is itself presented as a theory of how this identity of powers arises in development. In a developing organism, starting as a fertilized egg, each cell or tissue, throughout its own maturation, is budding off miniature facsimiles of itself, the ‘gemmules’. The whole organism can then have, as an adult, the same powers in its asexual buds and its sexual organs, because the same material is there: namely, ‘gemmules’ collected from all over the body. These gemmules have, accordingly, been invested by Darwin with two sorts of properties: those credited to every asexual part of the body, in 1838, to explain its generative and regenerative powers, and those invoked then to explain the impressionability and variability of immature ova. So, pangenesis could have been derived from the 1838 position, by pandynamic extension to the ova of powers previously denied to them, and by a panovulational extension to all other parts of powers and matters formerly reserved for the ovary. But is that, in fact, how Darwin arrived at pangenesis? No known document confirms that it was. But all the indirect evidence, including the records of his reading in such writers on generation as Erasmus Darwin, Johannes Müller and Giorgio Gallesio, makes it most probable that he came to pangenesis in such a revision of his 1838 position, and that he did so in the years 1840–1. However and whenever it was first formulated, this pangenetic reduction of every mode of generation to micro-ovulo-gemmation could take inheritance, in so far as it was completely conservative, to be effected by an exact replication of a whole in all its parts; so that variation, reversion and so on are explicable as disturbances, suspensions and complications of that fundamental replicative tendency. Thus could pangenesis unify all Darwin's generation theorizing from gemmules to organisms and on to species, and beyond them the whole tree of life. Pangenesis was never, however, to meet the vera causa evidential ideal, as Darwin himself was keenly aware, and he published it only after natural selection had been launched unencumbered by any such conjectural causation for generation. The argument of the 1842 Sketch (and so, too, of the Origin ) was knowingly structured to accord with that vera causa ideal (Hodge, 1977). The existence of natural selection as a causal agency is evidenced first; then its adequacy to produce new species from old is argued by analogy from the ability of artificial selection, although much less precise and prolonged, to produce domestic races. Finally, Darwin displays the indirect evidence for the theory: the explanations it provides for a wide array of facts in biogeography, geology, embryology and so on. With the 1842 Sketch written, Darwin's most creative period was ended. That year he moved out of London to the Kent countryside and was henceforth mainly writing books, raising children and nursing his health. He never had another fundamentally novel idea in general biological theory. But then he had already had enough to keep him and many others occupied for a very long time. The nature of Darwin's science Even this brief analysis of Darwin's biological theorizing in these early years suggests the following conclusions about the nature of his science in its formative phase. The social context . The traditional way to connect Darwin's science with his society is through Malthus's laissez faire political economy. But this cannot be adequate. A capitalism connection is relevant in the 1840s and 1850s when Darwin is applying division of labour theory to the problems of divergence (Schweber, 1980; Ospovat, 1981). But in 1838 it was Malthus's theodicy of ancient empires, not his political economy of the modern state that bore decisively on Darwin's biogeography and ecology (Bowler, 1976). More generally, any laissez faire connection helps very little in understanding how Darwin came to take up the problems his theorizing was to solve. Here it is his family, especially his grandfather, and his mentor Lyell, that indicate connections with movements of thought directly linked with fundamental social change. Erasmus Darwin, a Birmingham Lunar Society man, belonged to a provincial movement of ‘radical’ dissent from national and metropolitan orthodoxies in politics and religion. Lyell was a ‘liberal’ Scots Whig very much in the Edinburgh Review tradition of John Playfair and his own father-in-law Leonard Horner, a tradition bent on using  electoral and educational, including university, reforms to break the national and metropolitan hegemony of the Tory, Oxonian, Anglican establishment. It is in such mediating contexts, rather than in any direct tie to capital through laissez faire , that the social history of Darwin's science should be sought. Laws, causes and chances. To Darwin, natural selection, as a causal agency and lawful process, was akin, in its vera causa credentials, to gravitational force in celestial mechanics. But his earliest critics often judged his theorizing not to match the standards set by Newtonian physics (Hull, 1973). Was Darwin, then, mistaken in so relating his own science to Newton's? He was, in so far as he underestimated the implications of one major disanalogy: he had no law that was to natural selection as the Newtonian inverse square law (with proportionality to mass products) was to gravitational attraction. For this disanalogy arose from another: Darwin's natural selection as a lawn process was complex, being compounded from heredity, variation and superfecundity, each of those processes having its own laws; while Newton's gravitational force was not compound and had a single law of its own. Now, from these disanalogies arose a further one. In simple cases, the consequences in certain conditions of Newtonian gravitational attraction could be deduced and the adequacy of this cause for certain phenomena, most notably elliptical planetary orbits, thereby established. By contrast, the consequences and so competences, and hence the adequacies or inadequacies, of natural selection, especially for long-run effects, were practically impossible to decide, at least for a finite intellect; although the young Darwin himself could consistently suppose that God in choosing this means for adapting life to a changing earth had foreseen all its consequences. However, although these disanalogies were fundamental, Darwin's theorizing had not taken him out of the causal, lawful, deterministic Newtonian universe, into one as irreducibly acausal and absolutely probabilistic as is sometimes thought implicit in quantum mechanics. Any natural selection involves differential reproductive success that is nonfortuitous because determined by the way variant organisms are interacting with an environment that is causally sensitive to those particular physical differences in the organisms. If more red than green members of a species of moth living on green foliage are being killed by predators, that may be selection; but only if the predators are not  colour-blind; if they are it is random sampling error. But even when killed by colour-blind predators the moths are not victims of any capricious cosmic indeterminacy; for each of their deaths is a causally determined event. It is only as deaths of red or green moths in that environment that these are fortuitous events; this fortuitousness being, as philosophers say, description relative. Again, as Darwin saw it, the chanciness of hereditary variation is relative, not absolute. The processes generating this variation he supposed to be lawful, causal and so determinate; but not causally sensitive to environmental conditions in such a way that any particular change in conditions elicits an increased supply of those variants that are adaptive in the new conditions. So, the distinctions decisive for Darwin's account of the generation and the fate of variation are distinctions drawn within the presuppositions of a deterministic universe. In its dependence on those presuppositions his biology was more like statistical than either celestial or quantum mechanics (Hull, 1974). The non-tautologousness of natural selection . Darwin's vera causa argumentation shows that natural selection is not tautologous for one reason, ultimately. The definitional question, of what natural selection is, can be answered by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence, namely hereditary variation that is causally relevant to reproductive success thanks to organism-environment interactions; it can, then, be answered without begging in advance of empirical inquiry all those further questions as to whether these conditions are ever met: whether, that is, any natural selection exists; and, if so, how it is distributed, what it can do now and what it has been responsible for in the past. It is, then, a mistake to defend natural selection against the tautology objection by proposing criteria of fitness independent of reproductive success. Fitness differences are best understood as reproductive expectancy differences analogous to normalized life expectancy differences. And as such they have no causal or explanatory power of their own. If Jones has outlived Smith this cannot be explained by showing that he earlier had the higher life expectancy, and then arguing that this duly caused him to live the longer life. It can be explained by citing earlier physical differences; perhaps Jones jogged while Smith smoked. Likewise, in natural selection it is physical differences, not the differences in reproductive expectancies estimated from them, that can cause and can explain subsequent reproductive performance differences. As differing expectancies, fitnesses can neither cause reproductive  performance differences nor be definitionally equated with them. So, natural selection is no untestable tautology, but not because fitness measurements, as expectancy estimates, can sometimes be falsified by later performance measurements. Natural selection is no tautology, because there is no a priori proof, from its definition alone, for its existence, nor then for its prevalence, or its adequacy or its responsibility for evolution. If there were, then the last decade and a half of selectionist-neutralist controversies over all these different non-definitional issues could have been settled in advance without recourse to empirical data, in an armchair with a scientist's glossary and a logician's truth table. As Michael Ruse observes (1981) if selectionism is a tautology, neutralism is a contradiction, Darwin's strategy in structuring his argumentation to conform to the vera causa ideal shows why it is not. Evolution, cytology, genetics and the unification of nineteenth-century biological theory . Early in 1900, the doyen of Columbia University biology, E. B. Wilson, introduced the new second edition of his treatise,The Cell , by arguing that the main challenge then facing biological science was to integrate its two greatest achievements in the past century: the theory of evolution and the theory of cells. And he explained why he saw August Weismann's theory of the continuity of the germ plasm as the most promising foundation for any such integration. Wilson's position makes sense of a great deal in the history of general biological theory before and since 1900. It has often been said that the decisive development since Darwin was a new synthesis, in the 1920s and 1930s, of Mendel on heredity and Darwin on selection. Wilson brings out the importance of that earlier and no less fundamental post-Darwinian synthesis, which this later one presupposed: the synthesis of evolution and cytology. Since Wilson's teachings were a principal inspiration for the Morgan school, the twentieth century science of genetics may be said to have arisen within his Weismannist programme for the integration of evolutionary and cytological theorizing (Mayr, 1982). Darwin's integration of evolutionary and physiological biology had been attempted, in the 1840s, through pangenesis. But pangenesis was not reconcilable with the cytological consensus just emerging when Darwin published it a quarter of a century later. Physiologists were then increasingly agreeing that every cellular organism is either a single cell or a cell colony arising from the successive divisions of a single cell, and that two cells come together to form one at fertilization, each having arisen by the division of one cell in the respective parent body. In Darwin's version pangenesis could not be squared with these  cytological generalizations; for, if each of the two masses of gemmules coming together at fertilization is taken to be one cell, then it has not arisen in the division of one cell in that parent; while, if each is taken to be a myriad of cells, then far too many are coming together at fertilization. The problem of transforming Darwin's pangenetic theory to square it with cytology in general, and with Weismann's theory in particular , was taken up most systematically by De Vries; and later developments leading to the theory of the gene were to owe much to his solution: ‘intracellular pangenesis’. So, Darwin's attempt to integrate evolutionary and physiological biology contributed indirectly to the unification that was called for in Wilson's 1900 programme and that genetics was to secure. That Darwin's ideas could have such manifold influence throughout the entire structure of modern biological theory should not now be surprising. Compulsive, selfconscious intellectual, ‘philosopher’ no less than ‘naturalist’, he had worked from his earliest years on a very broad canvas indeed."
ACA ACA-CTY-001 -0.71 "White Mythologies t If so-called ‘so-called poststructuralism’ is the product of a single historical moment, then that moment is probably not May 1968 but rather the Algerian War of Independence — no doubt itself both a symptom and a product. In this respect it is significant that Sartre, Althusser, Derrida and Lyotard, among others, were all either born in Algeria or personally involved with the events of the war. But let us begin instead with Héléne Cixous's remarkable account of what it was like to grow up as an Algerian French Jewish girl at that time: I learned everything from this first spectacle: I saw how the white (French), superior, plutocratic, civilized world founded its power on the repression of populations who had suddenly become ‘invisible’, like proletarians, immigrant workers, minorities who are not the right ‘colour’. Women. Invisible as humans. But, of course, perceived as tools — dirty, stupid, lazy, underhanded, etc. Thanks to some annihilating dialectical magic. I saw that the great, noble, ‘advanced’ countries established themselves by expelling what was ‘strange’; excluding it but not dismissing it; enslaving it. A commonplace gesture of History: there have to be two races — the masters and the slaves. Cixous has been criticized for lacking a politics and a theory of the social. According to some criteria perhaps, but if so they would have to exclude from ‘the political, considerations such as those described here. Which is precisely the point: if there is a politics to what has become known as poststructuralism, then it is articulated in this passage which unnervingly weaves capitalist economic exploitation, racism, colonialism, sexism, together with, perhaps unexpectedly, ‘History’ and the structure of the Hegelian dialectic. A lot has been said already in the English-speaking world about poststructuralism and politics, much of it in the accusatory mode voiced from the opposing class-based verities of ‘tradition’ or ‘History’. Such apparently secure grounds of objection amount to two narratives; their intriguing similarity brings out the extent to which poststructuralism challenges not  just the politics and institutions of the right but also the politics and theoretical systems of the left. Disturbing conventional assumptions about what constitutes ‘the political’, poststructuralism is correspondingly difficult to place itself. In the passage just cited for example it is striking that Cixous includes the Hegelian dialectic in the forms of political oppression which she describes. It is not a question of showing that such an allegation misinterprets or simplifies Hegel's texts. Of course it does. The problem involves rather the ways in which Hegel has been read, absorbed and adapted. Nor is it just the Hegelian dialectic as such: Cixous includes ‘History’, and by implication therefore Marxism as well. This cannot simply be dismissed as another New Right invocation of the Gulag, for Cixous is arguing something much more specific: that Marxism, insofar as it inherits the system of the Hegelian dialectic, is also implicated in the link between the structures of knowledge and the forms of oppression of the last two hundred years: a phenomenon that has become known as Eurocentrism. To this extent, Marxism's universalizing narrative of the unfolding of a rational system of world history is simply a negative form of the history of European imperialism: it was Hegel, after all, who declared that ‘Africa has no history’, and it was Marx who, though critical of British imperialism, concluded that the British colonization of India was ultimately for the best because it brought India into the evolutionary narrative of Western history, thus creating the conditions for future class struggle there. Such an arrogant and arrogating narrative means that the story of ‘world history’ not only involves what Fredric Jameson describes as the wresting of freedom from the realm of necessity but always also the creation, subjection and final appropriation of Europe's ‘others’. This is why ‘History’, which for Marxism promises liberation, for Cixous also entails another forgotten story of oppression: Already I know all about the ‘reality’ that supports History's progress: everything throughout the centuries depends on the distinction between the Selfsame, the ownself…and that which limits it: so now what menaces my-own-good…is the ‘other’. What is the ‘Other’? If it is truly the ‘other’, there is nothing to say; it cannot be theorized. The ‘other’ escapes me. It is elsewhere, outside: absolutely other. It doesn't settle down. But in History, of course, what is called, other' is an alterity that does settle down, that falls into the dialectical circle. It is the other in a hierarchically organized relationship in which the same is what rules, names, defines, and assigns ‘its’ other. With the dreadful simplicity that orders the movement Hegel erected as a system, society trots along before my eyes reproducing to perfection the mechanism of the death struggle: the reduction of a ‘person, to a ‘nobody’ to the position of ‘other’— the inexorable plot of racism. There has to be some ‘other’— no master  without a slave, no economico-political power without exploitation, no dominant class without cattle under the yoke, no ‘Frenchmen’ without wogs, no Nazis without Jews, no property without exclusion — an exclusion that has its limits and is part of the dialectic. (70–1) Not that Hegel himself is responsible. Rather the problem, Cixous argues, is that unfortunately Hegel wasn't inventing things. The entire Hegelian machinery simply lays down the operation of a system already in place, already operating in everyday life. Politics and knowledge have worked according to the same Hegelian dialectic, with its ‘phallo-logocentric Aufhebung ’— whether it be Marxism's History, Europe's colonial annexations and accompanying racism or orientalist scholarship, or, in a typical conflation of patriarchy and colonialism, Freud's characterization of femininity as the dark unexplored continent (’ within his economy, she is the strangeness he likes to appropriate' [68]). For even Freud, according to Cixous, has not helped in any project to separate history from the history of appropriation or that of phallocentrism. The patriarchal structures of psychoanalytic theory have often been defended on the grounds that they only describe the current customs of a patriarchal society. But this does not alter the fact that psychoanalysis therefore repeats the same masculine ‘Empire of the Selfsame’, and that as soon as such descriptions become institutionalized — as a structure of knowledge, or as psychoanalytic practice — then they become agents of the system they describe. The point is to change it. But why this emphasis on Hegel? The problem of the Hegelian model, particularly of a historicism which presupposes a governing structure of self-realization in all historical process, is by no means confined to post-war French Marxism, but the dominance of Hegelian Marxism from the thirties to the fifties does explain the particular context for the French poststructuralist assault. Here it is not a question of suggesting that Hegel is somehow answerable for the excesses of capitalism or even socialism in the past two hundred years: rather what is at stake is the argument that the dominant force of opposition to capitalism, Marxism, as a body of knowledge itself remains complicit with, and even extends, the system to which it is opposed. Hegel articulates a philosophical structure of the appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge which uncannily simulates the project of nineteenth-century imperialism; the construction of knowledges which all operate through forms of expropriation and incorporation of the other mimics it a conceptual level the geographical and economic absorption of the non-European world by the West. Marxism's standing Hegel on his head may have reversed his idealism, but it did not change the mode of operation of a conceptual system which remains collusively Eurocentric. It is thus entirely appropriate that Hegelian Marxism has become generally known as ‘Western Marxism’. As Cixous suggests, the mode of knowledge as a politics of arrogation  pivots at a theoretical level on the dialectic of the same and the other. Such knowledge is always centred in a self even though it is outward looking, searching for power and control of what is other to it. Anthropology has always provided the clearest symptomatic instance, as was foreseen by Rousseau from the outset. History, with a capital H, similarly cannot tolerate otherness or leave it outside its economy of inclusion. The appropriation of the other as a form of knowledge within a totalizing system can thus be set alongside the history (if not the project) of European imperialism, and the constitution of the other as ‘other’ alongside racism and sexism. The reaction against this structure has produced forms of politics that do not fit into traditional political categories. Here the problem rests on the fact that for orthodox Marxism there can be only one ‘other’, that of the working class, into which all other oppressed groups, so-called ‘minorities’, must in the last instance be subsumed. Such a position is by no means confined to a Marxism of a Stalinist past. In Making History , published in 1987, for example, Alex Callinicos argues that the so-called poststructuralist critique of the category of the subject can be avoided by shifting the subject out of the problematic realm of consciousness into a theory of human agency. This provides something closer to historical Marxism, although it does mean that he quickly becomes involved in assumptions about rationality and intentionality, and has to propose a ‘principle of Humanity’, that is a common human nature, to hold them all together. Perhaps not unexpectedly, the ‘Principle of Humanity’ also turns out to involve the assumption that class is the primary form of collective agency, because, we are told, it is more fundamental than any other interests or forms of social power. Callinicos writes: Feminists and black nationalists [sic]often complain that the concepts of Marxist class theory are ‘gender-blind’ and ‘race-blind’. This is indeed true. Agents' class position derives from their place in production relations, not their gender or supposed race. But of itself this does not provide grounds for rejecting Marxism, since its chief theoretical claim is precisely to explain power-relations and forms of conflict such as those denoted by the terms ‘nation’, ‘gender’ and ‘race’in terms of the forces and relations of production. The mere existence of national, sexual and racial oppression does not refute historical materialism, but rather constitutes its explanandum . The only interesting question is whether or not Marxism can actually explain these phenomena. The only interesting question? So as long as gender and race can be satisfactorily subordinated to class then Marxism does not need refuting, and history can be reasserted as the single narrative of the Third International. Conversely, as Callinicos implicitly recognizes, the problem with  contemporary politics for the left is that the dialectic of class depends on a historicist History and vice versa; any failure of the former necessarily also involves a waning of the latter. Marxism's inability to deal with the political interventions of other oppositional groups has meant that its History can no longer claim to subsume all processes of change. The straightforward oppositional structure of capital and class does not necessarily work any more: if we think in terms of Hegel's master/slave dialectic, then rather than the working class being the obvious universal subject-victim, many others are also oppressed: particularly women, black people, and all other so-called ethnic and minority groups. Any single individual may belong to several of these, but the forms of oppression, as of resistance or change, may not only overlap but may also differ or even conflict. As soon as there is no longer a single master and no single slave, then the classic Hegelian reversal model on which Marxism depends and on which it bases its theory of revolution (literally, an overturning) is no longer adequate. In fact it is arguable whether such dualistic conditions ever existed anyway: marginal groups which could not be assimilated into the category of the working class were merely relegated by Marx to the Lumpenproletariat . Even the formulation of a dualistic class division, Laclau and Mouffe have argued persuasively, is itself nothing less than a nostalgic attempt to recreate for the nineteenth century the imagined simplicity of the conditions of the aristocracy/bourgeoisie conflict of the French Revolution which had originally inspired Hegel. A similarly straightforward opposition also provides much of the attraction which has fuelled the recent growth of interest in the historical analysis of colonialism — in which you apparently have the simple binary of master and slave, colonizer and colonized. With colonialism it's easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys, which makes it tempting to substitute the colonized for the lost working class. Already in 1957 Roland Barthes was claiming that ‘today it is the colonized peoples who assume the full ethical and political condition described by Marx as being that of the proletariat’. But politics today are much more complex, much more difficult to disentangle. The dialectical structure of oppositional politics no longer works for the micro-politics of the post-war period in the West. This is the context of Foucault's critique of what he calls the sovereign model of power, of the idea that power has a single source in a master, king, or class — and can thus easily be reversed. This shift from a conflictual dyadic political structure is not simply a question of historical change, of the recent appearance of ‘minorities’: after all the slave was already constituted simultaneously according to different groups (for example male or female), the Lumpenproletariat always had to be excluded. The problem begins at a conceptual level with the initial division between master and slave as such, as if relations of power work according to the binary opposition of Hegel's fight to the death between two individuals. This structure is not, as might at first be imagined, derived from a fantasy of power relations modelled on a medieval joust but from the phenomenological account of the constitution of knowledge that works according to the structure of a subject perceiving an object, a same/other dialectic in which the other is first constituted by the same through its negation as other before being incorporated within it. No possibility of dialogue or exchange here. As Cixous argues, nor can there be any place in this schema for the other as other, unless it becomes, like God, an absolute other, literally unknowable. The difficulties which arise from this structure are familiar from the debates in feminism, where, woman, seems to be offered an alternative of either being the ‘other’ as constituted by man, that is, conforming to the stereotypes of patriarchy, or, if she is to avoid this, of being an absolute ‘other’outside knowledge, necessarily confined to inarticulate expressions of mysticism or jouissance . The only way to side-step these alternatives seems to be to reject the other altogether and become the same, that is, equal to men — but then with no difference from them. Exactly the same double bind is encountered in any theorization of racial difference. In his influential Le Même et l'autre Vincent Descombes has described the entire history of twentieth-century philosophy in France as a succession of moves which attempt to get out of this Hegelian dialectic: the recent phenomenon of poststructuralism is part of a long philosophical story and distinguished only by what appears to be a certain success, or at least an avoidance of failure to the extent that it has at least managed to keep the game with Hegel in play. The real difficulty has always been to find an alternative to the Hegelian dialectic — difficult because strictly speaking it is impossible, insofar as the operation of the dialectic already includes its negation. You cannot get out of Hegel by simply contradicting him, any more than you can get out of those other Hegelian systems, Marxism and psychoanalysis, by simply opposing them: for in both your opposition is likewise always recuperable, as the workings of ideology or psychic resistance. Nor can you get away from Hegel by simply removing him, like the excision of Trotsky from the side of Lenin in certain official Soviet photographs. This is the lesson of Althusser. Althusser's historical interest derives from the fact that he represents the only orthodox Marxist theorist who has tried to get out of Hegel while remaining a Marxist — though for many Marxists he did sacrifice Marxism in the process, which only suggests how closely Marxism and Hegelianism are intertwined. Althusser's theoretical interest, on the other hand, is that he demonstrates the impossibility of any attempt simply to exclude, excise or extirpate Hegel. Other strategies are required. II HISTORICISM AND IMPERIALISM Metaphysics — the white mythology which reassembles and reflects the culture of the West: the white man takes his own mythology, Indo-European mythology, his own logos , that is, the mythos of his idiom, for the universal form of that he must still wish to call Reason. Jacques Derrida If poststructuralism has involved an attempted disruption or reworking of Hegelianism through the detection of its own fissures, it is not by any means unique in such an enterprise. For, as Foucault argued in 1978, the work of the Frankfurt School could also be regarded as a reassessment of Hegelianism and the metaphysics of dialectical thought. However, it is too simplistic a reaction to suggest that French poststructuralism can therefore be invalidated by judging it against the claims of a comparable endeavour in Germany, a procedure which can only operate by turning the former into a failed version of the latter, which obviously leaves open the possibility of exactly the reverse argument being made. Though the two may have isolated similar problems, the political and intellectual context of their work was by no means the same. The key Frankfurt School text in this regard is obviously Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment of 1944. The date, and the exiled place of composition of its authors, suggests tellingly that the situation with which it attempts to deal is the phenomenon of fascism which seemed to have stopped in its tracks the long march of the progress of reason, and its liberating enlightenment ideals, of which Marxism was the fullest political development. Horkheimer and Adorno therefore pose the question: how has the dialectic deviated into fascism? Why has History gone wrong? Their answer, briefly, was that reason had always contained a measure of irrationality, which, despite its best intentions, had led to its involvement with tyranny and domination: ‘Enlightenment is totalitarian’. The very powers of rationality which enabled modern man to free himself from nature and control it had also become an instrumental device to dominate him. If nature had been modelled by man into productive commodities, man's own subjectivity had also become reified into a self-identical instrument; man had become an empty and passive consumer. The project, therefore, was to return to the enlightenment in the wake of fascism, to excise the forms of instrumental rationality that had produced this self-defeating and, ironically, irrational dialectical structure of domination, and to redefine reason and the forms of identity thinking that had defined the individual simply as an indistinguishable element in the collective. In this way the autonomy and spontaneity of the individual subject that had been the original goal of enlightenment might be retrieved. If for the Frankfurt School the problem to be dealt with was the relation of the phenomena of fascism, and particularly Auschwitz, to the ideals of the enlightenment and the progress of reason, for the French  poststructuralists the historical perspective was similarly long. But it comprised, rather, a history of the West in which fascism was itself merely a symptom, and included not only the history of European imperialism but also the defeats of the European colonial powers by Japan in World War II, the subsequent French (and American) defeat in South-East Asia, the war in Algeria, as well as the many other colonial wars of national liberation. From this point of view the French have never regarded fascism as an aberration, concurring rather with Césaire and Fanon that it can be explained quite simply as European colonialism brought home to Europe by a country that had been deprived of its overseas empire after World War I. French poststructuralism, therefore, involves a critique of reason as a system of domination comparable to that of the Frankfurt School, but rather than setting up the possibility of a purged reason operating in an unblocked, ideal speech situation as a defence against tyranny and coercion in the manner of a Habermas, it reanalyses the operations of reason as such. Here the focus is placed not so much upon the continued presence of irrationality, for irrationality after all is simply reason's own excluded but necessary negative other, but rather on the possibility of other logics being imbricated within reason which might serve to undo its own tendency to domination. Here we have a major difference from the historical pessimism of Adorno's negative dialectics which in certain respects poststructuralism might appear to resemble. Another such project was initiated by Adorno's contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre, whose attempt to define a new form of Hegelian Marxism via a reworked philosophy of consciousness in many ways more closely resembled that of the Frankfurt School. In both cases revisionary work of this kind was embodied in a historical and political analysis of the relation of individual consciousness to society, from within the aegis of an Hegelian Marxism in some respects still impossibly bound to its own enlightenment heritage. This meant that Adorno in particular tended to project science as something exterior and exclusively instrumental; he reacted against it, as well as‘objective’ reason generally, by trying to retrieve the individual subject as the means to salvation. In France, however, there also existed a very different tradition, that of the history of the sciences, a tradition in which Foucault has placed himself. Having been overshadowed since the war by Sartrean Marxism, in the crises of the 1960s it emerged as the more influential of the two. Foucault traces its history back to Husserl's Cartesian Meditations (1929) and the Crisis of the European Sciences (1936)— in which Husserl ‘posed the question of the relations between the ‘Western’ project of a universal deployment of reason,[and]the positivity of the sciences and the radicality of philosophy'. This enabled the establishment of a critical position in relation to science which for Adorno remained so elusive. In larger terms, however, the questions posed in the French tradition were  comparable to those of the Frankfurt School, particularly the interrogation of rationality in its claims to universality. As Foucault puts it: In the history of the sciences in France, as in German critical theory, it is a matter at bottom of examining a reason, the autonomy of whose structures carries with it a history of dogmatism and despotism — a reason, consequently, which can only have an effect of emancipation on condition that it manages to liberate itself from itself. (54) The final emancipatory gesture of enlightenment thought would thus be its own liberation from itself, so that it is no longer recognizable as reason. But what was it that brought about the return of the question of the enlightenment to contemporary philosophical enquiry? Foucault identifies three reasons: first of all the ever-increasing importance of technology, secondly the place of rationalism in the optimism attached to the notion of ‘revolution’— as well as in the despotism that so often followed its realization — and thirdly: the movement which, at the close of the colonial era, led it to be asked of the West what entitles its culture, its science, its social organization, and finally its rationality itself, to be able to claim universal validity: was this not a mirage associated with economic domination and political hegemony? Two centuries later, the Enlightenment returns: but not at all as a way for the West to take cognizance of its present possibilities and of the liberties to which it can have access, but as a way of interrogating it on its limits and on the powers which it has abused. Reason as despotic enlightenment. (54) Foucault's account is particularly useful insofar as it gives a good indication of the characteristic French, as opposed to German, emphasis on the relation of Marxism to enlightenment rationality and the questioning of enlightenment claims to the universality of its values. The first element, the role of science, is common to both, though they approach the question from opposite perspectives. The second, the role of enlightenment thinking in the subsequent history of European despotism, is the particular focus of interest for the German critical theorists, most memorably and most forcibly articulated in Benjamin's ‘Theses on the Philosophy of History’. It is the third element, however, which represents the special interest of the French, whether of the Sartrean or Foucauldian tradition: the relation of the enlightenment, its grand projects and universal truth-claims, to the history of European colonialism. This need not necessarily involve a direct analysis of the effects of colonialism as such, but can also consist of a relentless anatomization of the collusive forms of European knowledge. For Foucault this has comprised a vigorous critique of historicism, including Marxist historicism, and its relation to the operations of knowledge and power. It is from this perspective that it becomes possible to understand the basis of the distrust of totalizing systems of knowledge which depend upon theory and  concepts, so characteristic of Foucault or Lyotard, both of whom have been predominantly concerned with the attempt to isolate and foreground singularity as opposed to universality. This quest for the singular, the contingent event which by definition refuses all conceptualization, can clearly be related to the project of constructing a form of knowledge that respects the other without absorbing it into the same. It is in the work of Edward Said that we can find the problematic of historicist forms of knowledge linked most forcibly to the question of European imperialism. He writes: So far as Orientalism in particular and European knowledge of other societies in general have been concerned, historicism meant that one human history uniting humanity either culminated in or was observed from the vantage point of Europe, or the West… What…has never taken place is an epistemological critique at the most fundamental level of the connection between the development of a historicism which has expanded and developed enough to include antithetical attitudes such as ideologies of Western imperialism and critiques of imperialism on the one hand, and on the other, the actual practice of imperialism by which the accumulation of territories and population, the control of economies, and the incorporation and homogenisation of histories are maintained. This was the difficult project of his own book,Orientalism (1978), which we shall later be examining in detail. For the moment let us focus on Said's subsequent point that if Orientalism and anthropology derive from historicism, this is by no means a thing of the past: of more recent sciences, Said singles out in particular that of world history as practised by Braudel, Wallerstein, Anderson and Wolf, which he contends is still derived from the enterprise of Orientalism and its colluding companion anthropology, and which has refused to encounter and to interrogate its own relationship as a discipline to European imperialism. For Said, the problem amounts simply to historicism and, the universalising and self-validating that has been endemic to it': the theories of accumulation on a world scale, or the capitalist world state, or lineages of absolutism depend (a) on the same displaced percipient and historicist observer who had been an Orientalist or colonial traveller three generations ago;(b) they depend also on a homogenising and incorporating world historical scheme that assimilated non-synchronous developments, histories, cultures, and peoples to it; and (c) they block and keep down latent epistemological critiques of the institutional, cultural and disciplinary instruments linking the incorporative practice of world history with partial knowledges like Orientalism on the one hand, and on the other, with continued ‘Western’ hegemony of the non-European, peripheral world. (22) A new type of knowledge, Said contends, must be produced that can analyse plural objects as such rather than offering forms of integrated understanding that simply comprehend them within totalizing schemas. Already across a wide range of different activities he points to advances in the process of ‘breaking up, dissolving and methodologically as well as critically reconceiving the unitary field ruled hitherto by Orientalism, historicism, and what could be called essentialist universalism’. In this last phrase, Said thus links his critique of Orientalism to other critiques, such as those of racism or of patriarchy. The more difficult question remains of what form this new kind of knowledge can take. Here we return to the theoretical problem of how the other can be articulated as such. How can we represent other cultures? asks Said, as Lévi-Strauss had done before him. His own dismissal of deconstruction as a merely textual practice means that he is himself at a loss when faced with the complex conceptual dialectics of the same and the other. As will be demonstrated with respect to Orientalism itself, Said cannot get out of the Hegelian problematic that he articulates, and indeed tends himself to repeat the very processes that he criticizes. His advocacy of an analytic pluralism in itself does not solve, or even address, the conceptual problems. Nevertheless, Said's comments suggest the wider significance of his project. The demise of an orthodox Marxism may have left theory with a sense that everything is now in flux, that the old verities have gone, but it has also involved the important realization, articulated so forcibly by writers such as Foucault or Said, of the deep articulation of knowledge with power. The politics of poststructuralism forces the recognition that all knowledge may be variously contaminated, implicated in its very formal or ‘objective, structures. This means that in particular colonial discourse analysis is not merely a marginal adjunct to more mainstream studies, a specialized activity only for minorities or for historians of imperialism and colonialism, but itself forms the point of questioning of Western knowledge's categories and assumptions. In the same way, Fanon suggests that at the political level the so-called ‘Third World’ constitutes the disruptive term for the European political dialectic of capitalism and socialism. Everyone feels the need nowadays to qualify the term ‘Third World’, stating quite correctly that it should not be taken to imply a homogeneous entity. The inadequateness of the term, however, insofar as it offers a univocal description of an extremely heterogeneous section of the world, also means that a suitable alternative general category cannot by definition be produced. In this situation, abject apologies in some respects remain complicit with the patronizing attitudes from which they attempt to disassociate themselves. For the ‘Third World’ was invented in the context of the 1955 Bandung Conference, on the model of the French Revolution's ‘Third Estate’, and incorporating equally revolutionary ideals of providing a radical alternative to the hegemonic capitalist-socialist power  blocks of the post-war period. The Third World as a term needs to retrieve this lost positive sense — even if today the political order has changed so that to some extent the various forms of Islamic fundamentalism have taken over the role of providing a direct alternative to First and Second World ideologies. ‘Third World’ will, therefore, be used in this book without (further) apology, or scare quotes, as a positive term of radical critique even if it also necessarily signals its negative sense of economic dependency and exploitation. III THE PHILOSOPHICAL ALLERGY Although Said rejects them, and Foucault characteristically does not mention them, the most effective ploys that have recently been played in this project of articulating another form of knowledge, of redefining the basis of knowledge as such, derive from a different although related body of work to that which Foucault describes — namely the phenomenological tradition of Heidegger, Levinas, and Derrida, which, seemingly like all twentieth-century European philosophy, also traces its apparent origins back to Husserl. As we have seen, the fundamental problem concerns the way in which knowledge — and therefore theory, or history — is constituted through the comprehension and incorporation of the other. This has led to a series of attempts to reinscribe a place for, and a relation with, the other as other, outside the sphere of mastery and therefore, logically speaking, both infinite and beyond the scope of knowledge. Emmanuel Levinas, for example, whose career has been long enough to have introduced Husserl to Sartre in the thirties and to have been able to reply to Derrida in the seventies, proposes a rather different critique of such models of knowledge to those which we have encountered so far. According to Levinas, Western philosophy coincides with the disclosure of the other where the other, in manifesting itself as a being, loses its alterity. From its infancy philosophy has been struck with a horror of the other that remains other — with an insurmountable allergy… Hegel's philosophy represents the logical outcome of this underlying allergy of philosophy. Levinas objects to the implicit violence in the process of knowledge which appropriates and sublates the essence of the other into itself. But as we can see, he does not just blame Hegel here, for according to Levinas ontology itself is the problem. Concerned to find a way to allow the other to remain as other, Levinas therefore rejects not only Hegel but Husserl, Heidegger and Sartre also, and abjures ontology altogether. Because ontology involves an ethico-political violence towards the other, always to some degree seen as a threat, Levinas proposes ethics in its place, substituting a respect for the other for a grasping of it, and a theory of desire not as negation and assimilation but as infinite separation. In Totality and Infinity (1961), a book self-consciously written under the shadow of two ‘world’ wars in which Europe, at the limit of its attempt to devour the world, turned in on itself in two violent acts of self-consummation, Levinas questions the accepted relation between morality and politics. It must always, he suggests, be possible to criticize politics from the point of view of the ethical. As Althusser was keen to emphasize, according to Marx morality works simply as a form of ideological control, and Levinas concurs that ‘everyone will readily agree that it is the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality’(21). But, he argues, the placing of politics —‘the art of foreseeing war and of winning it by every means’— before morality overlooks the extent to which war constitutes the philosophical concept of being itself. For being is always defined as the appropriation of either difference into identity, or of identities into a greater order, be it absolute knowledge, History, or the state. For its part, violence involves not just physical force, injuring or annihilating persons, but also interrupting their continuity, making them play roles in which they no longer recognize themselves, making them betray not only commitments but their own substance… Not only modern war but every war employs arms that turn against those who wield them. It establishes an order from which no one can keep his distance; nothing henceforth is exterior. (21) War, then, is another form of the appropriation of the other, and underpins all ontological thinking with its violence. Its corollary, or ‘visage’, is the concept of totality, which, as Levinas observes, has dominated Western philosophy in its long history of desire for Unity and the One. Through the totality, itself a kind of rational self writ large, the individual takes on meaning; the present is sacrificed to a future which will bring forth an ultimate, objective meaning when the totality of history is realized. The objection therefore to totalization is not founded on any simple analogy with totalitarianism — though neither can this be excluded — but rather on the implicit violence of ontology itself, in which the same constitutes itself through a form of negativity in relation to the other, producing all knowledge by appropriating and sublating the other within itself. As Levinas puts it, ‘the idea of truth as a grasp on things must necessarily have a non-metaphorical sense somewhere’. In Western philosophy, when knowledge or theory comprehends the other, then the alterity of the latter vanishes as it becomes part of the same. This ‘ontological imperialism’, Levinas argues, goes back at least to Socrates but can be found as recently as Heidegger. In all cases the other is neutralized as a means of encompassing it: ontology amounts to a philosophy of power, an egotism in which the relation with the other is accomplished through its assimilation into the self. Its political implications are clear enough: Heidegger, with the whole of Western history, takes the relation with the Other as enacted in the destiny of sedentary peoples, the possessors and builders of the earth. Possession is preeminently the form in which the other becomes the same, by becoming mine. (46) Ontology, therefore, though outwardly directed, remains always centred in an incorporating self: ‘this imperialism of the same’, Levinas suggests, ‘is the whole essence of freedom’(87). For freedom is maintained by a self-possession which extends itself to anything that threatens its identity. In this structure European philosophy reduplicates Western foreign policy, where democracy at home is maintained through colonial or neocolonial oppression abroad. Levinas opposes freedom, based on self-interest, to justice, which respects the alterity of the other and can only be proposed through the asymmetry of dialogue. This also implies an interrogation of the imperialism of theory itself. For theory, as a form of knowledge and understanding of the spectator, is constitutively unable to let the other remain outside itself, outside its representation of the panorama which it surveys, in a state of singularity or separation. This will also be true of any concept, because by definition the concept ‘cannot capture the absolutely-other’; and, to the extent that it must invoke a form of generality, of language itself. Any conventional form of understanding must appropriate the other, in an act of violence and reduction. This leads Levinas to denounce the inability of theory, in its drive to comprehension and representation, to do justice to any radical exteriority. But how can we know and respect the other? Is there a means of bridging the gap between knowledge and morality that avoids the problems of Kant's recourse to the aesthetic but also resists Lyotard's argument that the two are simply incommensurable? How can Levinas' ethics work differently from ontology? Against the egotism of the preoccupation of being with itself, he posits a relation of sociality, whereby the self instead of assimilating the other opens itself to it through a relation with it. In the place of the correlation of knowledge with vision and light, the visual metaphor by which the adequation of the idea with the thing has been thought from Plato to Heidegger, Levinas proposes language, which in the form of speech enables a kind of invisible contact between subjects that leaves them both intact. Language, however, should take the form of dialogue: whereas the universality of reason means that it must necessarily renounce all singularity, and whereas language's function in conceptualizing thought is to suppress the other and bring it within the aegis of the same, in dialogue language maintains the distance between the two; ‘their commerce’, as Levinas puts it, ‘is ethical’. Dialogism allows for ‘radical separation, the strangeness of the interlocutors, the revelation of the other to me’(73). The structure of dialogue, moreover, disallows the taking up of any position beyond the  interlocutors from which they can be integrated into a larger totality. The relation between them, therefore, is not oppositional, nor limitrophe, but one of alterity. Dialogue, face to face conversation, maintains a non-symmetrical relation, a separation through speech. In so doing it breaches any totality, including History: To say that the other can remain absolutely other, that he enters only into the relationship of conversation, is to say that history itself, an identification of the same, cannot claim to totalise the same and the other. The absolutely other, whose alterity is overcome in the philosophy of immanence on the allegedly common plane of history, maintains his transcendence in the midst of history. The same is essentially identification within the diverse, or history, or system. It is not I who resist the system, as Kierkegaard thought; it is the other. (40) The thesis of the primacy of History, Levinas argues, forms part of the imperialism of the same. For ‘totalization is accomplished only in history, when the historiographer assimilates all particular existences and punctual moments into the time of universal history, whose chronological order, it is assumed, ‘outlines the plot of being in itself, analogous to nature’(55). If History claims to incorporate the other within a larger impersonal spirit or idea, albeit the ruse of reason, Levinas contends that ‘this alleged integration is cruelty and injustice, that is,[it]ignores the Other’(52). History is the realm of violence and war; it constitutes another form by which the other is appropriated into the same. For the other to remain other it must not derive its meaning from History but must instead have a separate time which differs from historical time. Whereas for Heidegger time and history are the horizon of Being, for Levinas ‘when man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history’(52). Time itself involves the ‘relationship to unattainable alterity’, an absolute past. It is in temporality, in anteriority, that we find an otherness beyond being. Levinas calls the relation in which an infinite distance is maintained from the other ‘metaphysics’. Metaphysics, he writes, ‘transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same, of the Other by me, is concretely produced as the calling into question of the same by the other, that is, as the ethics that accomplishes the critical essence of knowledge’(43). Metaphysics therefore precedes ontology. Though a troubling term, metaphysics for Levinas names a counter-tradition in philosophy in which the idea of infinity breaches all totality because ‘it is a relationship with a surplus always exterior to the totality ’(22). This surplus is the effect of the radical alterity of the other, whether as ‘face’ or as death, which prevents the totality from being constituted as such. As might be expected, it is the possibility of this absolute otherness, and the ability to excise all violence in the relation with it, which Derrida questions in the first of his discussions of Levinas. Whereas Levinas, like Habermas, posits an authentic language of expression which abhors the distortions of ‘rhetoric’, Derrida argues that such alterity is constituted not through dialogue but rather through the operation of language itself: Levinas' transcendence-as-surplus is therefore redefined as a Derridean supplement. This would mean that there can never be an authentic speech of the other as such, a position which certainly troubles Levinas' fundamental argument. Despite their differences, Derrida's keen interest in Levinas, as Christopher Norris has argued in scrupulously non-Derridean terms, points to ‘the ultimately ethical nature of his enterprise’. The early essay on Levinas, dating from 1964, shows the extent to which Derrida has been implicated in such questions from the first — though,contra Norris, he has always shown that the conditions of ‘writing’ that make ethics possible also makes them impossible. Certain orientations of his work can be affiliated to Levinas' attempt to shift the relation to alterity from an appropriation by the same into its totality to a respect for the other's heterogeneity. Derrida has even described the critique of logocentrism as ‘above all else the search for the ‘other’’. This can be related to the concern in Derrida's work with the politics of feminism and other positions which contest institutional and political appropriation and exclusion. In recent years Levinas has himself articulated more explicitly his account of the relation of the ethical to the political. If there were just two, as in the face-to-face dialogue, then the ethical would preside as the injunction of responsibility for the other. But as soon as there are three, he suggests, then the ethical moves into politics. ‘We can never’, Levinas concedes to Derrida, ‘completely escape from the language of ontology and politics’. But this does not mean that the ethical has to renounce the moral order in the political world of the third person — of justice, of government, institutions, or the law. The political can retain an ethical foundation: Levinas finds his example for this, unexpectedly, in Marx's famous comment on idealist philosophers — that the point is not to describe the world but to change it: In Marx's critique we find an ethical conscience cutting through the ontological identification of truth with an ideal intelligibility and demanding that theory be converted into a concrete praxis of concern for the other. From this perspective Levinas proposes the possibility that the much lamented ‘subject’ be brought back not as the ontological subject which seeks to reduce everything to itself but as an ethical subject defined in relation to the other: ‘Ethics redefines subjectivity as this heteronomous responsibility in contrast to autonomous freedom’. We might compare this ethical relation to Cixous' remarks about the need to love the other or Kristeva's recent preoccupation with love which, from this perspective, hardly involves the sudden apostasy of which she has been  accused, but rather as for Levinas consists of a way of formulating a ‘responsibility for the Other, being-for-the-other’. In each case these writers can be shown to be trying to place the other outside the sphere of mastery rather than in a relation of negation or of reduplication of the self. Unlike a conventional ethics of altruism, such a relation remains one of alterity. There will always be some return for the self in any gift — unless it can be articulated in an economy of ingratitude, a movement without return. Unless, that is, philosophy can become dissemination: ‘a work conceived radically is a movement of the same unto the other which never returns to the same ’. To the story of Ulysses, Levinas opposes that of Abraham who leaves his fatherland for ever, never to return. This figure of the diaspora returns us to one of the most important aspects of Levinas' formulation of the relation of the ethical to the political, that is the connections which he makes between the structure of ontology and Eurocentrism, the latter ‘disqualified’, as he puts it, ‘by so many horrors’. He connects the form of knowledge that is self-centred but directed outwards, philosophy as ‘egology’, quite explicitly with the appropriating narcissism of the West. So in the past few hundred years Europe has been, as Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has suggested, constituted and consolidated as ‘sovereign subject, indeed sovereign and subject’. Just as the colonized has been constructed according to the terms of the colonizer's own self-image, as the ‘self-consolidating other’, so Europe consolidated itself as sovereign subject by defining its colonies as ‘Others’, even as it constituted them, for purposes of administration and the expansion of markets, into programmed near-images of that very sovereign self. It is this sovereign self of Europe which is today being deconstructed, showing the extent to which Europe's other has been a narcissistic self-image through which it has constituted itself while never allowing it to achieve a perfect fit. This can be allied to Derrida's critique of ‘a certain fundamental Europeanization of world culture’. Derrida has sometimes been criticized for the generality of phrases such as‘the history of the West’ or the claim that his work involves a critique of ‘Western metaphysics’. Although one of the earliest questions put to him in England concerned this category of ‘the West’, in the subsequent fervour that accompanied the transformation of Derrida's work into the method of deconstruction, this problem tended to slip out of view. In its largest and perhaps most significant perspective, deconstruction involves not just a critique of the grounds of knowledge in general, but specifically of the grounds of Occidental knowledge. The equation of knowledge with ‘what is called Western thought, the thought whose destiny is to extend its domains while the boundaries of the West are drawn back’ involves the very kind of assumption that Derrida is interrogating — and this is the reason for his  constant emphasis on its being the knowledge of the West; in the same way Foucault also emphasizes that he is specifically discussing the ‘Western episteme ’. The assertion that Derrida's work incurs a form of relativism is thus exactly to the point, though its implications are rather different from those generally assumed in such a complaint. For we can say that deconstruction involves the decentralization and decolonization of European thought — insofar as it is ‘incapable of respecting the Being and meaning of the other’, and to the extent that its philosophical tradition makes ‘common cause with oppression and with the totalitarianism of the same’. This has been the significance of Levinas' thought for Derrida. As he puts it in Writing and Difference , at the very moment when the fundamental conceptual systems of Europe are in the process of taking over all of humanity, Levinas leads us instead to ‘an inconceivable process of dismantling and dispossession’. For Levinas' thought seeks to liberate itself from the Greek domination of the Same and the One…as if from oppression itself — an oppression certainly comparable to none other in the world, an ontological or transcendental oppression, but also the origin or alibi of all oppression in the world. This is the context in which to set Derrida's own intervention in Of Grammatology . Everyone knows that that book is a critique of ‘logocentrism’; what is less often recalled is that the terms of the critique with which it opens announce the design of focusing attention on logocentrism's ethnocentrism ’ which, Derrida suggests, is ‘nothing but the most original and powerful ethnocentrism, in the process of imposing itself upon the world’. It is this preoccupation which accounts for Derrida's choice, and forceful interrogation, of the privileged examples of Saussure — where he focuses on the ‘profound ethnocentrism’ of his exclusion of writing — Rousseau and Lévi-Strauss. In the case of the latter, Derrida's interest also focuses particularly on the way in which Lévi-Strauss produces his knowledge of a non-European civilization according to a doubled but non-contradictory logic which evades identity-thinking. The well-known deconstruction carried out in ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’ shows how the constitution of anthropological knowledge, though often paraded as scientific and objective, is nevertheless governed by a problematic of which it remains unaware: the philosophical category of the centre — which Derrida then proceeds to articulate with the problem of Eurocentrism. The analysis of the dialectics of the centre and the margin can thus operate geographically as well as conceptually, articulating the power relationships between the metropolitan and the colonial cultures at their geographical peripheries. This is not to suggest, however, that deconstruction in any sense brings another knowledge to bear: rather it involves a critique of Western knowledge that works by exploiting the ambivalent resources of Western writing, as if Marxism were to produce a critique of ideology without the advantage of its  science (which, given the current ambiguous status of Marxist science is not a possibility to be dismissed lightly). If one had to answer, therefore, the general question of what is deconstruction a deconstruction of, the answer would be, of the concept, the authority, and assumed primacy of, the category of ‘the West’. If deconstruction forms part of a more widespread attempt to decolonize the forms of European thought, from this perspective Derrida's work can be understood as characteristically postmodern. postmodernism can best be defined as European culture's awareness that it is no longer the unquestioned and dominant centre of the world. Significantly enough one of the very earliest uses of the term ‘postmodern’, dating from the time of the Second World War, was that of Arnold Toynbee in his A Study of History . He used it to describe the new age of Western history which, according to Toynbee, began in the 1870s with the simultaneous globalization of Western culture and the re-empowerment of non-Western states. If this new period brought with it a phase of Spenglerian pessimism after the long years of Victorian optimism, Toynbee did not himself assume that the West was in decline as such, but rather that paradoxically the globalization of Western civilization was being accompanied by a self-consciousness of its own cultural relativization, a process to which Toynbee's own equally totalizing and relativizing history was designed to contribute. Reviewing the genesis of his whole project, he recounts that his history was written against a current Late Modern Western convention of identifying a parvenu and provincial Western Society's history with ‘History’, writ large,sans phrase . In the writer's view this convention was the preposterous off-spring of a distorting egocentric illusion to which the children of a Western Civilisation had succumbed like the children of all other known civilisations and known primitive societies. Postmodernism, therefore, becomes a certain self-consciousness about a culture's own historical relativity — which begins to explain why, as its critics complain, it also involves the loss of the sense of an absoluteness of any Western account of History. Today, if we pose the difficult question of the relation of poststructuralism to postmodernism, one distinction between them that might be drawn would be that whereas postmodernism seems to include the problematic of the place of Western culture in relation to non-Western cultures, poststructuralism as a category seems not to imply such a perspective. This, however, is hardly the case, for it rather involves if anything a more active critique of the Eurocentric premises of Western knowledge. The difference would be that it does not offer a critique by positioning itself outside ‘the West’, but rather uses its own alterity and duplicity in order to effect its deconstruction. In this context, we may note, attempts to account for poststructuralism in terms of the aftermath of the events of May 68 seem positively myopic, lacking the very historical  perspective to which they lay claim. Contrary, then, to some of its more overreaching definitions, postmodernism itself could be said to mark not just the cultural effects of a new stage of ‘late’ capitalism, but the sense of the loss of European history and culture as History and Culture, the loss of their unquestioned place at the centre of the world. We could say that if, according to Foucault, the centrality of ‘Man’ dissolved at the end of the eighteenth century as the ‘Classical Order’gave way to ‘History’, today at the end of the twentieth century, as ‘History’gives way to the ‘Postmodern’, we are witnessing the dissolution of ‘the West’."
ACA ACA-CTY-003 -0.11 "Sartre's extravagances Thus, the world and man reveal themselves by undertakings . And all the undertakings we might speak of reduce themselves to a single one, that of making history . Jean-Paul Sartre Sartre took the opposite course to Merleau-Ponty and sought instead to define a new authentic Marxism. His project in the Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960) amounted to a philosophical defence of Marxism and its dialectic through a reassertion of its claim to be the only valid interpretation of history, ‘the untranscendable philosophy for our time’. However, Sartre was no more prepared than Merleau-ponty to return to what he characterized as Marxist organicism, in which the laws of history unfold according to their own autonomous momentum. Not wishing to propose History as a transcendent law outside the human, Sartre was careful to distinguish his claims from Engels' validation of the dialectic as the law of nature. He sought instead to prove that history achieves its course and its meaning from the actions of men, even if men are also simultaneously the products of history. Merleau-ponty had accused the existentialist Sartre of denying history and trying to hold everything together instead ‘only by the hopeless heroism of the I’. Sartre therefore tried to show that the two were not opposed: arguing that the dialectic is produced by human subjectivity rather than inscribed within history itself, at the same time he also asserted the truth of the Marxist account of there being one history with a single meaning — a history, that is, in which all differences return as the same. Everything, therefore, hinged on Sartre's ability to substantiate the inter-dependence of these two claims. ‘There is a crisis in Marxism’, Sartre announced at the beginning of the Critique ; this crisis, not the first and not to be the last, Sartre characterized as the result of a paradox in which historical materialism had become ‘at one and the same time, the only truth of History and a total indetermination of the Truth’(I, 19). Today we might say that it had been shown to be different from itself. This was the aporia detected by Merleau-Ponty: but rather than question Marxism's truth, Sartre sought to remove its indetermination. He  argued that though historical materialism had satisfactorily explained the forms and conditions of human reality it had never established theoretically the validity of its own existence, never shown how it constituted not just the substance of reality but its logical form as well. In order to prove the truth of History's prospective totalization into one meaning, therefore, Sartre's initial philosophical task was to ground his argument epistemologically by proving the legitimacy of the dialectic itself, thus demonstrating not only that history was dialectically intelligible but also why it necessarily should be so. ‘The dialectic’, according to Sartre, ‘is both a method and a movement in the object’(I, 20): Marxism asserts simultaneously that both the process of knowledge and the structure of the real are dialectical, but it has never proved the former — basing its claim to truth instead on the ‘dogmatic dialectic, of natural science. Accordingly, much of Volume I of the Critique is taken up with the attempt to prove the dialectic a priori as the universal method and the law of anthropology, superseding that which Kant had provided for analytical reason. Volume Two, Sartre announces, will then prove ‘the Truth of History ’(I, 52): it will attempt to establish that there is one human history, with one truth and one intelligibility — not by considering the material content of this history, but by demonstrating that a practical multiplicity, whatever it may be, must unceasingly totalise itself through interiorizing its multiplicity at all levels. (I, 69) The point, therefore, is to validate Marxism, to show that it is not simply a method of interpretation, nor even that it is the best method of interpretation that can most successfully account for the facts and the course of history, but to prove a priori that history works according to dialectical structures, and to demonstrate ‘the moments of their inter-relations, the ever vaster and more complex movement which totalises them and, finally, the very direction of the totalization, that is to say, the ‘meaning of History’ and its Truth,(I, 69). Had he succeeded, Sartre would have established dialectical reason as successfully for the human sciences as Kant had established analytical reason for natural science. But he was unable to do it. The indetermination that he sought to banish increasingly returned to haunt him; he could never demonstrate how the unceasing totalization of multiplicity would ever reach its promised moment of finality. Sartre's claim for the continued validity of Marxism as a method of understanding necessarily meant that he had to respond to the problem of Stalinism. His was the first attempt to explain Stalinism as an aberration through the forms of Marxist analysis itself. Rather than reject Marxism on the grounds that it had been disproved by history, as Merleau-ponty had done, he sought to account for Stalinism through a dialectical analysis of the specific history of the Soviet Union since the Revolution: theory and practice, he argued, had become separated with the result that the former  had become ‘sclerosed’ while the latter had become ‘blind’and ‘unprincipled’(I, 50). According to Sartre, if the dialectic had become blocked, an understanding of its detour could nevertheless only be achieved through the use of a dialectical logic. He therefore sought to prove both that the structures of history were necessarily dialectical and that the course of actual history could be shown to be so. But in attempting to discover why the Russian Revolution followed the path it did, he found himself arriving at the conclusion that, far from being a ‘false’ deviation, in the circumstances of history Stalinism had been necessary. Having set out to demonstrate how, through its understanding of the structure of history, Marxism was in a position to forecast the future, he came to the conclusion that there was no guarantee that history could promise anything better that what had just passed. II THE FIRST CRITIQUE  Unity had been easy during the Resistance, because relationships were almost always man-to-man. Over against the German army or the Vichy government, where social generality ruled, as it does in all machines of state, the Resistance offered the rare phenomenon of historical action which remained personal. The psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here, which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the Resistance. The Resistance was a unique experience for them, and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing, which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action…. It is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it. And in this sense it must be said that the Resistance experience, by making us believe that politics is a relationship between man and man or between consciousnesses, fostered our illusions of 1939 and masked the truth of the incredible power of history which the Occupation taught us in another connection. If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre's project in the Critique , the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre's earlier work, that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom: how to relocate human practice within historical determinism, to reconcile the individual with the social, the idea of agency with that of necessity, or freedom with history? For Marxist or Hegelian thought, such an age-old contradiction ought to be resolvable through the operations of dialectical logic. Citing Marx's famous remark in  The Eighteenth Brumaire , ‘Men make their own History…but under circumstances…given and transmitted from the past’, Sartre suggested that this implied ‘the permanent and dialectical unity of freedom and necessity,(I, 35). Accordingly, he attempted to shift Marxism away from orthodox theories of an absolute determinism towards the primacy of a concept of ‘History’ which, while still a totality as it had been for Lukács, a process with a determinate meaning and end, could also include a concept of human agency and thus articulate the individual with the social, freedom with determinism. Today, Sartre's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject, which goes together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing systems of Adorno, Althusser or Foucault. Sartre's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle, have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative, the subject, almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself. But it still leaves us with the crucial problem that Sartre had to solve, namely how to link human consciousness with the processes of history so that the former can be said to be the agent of the latter. How could this take place? As Sartre had put it in What is Literature ?: ‘Never has homo faber better understood that he has made history and never has he felt so powerless before history’. How can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him? Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second, making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances. Unwilling to follow Merleau-Ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first, Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis , that is intentional actions which produce material effects. Its corollary, whereby praxis becomes determining history, he called the ‘practico-inert’, by which he meant the material circumstances that have themselves been created by previous praxes and which form the conditions for new praxis. The individual is thus both totalizer and totalized, deftly uniting freedom with necessity. Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him, it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts, ‘totalizations’, can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary, blind and self-cancelling movements of, say, Hardy's immanent will. Sartre's fundamental thesis, that ‘History continually effects totalisations of totalisations’(I, 15), does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre: ‘how do separate, antagonistic actions yield a history; how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization (and also progress, the direction of history, its truth and its meaning)?’ For the whole basis of Sartre's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law, ‘some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God’, but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader, developing totalization (I, 37). What Sartre needs to demonstrate, therefore, is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level, overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such: The dialectic is the law of totalization which creates several collectivities,several societies, and one history — realities, that is, which impose themselves on individuals; but at the same time it must be woven out of millions of individual actions. We must show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant …and a totalizing force …how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration. (I, 36) But what produces the overall direction of History? How does it ‘continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration’? Sartre does not attempt to answer this question, shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness. The dialectic is the law that remains hidden. At the moment, ‘history is made without being known (l'histoire se fait sans se connâitre)’—history constitutes, we might say today, a political unconscious. ‘Marxism’, on the other hand, Sartre claims, ‘is History itself becoming conscious of itself’(I, 40): as for Lukács, it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history's meaning — and so recognize itself as the meaning of history. While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place, and that civil, foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle, Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses. The ‘detour, of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism's own descent into its unconscious, resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism's own reading of history. It is therefore, Sartre argues, our historical task to make it known, promoting not just the historical process as such, but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history, with one meaning — the ‘Truth of humanity’(I, 822). Sartre's account thus sets up the articulation of history, univocal meaning, and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism, necessary in order to save it from its detour  from itself. The problem, however, remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes. If History is a history of conflict, how could it be both one and internally diversified without the inner moving principle of the dialectic? How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual, if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed by the other? If each action negates the aim of the other, where is the ‘unity’ totalized in the conflict? How does History constantly totalize itself? (I, 817 — 18) Sartre arrives at what he calls ‘the real problem of History’, that is how there can be totalization without a totalizer, only at the very end of Volume I. It is not until the next volume, however, that he intends to show how individual actions, separate multiplicities, make up ‘one human history, with one truth and one intelligibility’(I, 69). Throughout, Sartre has nevertheless taken it ‘for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth’(I, 822). His History, therefore, is always in process: but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed. He thus asserts the Truth of History while constantly projecting forwards and deferring its proof. But when the proof comes it also turns out to rest on the assumption that it is already true. III THE SECOND CRITIQUE : ‘We are trying to establish the Truth of History'  Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved. He asserts it often enough: ‘History continually effects totalisations of totalisations,(I, 15). But in Volume I of the Critique , as we have seen, he continually defers the demonstration of his proof. For the ‘dogmatic dialectic’, as he describes dialectical materialism, the whole question naturally poses no problem, for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them. But Sartre's dispensing with all historicist schemas creates the problem of how, between two autonomous and contradictory totalizations, there could be ‘one dialectical intelligibility of the ongoing process’(II, 13). He attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour: ‘anti-labour’(anti-travail ), a category of negation. The products of a conflict, as well as its residues, may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants. Nevertheless they constitute the basis and conditions for further actions and history. Dialectical reason encounters such products as undecidables: aporias — because they seem to be at once the results of a communal enterprise while at the same time bearing witness to the fact that this enterprise never existed except as the inhuman reverse side of two opposed actions in which each aims to destroy the other. In the dialectical perspective, we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future…thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process. (II, 20) This means that first, they lead to unforeseeable results, and second, that the internal structure of social objects contains ‘the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other’(II, 22). There is, therefore, before any understanding of historic agents and movements, a certain aporia in all social ensembles: from afar they may appear whole, but close to, they can be seen as riddled with holes. This increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre's own account of History. In the context of the negativity of this formulation, Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization, without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic, or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that, as for Adorno or Bakhtin, history does not develop positively but, rather, negatively, and is therefore instead detotalizing: Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories, or if, in any case, within the relationship of immanence that characterizes struggle, the negation of each adversary by the other is on principle detotalizing . Certainly, we have neither the design nor the actual possibility of showing here the full truth of dialectical materialism… Our goal is solely to establish whether, in a practical ensemble torn apart by antagonism (whether there are multiple conflicts or whether they are reduced to one) the breaks themselves are totalizing and carried along by the totalizing movement of the ensemble. (II, 25) At this point Sartre confronts the possibility that the whole project of the Critique , stated so confidently on its very first page —‘it must be proved that a negation of a negation can be an affirmation’(I, 15)— may break down. perhaps the Truth of History cannot be proved; its direction cannot be discerned. Sartre's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category, a unifying force of a ‘singularization’ which incarnates the universal: ‘If totalization really is an ongoing process’, he writes, ‘then it operates everywhere. That means both that there is a dialectical meaning of the practical ensemble…and that each singular event totalizes in itself the practical ensemble in the infinite richness of its singularity’(II, 26). Unlike Lukács' insignificant event from which the  universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative, Sartre's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal, the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while, as he puts it, ‘the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny’. Sartre's ‘singular universal’, therefore, begs the question, for it is predicated on the assumption that, if there is not a totality as such, then there already is an overall totalization: ‘If totalization really is an ongoing process…’. That developing process is itself totalized through Sartre's assertion that each totalization is the totalization of all struggles, as it must be if the singular is to incarnate the universal. The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing. So the singular universal presumes the totalization he can't (yet) prove. This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre's text: each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer, he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident, but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again. In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works, by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match — a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic. Its totalization takes place through its incarnation, as part of the totality of boxing, in the overall framework within which each individual fight occurs. Each boxing match, Sartre claims, must be both a unique event and also in some sense the incarnation of all boxing, whose rules and conventions it follows, and whose past and future history it sets itself against. But it is also apparent that that totality is not completely known, nor is its future shape even presumed. By totalization, therefore, Sartre does not here mean anything like a predetermined end or final closure of a totality but rather a process of mediation among the parts, where each is determined by the other. No one can predict the future of boxing, either at the level of particular victories or defeats, in effect a structure of repetition, nor at the more general level of possible modifications or developments of the sport. Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing, known and unknown. This allows Sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme. Since it cannot be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future, Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment: ‘The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes’(II, 58). The universal, the totality, can only be known through the singular. But its future direction remains unknown and indeterminate. At the same time Sartre makes a larger, though less persuasive claim that  the boxing-match also works synecdochally and re-exteriorizes a more fundamental violence, namely the interiorized condition of scarcity that he considers to be the basis of conflict in general. The boxing match ‘is the public incarnation of all conflict’(II, 32), totalizing in its own struggle the whole of ‘contemporary irreducibilities and fissures’(II, 26): thus one can and must say…that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation, it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is. (II, 58) But then he adds, ‘I have said and I repeat that we have not yet proved that this enveloping totalization exists’. So, although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality, insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination, unlike the case of the boxing match, where we can define the overall entity ‘boxing’, it still remains unproven that an overall entity, ‘History’, can be said to exist at all. For all his use of the model of the boxing match, Sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer. It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of ‘boxing’, which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation, for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition. But what about those conflicts that do not take place within such a constituted social system, such as conflictual bourgeois societies which cannot be said to be unified, except, as Sartre suggests dismissively, by appeal to a lost paradise before the class struggle? Such societies make the conflicts of history irreducible to Sartre's logic unless, like the boxing match, they can be shown to take part in a larger totalizable category. However, when he poses the question of whether his method could work as well for the class struggle as for the boxing match, Sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups. Once again he backtracks and assumes a larger unity in which conflict takes place. The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique : every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer, he turns back to a previous, more easily intelligible stage on the way. His difficulty is accompanied by a no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that, in championing specificities against them, he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals — History as Totalization — that originally formed the object of his project. At this point a further contradiction in Sartre's whole enterprise begins to open up: for someone so deeply distrustful of universals it seems curious that he has involved himself so emphatically with the notions of totality, History, and  the dialectic. As Sartre insists more and more upon the virtues of specificity (II, 200 — 05), such is his distaste for Marxist or any other universalizing categories that he refuses even to countenance them, attempting to replace concepts with specificities, universals with singulars. His scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of ‘society’ or ‘the nation’as such (II, 24, 61)— the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires. Here certain similarities with later ‘post-Marxist’ theorists such as Foucault or Lyotard, begin to become apparent. But if Sartre anticipates such later thinkers we should not assume too quickly that they have simply taken his insights further. For Sartre's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to History insofar as it simply renames, in one oxymoronic category, the original antithetical terms. Without an adequate theory of their articulation, they simply begin to separate again. IV THE AMBIVALENCE OF HISTORY The ‘singular universal’, with its organicist and essentialist overtones whereby the part incarnates the whole, is thus the product of Sartre's hesitation between the singular, which remains privileged as the existential basis of history, and the universal which as a Marxist he feels is required for its intelligibility and validation. The effect of Sartre's oscillation between these two poles is that his argument is increasingly drawn towards the very positions that ostensibly he wishes to refute. So, for example, he compulsively returns to the idea that history might consist of several totalizations rather than one: Might not History, at the level of the grand ensembles, be an ambiguous interpenetration of unity and plurality, of dialectic and anti-dialectic, of sense and nonsense? Might there not be, according to the circumstances and the particular ensemble,several totalizations without any links between them except coexistence or no matter what other exterior link? (II, 131) Up to this point, Sartre's notion of conflict has operated in direct antithesis to that of Bakhtin: whereas for Sartre, struggles are totalizing, always creating a larger, meaningful and developing whole out of multiplicities, for Bakhtin they are detotalizing, dissolving ‘previous totalisations’. But Sartre's own text here develops a dialogism in the tension between these two possibilities which becomes an increasingly dominant characteristic of his regressive-progressive method and ends up by detotalizing the very totalization which he sought to prove. Here we find the theoretical corollary of what Althusser was to characterize as the tragic ‘double thesis’ of Sartre's ‘historicist humanism’, and which produced, in Michael Sprinker's words, a ‘ceaseless rebounding  between the poles of revolutionary optimism and historical pessimism’. Sartre himself theorizes this growing ambivalence as the difference between his own method and that of orthodox Marxism, elaborating the distinction between concept and incarnation as two possible paths of a dialectical understanding of the same social reality. The concept, as employed by orthodox Marxism, goes from the singular to the universal and therefore, Sartre claims, detotalizes in a movement of ‘decompressive expansion’, whereas incarnation involves ‘a way of totalizing compression which, on the contrary, seizes the centripetal movement of all the significations drawn in and condensed in the event or in the object’(II, 59). But it is rather Sartre's own text that seems to be caught between these two dialectical possibilities of expansion and compression in a double logic. Thus the very concept of totalization, distinguished from totality, must always be refused its prospective closure, for if ‘History continually effects totalisation of totalisations’(I, 15) it must necessarily also mean that by definition it can never be absolutely totalized. As he puts it in The Problem of Method : ‘For us the reality of the collective object rests on recurrence . It demonstrates that the totalization is never achieved and that the totality exists at best only in the form of a detotalized totality .’ How then can history totalize totalization if totalization is never accomplished? This is the point at which the dialectic, as a unity of method and movement, of subject and object, knower and known, requires the writing subject who must effectively hold them together. Thus the critical investigation takes place inside the totalisation and can be neither a contemplative recognition of the totalising movement, nor a particular, autonomous totalisation of the known totalisation. Rather it is a real moment of the developing totalisation… (I, 48) This means that the process of totalization must be kept moving by the critical investigation itself on which it comes to depend but which by the same token it can never subsume. Every time that Sartre asserts the enveloping movement of the historical process, while adding emphatically that he has yet not proved that such a totalization exists, he must always simultaneously introduce a counterstructure of repetition, so that his argument seems to fluctuate, like the groups that he describes, ‘in a state of perpetual detotalisation ’(I, 579). This is why although he dares to pose his overwhelming question, he can never be in a position to answer it with more than an assertion and the promise of more totalizations. The indetermination he sought to excise returns to govern him. The Critiques can do nothing but proliferate extravagantly into the writing of a perpetual process of deferral. If the singular universal increasingly punctuates the forward movement of Sartre's text instead of providing it with a dialectical meaning and direction, the problem that it was invoked to solve meanwhile takes its own aberrant course. Denying that conflict is an a priori structure actualized in historical  struggle, we have seen that Sartre does explain, through the category of the ‘practico-inert’(determining material conditions which have themselves been created by previous praxis), how individuals or classes in conflict produce a historical movement to which they are then subject. Actions, in turn, create the conditions for their own contradiction when the successful fulfilment of praxis is prevented by the action of another praxis whose aims conflict with it. The fact that conflict produces anti-labour, or a contingent situation that was not the original aim of either conflictual group, must mean that in this schema History has a negative unity, notwithstanding the troubled formulation of the singular-universal. If Sartre denies all possibility both of an underlying historical structure and of a larger unity, a ‘hyper-organism’ as he puts it, within which conflict takes place, then history as he conceptualizes it here has no specific or necessary direction. More seriously, it suggests that history will always deviate from any intended route and take an unforeseen one instead. If political struggle takes place for specific purposes and anticipated results, here Sartre seems to condemn it to an unending series of detours that will never arrive at their destination. Insofar as‘History’ names the horizon of totalization of those ethico-political meanings that point in the direction of social change, it here not only loses its single meaning, but threatens to lose even the bases on which its meaning is constituted. Sartre, therefore, cannot after all be said to substitute a simple voluntarism for an underlying historical structure. In the second Critique Sartre seems remarkably equivocal with regard to his central question of how struggles which have no controlling totalizer or underlying structure of totalization can be intelligible. He begins by allowing the possibility of schism, such as that which took place in the Roman Empire (II, 84), which implies that humans can choose not to allow totalization. He then admits that the result of any conflict, though it may be intelligible, may not necessarily imply any progress. Progress or improvement is no more likely than decline: he now repeatedly disowns any necessary historical logic of progress; its incarnations will always, strictly speaking, be accidental ones in relation to the objectives which were at the origin of praxis: [History]is not rigorous because it always proceeds by faults and corrections, because it is not in any way a universal schema but a unique adventure that unfolds on the basis of prehistoric circumstances which constitute in themselves, and in relation to all the objectives and all the practices, a heavy and badly understood legacy of fundamental deviations. (II, 238) History therefore does have a structure of sorts — a legacy of continual aberration. By abandoning any logic of progress for the negative synthesis of anti-labour which produces deviation, Sartre is, on the other hand, able to  account for the major detour that provides the context for his whole debate with Merleau-Ponty, and indeed for all post-war Marxism: the spectre of Stalinism. The problem, however, is that though Sartre produces a provocative analysis of why Stalin was successful, this imperceptibly slides into an account of why Stalin had to do what he did, to the extent that Sartre appears to justify his actions according to the particular necessities of his historical circumstances. Thus Sartre argues that it was necessary to choose between the break-up of the Revolution and its deviation. Stalinism, in fact, accords all too perfectly with the perverse structures of Sartre's own theoretical argument. It also serves, appropriately enough, as a way of closing down the aporias which have opened up in Sartre's text. Sartre takes the slogan ‘socialism in one country’ as an example of the unintended but necessary product of the anti-labour of the Stalin-Trotsky conflict. He translates the ‘socialism in one country’ of the one versus the ‘internationalism’of the other into a conflict between his own, now reified and separated, terms of concrete incarnation and abstract universalism:, the revolutionary incarnation chose the singular against the universal and the national against the international' (II, 223). Stalin therefore becomes the authentic Marxist, able to deal with specific historical circumstances, as against Trotsky who is regarded as having been hopelessly caught up with the a priori universalism of an abstract Marxism. According to Sartre, the Revolution's ‘incarnation directly contradicts its universalization,(II, 116). If he therefore demonstrates why socialism in one country was historically necessary, he ends up by apparently justifying Stalinism: in showing how anti-labour produces deviation, he seems to endorse its course while rejecting any overall schema which can provide the basis of a claim that it will be ultimately corrected. The analysis stops at the point where even Stalin's anti-semitism begins to appear necessary (II, 281). Sartre never broaches the question of the other crimes committed by Stalin (which is just as well in view of the way the argument is going) nor does he address the obvious problem that his own identification of Stalin as the practical Marxist of specificities against Trotsky's abstract universalism runs directly counter to the fact that Stalinism produced the most clear-cut example of a Marxism which internalized an abstract schema within itself. Instead, at this point Sartre at last abandons all hope of proving History as a totalization without a totalizer. He moves into a long attempt, which takes up the rest of the book, to revise the earlier ontology of Being and Nothingness into a new ontology of action and even of History, as if , after all, he is investigating the prospect of accrediting the latter with ontological status — a possibility which has always haunted his text in its insistent negation. This analysis, though lengthy, remains incomplete. In studying the deviation, Sartre himself deviated from his original project. But this was not just the effect of Stalin per se , despite his perverse attraction as a sort of singular-universal who did in effect unite ‘man’ with ‘history’: it was also the result of the  theoretical collapse of the singular-universal as a totalizing concept that could save history from the aberrant consequences of anti-labour. Sartre's philosophical grounding of ‘History’, therefore, foundered in the second volume when the logic of history inexorably brought him, not to totalization without a totalizer, but to the very reverse: the figure of Stalin and the conclusion that Stalinism had been indispensable for the development of socialism in the Soviet Union. Although the Critique had been intended to rescue Marxism from the sclerosis of Stalinism, Sartre found that his theory of history, far from explaining what had gone wrong when the most radical political theory turned out in practice to be one of the most oppressive, had rather shown why it had necessarily happened that way. Volume II was never completed, and only published, unfinished, in 1985. Thus Sartre's attempt to prove the truth of Marxism and of History at a philosophical level was abandoned. The basic theoretical problem had been to show how two or more autonomous and contradictory totalizations make up one dialectical intelligibility: to do this he needed to totalize the classes in struggle, and to discover the synthetic unity of a conflictual society. The articulation of individual praxis with History stood or fell with the concept of history as totalization without a totalizer. The stakes had been painfully clear to Sartre himself: ‘Marxism is rigorously true if History is totalization; it is not so any more if human history decomposes into a plurality of particular histories’(II, 25). The problem was that the premises of his own theory required the answer to this question to remain always in abeyance, while his text enacts rather than resolves the equivocality of the choice which it sets up. If Sartre began by attempting to unite man with history, in the notes at the very end of the manuscript he poses once more the fundamental ontological question, and immediately follows it with a decidedly unequivocal answer: IS HISTORY ESSENTIAL TO MAN? No. (II, 454) Sartre's argument for History as totalization, then, was already caught up in interminable difficulties by the time he was drafting Volume II of the Critique in 1958. No sooner had he published Volume I in 1960 than the whole status that he claimed for History, for man, and for their articulation, came under attack. V HISTORY AND ETHNOCENTRICITY The case of Sartre demonstrates why the assertion of ‘history’ against structuralism and poststructuralism must always remain problematical. In this context it is ironic that it was a structuralist critique of Sartre's claims for history that, in historical terms, brought about the abrupt intellectual demise of existential Marxism itself. Lévi-Strauss' famous objections to  Sartre, which appeared in the last chapter of The Savage Mind (1962), are sometimes represented as if they were merely a structuralist attack on Marxism. But their immediate occasion was as a response to the use that Sartre himself had made of Lévi-Strauss' The Elementary Structures of kinship (1949) in the first Critique . Sartre had stated that If there is to be any such thing as the Truth of History (rather than several truths, even if they are organized into a system), our investigation must show that the kind of dialectical intelligibility which we have described…applies to the process of human history as a whole (I, 64). For Sartre ‘human history’ was identified with the history of the West, and it was for this reason that Lévi-Strauss contested Sartre's claim to have established the human foundation of ‘a structural, historical anthropology’for Marxism. In retrospect, it was highly significant that resistance to Sartre's ‘History’ began by drawing attention to its ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism. Lévi-Strauss' critique of Sartre effectively takes the form of a deconstructive analysis: he begins by arguing that the Critique works by a double movement — just as, only four years later, Derrida was to suggest that the anthropologist's own work functions in exactly the same way. Lévi-Strauss focuses on the ambivalence which we have already seen to be such a distinctive feature of the Critique , pointing in particular to Sartre's vacillation between two concepts of dialectical reason. In the first he regards it as antithetical to analytical reason, as truth to error, while in the second he sees it as complementary to it. If this is the case, then Lévi-Strauss argues that Sartre disqualifies his own Critique , which establishes the truth of dialectical reason partly through the exercise of analytical reason, as any critique, which separates subject from object, knower from known, inevitably must. But then ‘it is difficult to see how analytical reason could be applied to dialectical reason and claim to establish it, if the two are defined by mutually exclusive characteristics’. Moreover, if the two eventually arrive at the same truth anyway then there seems to be little need for dialectical reason at all. ‘Sartre's endeavour seems contradictory in the one case and superfluous in the other’(246). While stressing that they both take their point of departure from Marx, Lévi-Strauss suggests that for him Marxism implies that the opposition between the two sorts of reason is relative, not absolute. It corresponds to a tension within human thought which may persist indefinitely de facto , but which has no basis de jure . (246) The two forms of reason do not exist independently of each other, as different forms of reality, but exist in relation to each other in an economy comparable to Derrida's differential ‘stricture’. Unknown to Lévi-Strauss, Sartre himself had already proposed that dialectical understanding itself works along two paths, one of ‘expansion’ and one of ‘compression’, which  suggests that having separated dialectical from analytical reason, he had then to reintroduce the latter under a new guise. The argument about the relation of the different kinds of reason to each other will doubtless (and necessarily) continue without resolution; what is important in the present context is that, in rearticulating the possibility that there is no absolute difference between the two, Lévi-Strauss puts into question Sartre's definitions of man, human history, and finally his concept of history in toto — all of which are predicated on the dialectic. If conflict is the motive force of history, and history a series of progressive dialectical totalizations, then Sartre claims that what he calls ‘backward societies’ have existed in a state of equilibrium and are therefore without history. He writes: There is no logical (dialectical) absurdity in the idea of a country with no History, where human groups would vegetate and never break out of a cycle of repetition, producing their lives with primitive techniques and instruments and knowing absolutely nothing of one another  (I, 126). In the background here is Hegel. According to Sartre, history is only born from a sudden imbalance of scarcity which disrupts all levels of society and initiates conflict and therefore progression. Many have objected that this analysis is hardly Marxist — insofar as Marxism takes the form of an analysis of the misappropriation of surplus value. But Lévi-Strauss rather objects to the ethnocentrism of Sartre's argument, for it means that ‘man’, the constituents of whom should have been the result and product of Sartre's anthropology, is defined in advance in terms of the dialectic as historical humanity, with history effectively restricted to societies of the West. The rest are excluded. It is exactly this assumption, however, that shows the extent to which Western society is indistinguishable from all other cultures, for each, according to Lévi-Strauss, has always assumed that it represents the full meaning and significance of human society: a good deal of egocentricity and naivety is necessary to believe that man has taken refuge in a single one of the historical or geographical modes of his existence, when the truth about man resides in the system of their differences and common properties. (249) Sartre's ethnocentricity derives from the whole project of his existentialism and his phenomenological definition of man in terms of the experiencing self defined against an other. Lévi-Strauss suggests that as a science anthropology should be attempting not to provide a definition of man as he is known experientially in our own society — an unscientific subjectivism — but should rather begin by ‘dissolving’ him. Here we encounter the first attempt to undo the category of ‘man’, an enterprise which has caused more distress than most in the recent history of the social sciences. Lévi-Strauss' point here, however, is simply the objection that Sartre defines ‘man’ in  advance, predetermined by the particular experience of what it is to be a man in twentieth-century post-war French society. The assumption that one's own experience, one's own gender, one's own society, constitutes the sole reality is in fact the very antithesis of the whole concept of any anthropology. Sartre, as Simon Clarke argues, ‘takes the conscious rationalization of his own culture for the ultimate meaning of humanity’. But how can Sartre claim to found a general anthropology when he defines it solely in terms of his own society? As soon as Lévi-Strauss shows that the experience on which Sartre bases his philosophy is not a universal one, then the general inferences for all humanity that he draws from it can no longer be justified. Sartre's existential consciousness cannot be dehistoricized into a general foundation for a concept of History. Having questioned the basis of Sartre's definition of man and the human according to the categories of civilization and primitivism, Lévi-Strauss focuses on this relation to history. It cannot, he argues, be tied to the notion of ‘man’ as if they were images of each other: We need only recognize that history is a method with no distinct object corresponding to it to reject the equivalence between the notion of history and the notion of humanity which some have tried to foist on us with the unavowed aim of making historicity the last refuge of a transcendental humanism: as if men could regain the illusion of liberty on the plane of the ‘we’ merely by giving up the ‘I's that are too obviously wanting in consistency. (262) In other words, Sartre's attempt to combine Marxism with existentialist subjectivity cannot resolve its difficulties through a shift from economism to history, for history implicitly continues to fulfil the same function anyway. Here Lévi-Strauss argues that behind the original question from which Sartre began — how can man make history if history makes him?— lurks another: if it is man who makes history, how does ‘History’ gain its exorbitant status as the desired, unachievable object of Sartre's text? His emphasis on the primacy of history means that he forms ‘an almost mystical conception of it’. Sartre seems to have remembered only half of Marx's and Freud's combined lesson. They have taught us that man has meaning only on the condition that he view himself as meaningful. So far I agree with Sartre. But it must be added that this meaning is never the right one : superstructures are faulty acts which have ‘made it’ socially. Hence it is vain to go to historical consciousness for the truest meaning. (253) Historical consciousness is necessarily ideological, even if dialectical, and can never in itself provide the one true meaning of history. Despite Sartre's reiteration that it is man who makes it, history increasingly assumes its own ontological status in the Critiques . Above all, Lévi-Strauss questions its status as totalization. The idea of history as the totalization of totalizations does not work. How total, he asks in a critique of totalization which Derrida would characterize as his first ‘classical’ formulation, can the totalization be? Can it include every historical fact? History names the process of constituting historical facts, and, particularly, of their selection. A history that included everything would amount to chaos: In so far as history aspires to meaning, it is doomed to select regions, periods, groups of men and individuals in these groups and to make them stand out, as discontinuous figures, against a continuity barely good enough to be used as a backdrop. A truly total history would cancel itself out — its product would be nought. (257) Meaning works through a form of metonymy, distinguishing between elements in terms of significance and insignificance, and that is why it must always be partial in relation to any text it interprets. (We might compare this to the way in which, in Sartre's later text, the synecdoche of the singular-universal insistently slides into the singularity of the event). Totalization in the first Critique , Lévi-Strauss suggests, can only create its meaning by selection through such metonymic devices of exclusion, that is, by founding itself on an — ethnocentric — absence. Historical consciousness dehistoricizes by shifting diachrony into a single synchronic totality: And so we end up in the paradox of a system which invokes the criterion of historical consciousness as a means for distinguishing the ‘primitive’ from the, civilized' but — contrary to its claim — is itself ahistorical. It offers not a concrete image of history but an abstract schema of men making history of such a kind that it can manifest itself in the trend of their lives as a synchronic totality. Its position in relation to history is therefore the same as that of primitives to the eternal past: in Sartre's system, history plays exactly the part of a myth. (254) History, far from constituting a privileged form of (historical) knowledge, is simply the myth of modern man, and merely amounts to a method of analysis. For all its stress on history and totalization as process, Sartre's argument is structured through the creation of a form of synchronicity. Lévi-Strauss demonstrates this through his well-known discussion of the function of the category of time. Like all models of knowledge, he suggests, history requires a code to analyse its object, and for most historians this code consists in chronology. The use of chronology in historical writing, or in literary history, gives the illusion that the whole operates by a uniform, continuous progression, a linear series in which each event takes its place. History is thus a process of a continuous unfolding. But in fact, Lévi-Strauss argues, the process model of  history is an illusion, for even dates do not work like that. Dates only work by being a member of a class. In itself, a date tells us nothing: it only takes on meaning when it is part of a series. However that class does not necessarily correspond to other sets of dates, periods, millennia, ages, etc. History is a discontinuous set composed of domains of history, each of which is defined by a characteristic frequency and by a differential coding of before and after . It is no more possible to pass between the dates which compose the different domains than it is to do so between natural and irrational numbers. Or more precisely: the dates appropriate to each class are irrational to all those of other classes. (259 — 60) So-called historical continuity is therefore often fraudulently constructed out of discontinuous sets which each have different temporalities. History can neither be total, nor a simple series of facts, nor a continuity. The fact that it must always involve codification and therefore also interpretation means that ‘historical knowledge has no claim to be opposed to other forms of knowledge as a supremely privileged one’(263). Historicity is a mode of knowledge for some societies but cannot ipso facto claim to be the fundamental basis of knowledge for all of them — a point that was to be re-emphasized by Foucault in The Order of Things . It is thus far from the case that the search for intelligibility comes to an end with history as such. Lévi-Strauss therefore makes three major criticisms of Sartre's concept of history. In the first place, he contests its equation with any anthropological definition of ‘man’; in the second, he argues that Sartre's description of history as making up one ‘History’ with one meaning is only achieved through the exclusion of all other histories with other meanings: the totalization can only totalize if everything which remains other to it is excluded. Sartre's definition is therefore tautological: it is one history because it is (only) one history. Specifically, Sartre creates a single history by excluding all histories except that of the West; his history as totalization can therefore only work through a determined ethnocentricity. In the third place, even in its own terms, the concept of history as a continuous development, a progressive totalization of totalizations, is dependent on a notion of chronology which assumes a synchronic homogeneous notion of time. But even historical chronology works through discontinuous sets, the elements in each class being defined only differentially in relation to the others in its class. This final criticism amounts to the challenge that Sartre's history can only ever be theorized as totalization insofar as it has been conceptualized as a synchronic form. While the criticism that Lévi-Strauss, structuralism emphasizes the synchronic at the expense of the diachronic has assumed the status of a critical truism, this in fact repeats the substance of his critique of Sartre, namely that the latter attempted to transform history into a space of synchronicity. Indeed totality in both Critiques presupposes a homogeneous temporality: the singular universal could only  ever work by presupposing what Althusser would call an ‘essential section’. Lévi-Strauss himself, like Althusser and Foucault, was preoccupied with the conceptualization of forms of heterogeneous temporality that consistently elude and trouble all theorization of history as a homogeneous diachrony. Lévi-Strauss' attack, together with Sartre's own theoretical difficulties which have already been charted, was effective enough to be quite devastating to the project of the Critique — which was never completed. Sartre took four years to respond, and when the reply eventually came even his most sympathetic admirers agreed that it did not succeed in answering the main criticisms. Lévi-Strauss' objections to Sartre's theory of history on the grounds of its ethnocentrism was certainly to the point, demonstrating that one lesson of Sartre's Herculean attempt to make history truth, and to give it one meaning, was the relation of such history to Western cultural imperialism. At the same time we should also recall that, as Levinas puts it ‘the best thing about philosophy is that it fails’. To the extent that Sartre's ontology does not succeed in totalizing history, it remains open to its irreducible otherness. perhaps this is one reason why, despite the Eurocentrism of his intended historical schema, Sartre himself could certainly not be accused of ethnocentrism in his politics; already the first Critique contains substantial analyses of the political and psychological structures of colonialism and racism, even if they have to be, as always, ‘dissolved in History ’(I, 716). But this still allows Sartre to argue, for example, for the legitimacy of the use of violence by colonized peoples against their oppressors, thus anticipating Fanon's dictum that colonization was achieved by violence and must therefore be overcome with it. Aronson sees Sartre's turn to the cause of resisting colonial oppression as an act of ‘self-flagellation’ and a product of politico-theoretical despair, but this passes over the historical and political context in which Sartre, and Les Temps modernes , played a leading role in the opposition to the Algerian war. In retrospect these concerns now seem a much bolder move, constituting an important political lead which was to be continued in the resistance to the war in South-East Asia in the sixties and early seventies. But Sartre's courageous intervention against French and other colonialisms could not have a corresponding theoretical impact so long as he retained his historicist Marxist framework. For his unitary theory of history has the effect of disallowing radical attempts at rewriting or retrieving other histories excluded by the West. Although it was taken by many as an attack on history as such, it was the critique of Marxist historicism initiated by Althusser that enabled new political possibilities in this direction."
ACA ACA-CTY-004 -0.86 "The scientific critique of historicism Before Sartre had even replied to Levi-Strauss criticisms, Althusser had published for Marx (1965), a work which, together with the later volume Reading Capital (1968), far from defending Sartre's Marxism from the structuralist challenge, completed the move against it, and offered a new interpretation of Marxism from which humanist existentialism and Hegelianism had been resolutely purged, with Sartre's voluntarism replaced by a more mediated form of economism. It is easy to represent Althusser's intervention purely in terms of structuralism, but to suggest that this was its only significant intellectual context is misleading. If his work needs to be considered in the context of the contemporary politics of the Communist Party, as several commentators have stressed, it also requires reference to work done in the history of the sciences, particularly that of Gaston Bachelard in the history of physics and chemistry, his pupil Georges Canguilhem in the life sciences, and Jean Cavaillès in mathematics. All four, together with Althusser's pupil, Michel Foucault, worked within an epistemological tradition which was critical of the positivism which, up to that time, had dominated the history of the sciences. To represent Althusser's work purely as a ‘structural Marxism’ therefore passes over the fact that there were distinct intellectual traditions in France whose difference was particularly pronounced in their respective philosophies of history. Much of what has been considered to be poststructuralism's wild disregard for history can be accounted for by the fact that it was operating within this — largely unknown outside France — anti-empiricist and anti-positivist tradition. In 1978 Foucault suggested that post-war French philosophy divides according to a line ‘which separates a philosophy of experience, meaning and the subject from a philosophy of savoir , rationality and the concept’: in other words, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, against Cavaillès, Bachelard and Canguilhem, or the return-to-Hegel of Kojève in the thirties, versus the return-to-Rant initiated in the philosophy of the sciences by Léon Brunschvicg in the late nineteenth century. Long before Sartre developed his own form of Marxist-Hegelian history, Bachelard had been working in a critical relation to Hegelian historicism. What was new in Althusser was that for the first time this epistemological tradition was developed for a Marxism. Against Sartre's claim to establish Marxism's truth philosophically, Althusser reasoned that if Marxism is a science, then the history of Marxism ought to conform to the kind of history that had been developed for the sciences. The question then simply became whether it did or not. Or so it seemed. The difficulties in which Althusser subsequently became enmeshed were the result of his ignoring Canguilhem's warning that although the history of science takes science for its object, it is not itself a science, and therefore cannot claim to be value-free (or, in Marxist terms, non-ideological). As Gregory Elliott has recently emphasized, although Althusser always presented himself as the figure of the rigours of orthodoxy against the eclecticism of the existentialists, in his own work he was just as catholic, allying Marxism with non-Marxist philosophy, even if it was a history of science to which, he claimed, ‘French philosophy owes its renaissance in the last thirty years’. II BACHELARD AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE Against the Hegelian synthesis of all kinds of history within the same developmental schema, Bachelard argued that the history of science cannot be assimilated into the progressive evolutionary form commonly ascribed to other kinds of human history, and nor can it be mapped on a one-to-one basis against the history of its age. In certain pure sciences, mathematics for instance, although discoveries may enable changes and developments of a material kind, their occurrence cannot ipso facto be explained by being related to the allegedly determining political and economic history of their immediate era. As Levi-Strauss was to argue, different histories have different temporalities: the time scales of the sciences do not work at the same pace as other forms of history: they have their own dynamic, their own rhythm, their own times, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, that do not operate by the ordinary round of the year; Bachelard was fond of pointing out that from a scientific point of view the ten years from 1920 to 1930 were as long an era as the previous five hundred. This unevenness of development means that there can be no general history of science as such: it is uneven but it cannot be combined. Many sciences moreover share the characteristic that a major discovery means that all other models and theories are simply out of date and have to be discarded. From the point of view of the present, the past has to be excised. Contemporary science is able to designate itself, through its revolutionary discoveries, as a liquidation of a past . Here discoveries are exhibited which send back all recent history to the level of a prehistory. Here we do indeed find an example of a ‘liquidation’ of history which, it will be recalled, is exactly the accusation that Terry Eagleton makes against poststructuralism; but the actual example in Bachelard demonstrates how much more complex the issue turns out to be. Science's negative relation to the past emerges as one of its most distinctive and significant aspects, one which marks a complete break with the cumulative structures of the arts and social sciences. It means, in particular, that the temporality of science cannot be accommodated to the rhythms of traditional historiography, which has not, however, prevented positivistic historians of science from writing its history solely in terms of precursors and anachronistic anticipations of modern ideas in early thinkers, as if science unrolled smoothly and inevitably from year to year. The problem with this approach is that it overestimates the extent of narrative continuity in the history of science which, according to Bachelard's examples, works rather by sudden disruptions, discontinuities, and entire reorganizations of its principles. Science is forever remaking its own history. As early as 1934 Bachelard had argued that the revolutionary changes in physics, such as relativity theory and microphysics, meant that science itself was currently defined by its reaction against the past, and had become a ‘philosophy of the non,— non-Cartesian, non-Euclidean, non-Newtonian, and non-Baconian. These major transformations cannot be mapped onto the model of a continuous history, for its stress on putative anticipations fails to account for the way in which the whole form of knowledge can be transformed and a new understanding created. Bachelard's work on the formation of scientific disciplines led him to argue that the proper form of historical analysis should focus not upon an empirical history but upon the cognitive or epistemological status of concepts that distinguish a new science from an old one. Those concepts have not evolved from the old ones, for it is precisely their radical difference that constitutes the new science, the new ‘positivity’, produced by what he termed an ‘epistemological rupture’. Bachelard himself preferred to give examples of such ruptures rather than theorize how they took place. Althusserians subsequently placed much emphasis upon the ‘epistemological break’, and were in turn castigated for being unable to explain how it occurred. But this neglects the force of Althusser's emphasis on Marxism as itself a theoretical practice with its own history of epistemological self-correction, a possibility derived from the work of the mathematician Jean Cavaillès, who stressed the degree to which the history of mathematics, particularly set theory, could be accounted for by the dialectical development of the concept. Much of the emphasis on set theory in Lacan and others, as well as the similarity of certain of their ideas to those of Gödel, whose work Cavaillès utilizes, can be attributed to his influence: indeed it would be possible to argue that the whole emphasis in post-war French thinkers on a non-contradictory heterogeneity in which incompatible or incommensurable elements are juxtaposed against or as part of each other is  derived as much from set theory as from Freud. Cavaillès developed these ideas into a theory of science as such, which, he argued, changed not through empirical discovery but through the theoretical reworking of its own concepts in the ‘pure’ sciences. This view, whereby science progresses through the dialectic of its concepts rather than by testing its hypotheses against ‘experience’, was developed significantly by both Bachelard and Althusser. If it enabled the latter the crucial theoretical move of being able to reject the classical empiricist conception of knowledge, it was also to put him in the position of even castigating as ‘historicist’ any attempts to account for theoretical discourse in terms of its historical conditions of production — perhaps one of the major ways in which he differed from Canguilhem and Foucault. Bachelard and Cavaillès agree that the distinguishing characteristic of modern science is the degree to which it has become separated from common-sense knowledge so that consciousness and its concepts are now opposed: The break between ordinary and scientific knowledge seems to us so clear that these two types of knowledge could not have the same philosophy. Empiricism is the philosophy which corresponds to ordinary knowledge. There empiricism finds its origin, its evidence, its development. By contrast, scientific knowledge is bound up with rationalism and, whether one wishes it or not, rationalism is allied to science, and demands scientific goals. The use of scientific instruments in particular means that scientific perception is constantly at odds with the experience of everyday perception. Because scientificity is achieved through a break with common-sense forms of thinking, termed ‘epistemological obstacles’, Bachelard, like Lévi-Strauss and Althusser after him, argues that any philosophy such as existentialism that is founded on the basis of the truth of the experience of the knowing subject is bound to involve illusory or ideological forms of thought. For this reason, Bachelard refers ironically to Sartre's phenomenology as a belated form of alchemy. But if the new science is produced through a rupture with the ‘errors’ of the old, the tenacious hold of common-sense forms of thought means that any given text may simultaneously embody aspects of the old and new ways of thinking, theoretical and ideological frameworks that Bachelard, and Althusser after him, term ‘problematics’: Instead of the parade of universal doubt, scientific research requires the establishment of a problematic . It takes its real departure from a problem , even if it is badly set up. The scientific I is then a programme of experiments , whereas the non-scientific I is already a constituted problematic . Bachelard tries to think through the problem of how epistemological obstacles operated both before and after scientificity. In particular, he suggests that the educational system has a marked effect on the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge, and criticizes it for the ahistorical way in which it teaches scientific problems, theories, experiments and proofs. While pedagogy continues the myth of an elementary or easy science, language itself can also produce difficulties. The nomenclature of science does not refer to definitive concepts: It is ceaselessly adjusted, completed, varied. The language of science is in a state of permanent semantic revolution. Obstacles such as these lead Bachelard to formulate a theory of ‘material psychoanalysis’ which offers a ‘psychoanalysis of objective knowledge’to account for and think through the problem of epistemological obstacles. It is also supposed to have a therapeutic effect of a ‘brutal, surgical’ separation of unconscious and rational convictions in order‘to cure us of our images or at least to limit their power’. This separation between scientific and common-sense knowledge in turn produces a significant effect on Bachelard's thinking about history. For, as Lecourt describes it, he attempts to elaborate a system of concepts which will make it possible to think the intrication of two histories : that of the scientific and the non-scientific in the practice of the scientists. Hence this project culminates in Le rationalisme appliqué with the project of an epistemological history which is presented as a dual history; a ‘ratified history’(or history of the scientific in scientific practice) and a ‘lapsed history’(or history of the interventions of the non-scientific in scientific practice). This means that science can have two histories, which constantly intertwine but never resolve, with one evaluated as positive, the other as negative and therefore silently suppressed even though it may remain determining. Instead of upholding one at the expense of the other, Bachelard offers the possibility of a deconstructive history which would reinscribe that which had been excluded; this could also enable a differential history of science and ideology, accounting for the perpetuation of ideology after the production of science. To do so, Bachelard, as Althusser was to do later, invokes the use of psychoanalysis for the study of history and ideology. The notion of the epistemological break, while offering a theory of scientificity, and even of ideology, implied a very different view of history from that of Sartre. In some sense, it went to the other extreme, for from a totalizing history it projected a form of history in which there was no attempt to link different histories at all. Bachelard assumed the necessary division of the scientific from the non-scientific, even if de facto he was continually encountering their imbrication and finding himself in the  position of trying to keep them apart. Lecourt has pointed to the absence of ‘a concept that would enable him to think together several histories with different statuses; in short, the concept of a differential history’. Such a general concept was to be provided by Althusser's theory of relative autonomy within a structure in dominance. III ALTHUSSER AND THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY Althusser's rereading of Marx can thus be as usefully considered in the context of theories of the history of science as of structuralism; a certain conflation between the two has been possible because both were opposed to humanistic and phenomenological theories of knowledge in general and to historicism in particular. Within the general framework of his attack on the humanistic Hegelian tradition of Western Marxism, Althusser's specific objection to Sartre's attempt to mediate Marxism with existential subjectivity was that such a move went against the crucial discoveries which had founded Marxism in the first place; in an extension of Lévi-Strauss' argument, he maintained that the notion of ‘man’ that Sartre used was derived from a particular ideological definition of the human subject which represses Marx's insight that the human subject is not the centre of history, together with Freud's that the subject is not centred in consciousness. For Althusser both history and the subject are equally decentred: his attack on Sartre's claims for a unitary history (however complex its textual elaboration may have proved to be) was therefore accompanied by a critique of the notion of the unitary human subject that constitutes it. One way of characterizing Althusser's intervention would be Martin Jay's observation that he effectively destroyed the Lukácsian notion of totality. Another would be to say he attempted to theorize the very position that Sartre had fought to get out of. If Sartre's argument depended on a logic of history as totalization but broke down when he could not combine the praxis of the individual with the general logic of ‘totalization without a totalizer’ except through the proliferation of his own writing, Althusser, by contrast, exploited the possibility of history as a ‘process without a subject’, a history characterized by radical breaks and discontinuities, distinct from each other and not totalizing. It was this aspect of Althusserian theory, perhaps more than any other, that led many orthodox Marxists to consider that Althusser was not really a Marxist at all. The accusation that poststructuralism neglects history undoubtedly harks back above all to the work of Althusser who, more than anyone else, appears to have attempted to eliminate history. Notwithstanding their philosophical and political differences, there are nevertheless certain similarities between Althusser's and Sartre's projects when viewed in relation to orthodox Marxism. Althusser shared Sartre's opposition to Stalinism's emphasis on economism and technical  determinism, dissociating himself from it not through an assertion of individual agency but through a reformulation of the Marxist thesis of determination by economic relations — redefined as a causal rather than a historical relation. At the same time Althusser argued that Sartre had not isolated the central problems of orthodox Marxist theory, and as a result continued to work with some of its more questionable preconceptions. In particular, in spite of his attempt to avoid positing history as an a priori transcendent law, in the published first volume of the Critique he had still utilized an organicist teleological model of history which assumes that the end is already implicit in the beginning, and that history rolls forward to a determined end. Both Stalinism and Sartreanism assume that history is an emancipatory process of self-realization, even if the forces of production in the one are replaced by the praxis of the self-conscious human subject in the other. Althusser termed such a view ‘historicism’: an abstract philosophical scheme that imposes an overall process of transformation upon historical events. At first glance, it might seem as if Althusser himself gave up history and tried science instead. Like Sartre, he sought to constitute Marxism as a form of truth, but attempted to prove its truth not through the dialectic of history but rather as a science, authenticating Marx's ‘immense theoretical revolution’ epistemologically through a demonstration of its scientificity. In order to claim a scientific status for Marxism as knowledge rather than ideology, or non-knowledge, Althusser invoked Bachelard's historical epistemology which allowed him to posit the idea of a radical discontinuity between the two, with Marxist science separated from earlier forms of non-knowledge in Marx's texts by an ‘epistemological break’. This necessarily meant that Althusser endorsed Bachelard's arguments about empiricism and rejected the concept of history as a system of progression or evolution. However Althusser found it difficult to maintain a Marxist theory of history while avoiding its customary Hegelian form. His basic argument, that Marx proposed a new conception of knowledge defined against Hegelianism, implied an accompanying revision of the Hegelian concept of history, which, as we have seen in the cases of Lukács and Sartre, had hitherto provided the dominant model of Marxist historicism. Althusser's theory of history has been more widely attacked and denigrated than any other aspect of his work, largely because he dared to argue that, far from providing the unassailable foundation of Marxism, history was a problematic concept even in Marx's own texts: this apparently full word is in fact theoretically an empty word, in the immediacy of its obviousness — or rather, it is the ideology-fulfilment which surfaces in this lapse of rigour. Anyone who reads Capital without posing the critical question of its object sees no malice in this word that ‘speaks’ to him: he happily continues the discourse whose first word this word may be, the ideological discourse of history, and then the historicist  discourse. As we have seen and as we understand, the theoretical and practical consequences are not so innocent. (143) Althusser argues that Marx's intervention did not merely amount to the historicization of the formal categories of the classical economists. If this was the case all he would have done would have been to Hegelianize Ricardo. Marxists often imply that Marxism simply involves the introduction of a historical framework —‘always historicize!’— but this assumption can only be made, according to Althusser, because of‘the confusion that surrounds the concept of history ’: In reality, it is to introduce as a solution a concept which itself poses a theoretical problem, for as it is adopted and understood it is an uncriticized concept, a concept which, like all ‘obvious’ concepts, threatens to have for theoretical content no more than the function that the existing or dominant ideology defines for it. It is to introduce as a theoretical solution a concept whose status has not been examined, and which, far from being a solution, is in reality a theoretical problem. (93) Historicism presumes that a concept of history can be borrowed for Marxism from Hegel or from the practice of empiricist historians without difficulty and without asking how such a concept is specific to Marxism: for Althusser the crucial question is to ask ‘what must be the content of the concept of history imposed by Marx's theoretical problematic?’ That problematic cannot be identical to Hegel's because both Hegel and Marx define historical time in terms of the social totality: insofar as their definitions of the social totality can be shown to differ, so also will their concepts of historical time. For Flegel ‘historical time is merely the reflection in the continuity of time of the internal essence of the historical totality incarnating a moment of the development of the concept’(93). Historical time is the existence of the essence of the social totality and will therefore indicate its structure. Althusser isolates two key characteristics of Hegelian historical time, ‘its homogeneous continuity and its contemporaneity’. The first is well known: here time is the ‘continuum in which the dialectical continuity of the process of the development of the Idea is manifest’(94). In this schema the science of history consists of the problem of the division of this continuum into the periods that constitute successive dialectical totalities. The second characteristic, the contemporaneity of historical time, that is, the category of the historical present, is more complex but an essential element in the whole Hegelian model of history, indeed is its condition of possibility. If historical time is the existence of the social totality then the relation between the two must be one of immediacy, allowing what Althusser calls an ‘essential section’, that is ‘a break in the present such that all the elements of the whole revealed by this section are in an immediate relationship with one another, a relationship that immediately expresses their internal essence’. This section is possible precisely because the unity of the whole is an expressive totality, that is ‘a totality all of whose parts are so many ‘total parts ’ each expressing the others, and each expressing the social totality that contains them, because each in itself contains in the immediate form of its expression the essence of the totality itself’(94). Hegel's conception of historical time, then, reflects his conception of the intrinsic unity between all parts of the social totality, each a part of the whole and the whole present in each part, so that history too partakes of a self-reflective immediacy which paradoxically makes it ahistorical. Perhaps surprisingly, given his alleged ‘structuralism’, Althusser argues that the structuralist distinction between synchrony and diachrony rests upon this Hegelian version of historical time which is both continuous and contemporaneous with itself. Against this Althusser maintains that time, even chronological time, is not just an empirical entity, but a concept; that though history may be articulated in general with chronological time, each history has its own temporality, which can only be found by establishing the conceptual nexus of the history in question. In order to determine what an event is, we must know the concept of the history in which the event is to occur. For example, in order to understand the history of physics, we have to know the concept or problematic of physics in order to establish what an event in physics consists of. Of course a chronological narrative can be constructed, but the history of physics in fact has its own temporality in which the first event after Aristotle was Newton, the second was Einstein, the third black holes, etc. Now this specific temporality will have no homogeneous relation to, say, the history of literature. However, it can be articulated with other histories, indeed is articulated, according to the overall but decentred totality of the particular mode of production. Sometimes Althusser seems to imply that different histories may range through different modes of production, at other times it appears that they are specific to each, an effect of the overdetermination of the social formation. But in either case, unlike the Hegelian essential section, where each event can be shown to be in an essential articulation with the whole in a continuous and homogeneous spatio-temporality, a cross-section at any particular moment will show a heterogeneous array of presences and absences. Althusser elaborates his thesis that Marxism is not a historicism at some length, presenting a critique of the historicist and humanist traditions which he takes back from Sartre to the beginning of the century, even to the Russian Revolution itself, and in which he also includes the ‘absolute historicism’ of Gramsci and the Frankfurt School. Above all, he criticizes the ways in which Hegel reduces the diverse historical totality of a society to a single internal principle, so that history occurs only through the principle of contradiction in the dialectic. For Althusser, the apparently simple contradiction is always overdetermined: the inversion of Hegel's single principle to a dialectic generating successive modes of production  amounts to economism. This objection holds equally for Sartre's Hegelian historicism, the effect of which is to reduce the multiplicity of different practices to a single practice, ‘real ’ history’(136). Sartre's historicism shares the common tendency of all historicist interpretations of Marxism which transform ‘the Marxist totality into a variant of the Hegelian totality’: they all share the structure of the contemporaneity of a temporal presence and continuity which allows the possibility of an essential section. paradoxically therefore, Althusser argues, humanist Marxism shares the same basic theoretical principles with the orthodox economist Marxism of the Second International which politically it was its aim to oppose: for whether passive or active, fatalist or voluntarist, both reduce Marxist analysis to a single theoretical problematic. All that has happened is that the relations of production have been turned into historicized human relations. IV THE LONELY HOUR Althusser's procedure has been to show that, within a notion of history that seemed as if it could be invoked on its own as self-evident, there rests an entire presupposition about the conception of the social whole that is not derived from Marxist theory. The Marxist concept of historical time must instead, he argues, be thought through ‘on the basis of the Marxist conception of the social totality’(97). That Marxist conception is, of course, the Althusserian one: in Althusser's reading of Marx the unity of the whole is precisely not that of the Hegelian — and Sartrean — expressive totality; rather it is constituted through overdetermination, through: a certain type of complexity , the unity of a structured whole containing what can be called levels or instances which are distinct and ‘relatively autonomous’, and coexist within this complex structural unity, articulated with one another according to specific determinations, fixed in the last instance by the level or instance of the economy. (97) The Hegelian model of the coexistence of presence which allows the possibility of the ‘essential section’ is incompatible with this description, but Althusser continues to assume nevertheless that there is a totality and that it has ‘the structure of an organic hierarchised whole ’(98). This structure, made up of a succession of different levels or instances, is dominated by one form of production which forces the unity of any conjuncture, the non-economic structures determined ‘in the last instance’ by the economic (99). This last description is often misunderstood: the point is that the economic is never a simple causal function that operates alone: the economic dialectic is never active in the pure state ; in History, these instances, the superstructures, etc. — are never seen to step respectfully aside when their work is done or, when the Time comes, as his pure  phenomena, to scatter before His Majesty the Economy as he strides along the royal road of the Dialectic. From the first moment to the last, the lonely hour of the ‘last instance’ never comes. The significance of the allusion to Freud in this famous passage is to suggest that to conceive of the economic as operating in isolation is as illusory as to imagine that the ego can operate without the unconscious: they are both the reciprocal products of the other. The ‘last instance’, the economic, never operates in isolation separate from all the other instances of the social totality: it is the lonely hour that never comes. If one were to pursue the analogy with Freud rigorously, Althusser is even suggesting here that the primacy of the economic (ego) is a delusion, and that the superstructure (unconscious) is the more fundamental determining force, or at the very least that they are equally overdetermined. Whereas Sartre's totality was never totalized because it was always still in process and could never be closed, Althusser's totality is never totalizable because it is decentred and displaced in time. The different structured levels do not coexist in a temporal present which coincides with ‘the presence of the essence with its phenomena’. This means that the model of continuous and homogeneous time which Lévi-Strauss had also argued against cannot here be regarded as the time of history. This has nothing to do with turning diachrony into synchrony; the point is rather that it is no longer possible to think the process of the development of the different levels of the whole in the same historical time . Each of these different ‘levels’ does not have the same type of historical existence. On the contrary, we have to assign to each level a peculiar time , relatively autonomous and hence relatively independent, even in its dependence, of the ‘times’ of the other levels… Each of these peculiar histories is punctuated with peculiar rhythms and can only be known on condition that we have defined the concept of the specificity of its historical temporality and its punctuations (continuous development, revolutions, breaks, etc.). (99–100) These histories, their temporalities defined according to the specific concepts of particular domains, are not, however, independent of the whole: they are dependent on it, but in a structure derived from the ‘differential relations between the different levels within the whole…the mode and degree of independence of each time and history is therefore necessarily determined by the mode and degree of dependence of each level within the set of articulations of the whole’(100). So if there are different histories, they must nevertheless be related to those other histories from which they differ but with which they, articulate in a structure of relative effectivity. Such histories are constituted according to a Saussurian differential relation. Althusser therefore criticizes the Annales historians for merely arguing that  periodizations differ for different times, and that each time has its own rhythms. This is not enough, for it is also necessary to ‘think these differences in rhythm and punctuation in their foundation, in their type of articulation, displacement and torsion which harmonizes these different times with one another’— though it must be added that this begs the question of how such harmonization is achieved. For such times are not even necessarily the obvious ones, ‘the visible sequences of events recorded by the chronicler’, they may be invisible, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of…different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, only visible when their particular concepts are constructed and produced ‘out of the differential nature and differential articulation of their objects in the structure of the whole’(101–03). As an example of what he means, Althusser refers to Foucault's, remarkable studies',Madness and Civilization and The Birth of the Clinic , two instances in which the historian has had to construct the concept of their history. This is antipodal to the empirically visible history in which the time of all histories is the simple time of continuity and in which the ‘content’ is the vacuity of events that occur in it which one later tries to determine with dividing procedures in order to ‘periodise’that continuity. Instead of these categories, continuity and discontinuity, which summarize the banal mystery of all history, we are dealing with infinitely more complex categories specific to each type of history, categories in which new logics come into play. (103) This means that if one tries to take an ‘essential section’ there is no essence revealed which is the present of each level; indeed the break valid for one history would not necessarily correspond to that valid for any other which will live in a different time and in a different rhythm. The present of one level is, so to speak, the absence of another, and this co-existence of a ‘presence’ and absences is simply the effect of the structure of the whole in its articulated decentricity. (104) Any determinate mode of production, therefore, will evidence such a form of historical existence in its social formation: dislocated, uneven, absent and present. There is, Althusser stresses, no ‘single ideological base time, to which all these different temporalities can be related, no ordinary ‘single continuous reference time’ which they can be seen to dislocate (105). This differential account of history requires us to rethink a whole series of common notions such as unevenness of development, of survivals, backwardness, even, Althusser claims, the contemporary economic practice of under-development' — notions that provide the very basis of Western ethnocentrism. It also means that there can be no history in general, only specific structures of historicity. Nor is history an evolving totality; each mode of production is made up  of differentiated histories. These differentiated histories form a specific historical totality, for each history operates within the general totality of the mode of production. The economic therefore determines each history or level to the extent that its history is structured differentially against the totality which is defined as a specific mode of production. If for Hegel historical time is the reflection in time of the essence of the historical totality, for Althusser it is a function of the structure of the totality arising from a particular mode of production. No totality has a necessary transcendence embodied within it; as for the later Sartre, the course of historical change is open and will work only through the overdetermination of particular historical conjunctures. Althusser suggests that although Marxist history is defined as a theory of the modes of production, Marx did not give us any theory of how the transition was effected from one mode of production to another, nor of how each mode of production was constituted. Much of the effort of Althusserian Marxism was taken up with trying to produce such a theory, and it was the failure to produce it that perhaps was the main reason for its subsequent collapse. Althusser's influence declined in France after 1968, partly as a result of the role played by the PCF, of which Althusser was a member, in the events of May 1968, and partly as an effect of a number of critiques of his work, some of them by Althusser himself. In Britain by contrast Althusser's greatest impact occurred in the decade that followed: from the late sixties his work constituted something like a hegemonic ‘theory in dominance’. After 1978, however, the influence of Althusser declined rapidly after a series of books by two Marxist sociologists, Barry Hindess and Paul Hirst, who developed and extended the implications of those critiques already made in France. Their work made it impossible henceforth to invoke the work of Althusser in Britain without reference to the problems which they had articulated. With Hindess and Hirst criticism of Althusser's theory of history shifted to the problematic of the relation of the concept (increasingly assimilated to representation) to the real, thus reducing it to a question of epistemology. Where, though, does this leave the concept of history in Althusser? Does it have its own specificity aside from the problems of the subject, representation, narrative and interpretation, with which many have now shown that it is necessarily involved? Does this mean, as Hirst suggests, that the only concept of history must in fact still be the Hegelian one?: Teleology and spirituality are essential mechanisms of all philosophies of history. And, save for mindless antiquarianism or utter scepticism, there can be no history without a philosophy of history. It is in the philosophy of history that the past becomes a possible and rational object of knowledge. It is through the conception of historical time as a continuum that the past becomes a coherent object. For Hirst this means that there can be no Marxist ‘science of history’ that can be opposed to the essentialism and teleology of a philosophy of history. Althusser's mistake, according to Hirst, was to attempt to construct another philosophy of history; but any theory of history, he contends, cannot do without teleology, spirituality (the realization of the Idea), and the continuum. On the other hand, we would add that the lesson of Hegel's, Marx's, and Sartre's attempt also suggests that history cannot be coherently essentialist and teleological either. Hirst's straightforward characterization of Althusser's work as ‘a failure’ does not acknowledge the constant tension in the historical project itself. If Sartre's endeavour to ground the Marxist science of history suggests that the Hegelian totality and continuum can only work by a continual labour of excluding the partial and discontinuous, Althusser's effort to constitute a differentiated history shows that you cannot do it without a teleology. What both demonstrate is that any history as such has to think both, simultaneously. As long as history is assumed to operate according to the protocols of a conventional logic, where a contradiction simply means you cannot think it or do it as Hirst supposes, then it remains at the impasse he describes. Althusser's significant contribution was to problematize the concept of history by addressing its presuppositions about temporality — an area which Hindess and Hirst altogether neglect. In order to make their claim that his decentred totality is still expressive and therefore essentialist, they have to ignore the arguments about temporality in the critique of the Hegelian essential section as ‘the co-existence of presence’, and thus fail to do justice to the way in which Althusser constructs, as Foucault puts it, ‘a counter-memory — a transformation of history into a totally different form of time’. If the Althusserian mode of production is made up of differential times and histories, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of the different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, then each element cannot express the whole because the whole is only accessible as a concept, which is precisely not expressed at all. For the concept, ‘like every concept, is never immediately ‘given’, never legible in visible reality: like every concept this concept must be produced, constructed’— by the analyst. This formulation enabled Althusser to theorize a decentred totality which allowed the possibility of differences without reducing each instance to the operation of an essence or a single principle, such as the dialectic. If his notion of the mode of production as such a totality could not be sustained in a differential relation to other modes of production (notions of residual and emergent forms notwithstanding), Althusser nevertheless offered a particularly interesting theorization of the problems involved in the concept of the historical, articulating the paradoxical conditions of any theorization of history. If he showed it to be an impossible concept, he continued to demonstrate that it remains a necessary one, and acknowledged that we must learn to live with that impossibility. How does this take place? It is at this point that the subject of history re-enters; history may be a process without one, but the subject is nevertheless inscribed within history. Once again, as for Sartre, the subject operates at the pivot of the paradox. For the subject does not understand history according to its scientific formulation, but undergoes the process of inter-pellation at the level of ideology, and thus experiences it through the formulas of historicism. History, which can now no longer be considered a concept as such, is therefore made up of the incommensurable relation between these two disjunctive set-ups. It therefore operates for Althusser both at the level of science and of ideology, not in terms of truth to falsity, but as an irresolvable dialectic between the differential relations of the mode of production and the historicism of the ideological notion of history. Hence his argument that ‘the knowledge of history is no more historical than the knowledge of sugar is sweet’. What then is the relation of science to ideology, of Althusserian history to its ideological historicist formulation? The gap between them, according to Althusser, is mediated by art. This statement is often regarded as a curious relic of the values of bourgeois culture. But it is also possible to see it as an attempt to formulate the way in which the sliding incompatibility of the two can only be perceived through an ‘internal distantiation’ in which the problem of that ‘relation’is enacted by its relation , in the sense of the telling of a story — which is how we get history. If history is a process, Althusser remarks, ‘there is no such thing as a process except in relations [sous des rapports ]’. History is a matter of relations, and thus of writing reports. Althusser thus suggests that history can only be thought through as a permanent contradiction: it is a totality, but that totality is a decentred structure in dominance in which each history's history is defined not through its identity with, or difference from, a general history but by being differentiated from every other history, on which it is necessarily also therefore dependent, in a kind of negative totalization. Within the realm of ideology, on the other hand, history is experienced by subjects as a purposive continuum, with themselves as its subject. Another way of putting this would be to say that Althusser demonstrated that according to the protocols of conventional logic, history is impossible. If you try to think of it as a closed totality you get into the problems of historicism; if you try to think of it as entirely differentiated, then it becomes meaningless since there is no necessary connection, positive or negative, to anything else, nor would any one history produce any effect on another. Any differential theory of identity must think both totality and difference simultaneously. It is this structure which both Sartre's ‘singular universal, and Althusser's relative autonomy within a structure in dominance attempt to formulate, and in both cases the in-between of such simultaneity emerges as the process of writing itself. V ‘IF THERE IS HISTORY’: HISTORY, HERMENEUTICS AND HISTORICITY With Sartre and Althusser we encounter the two poles of post-war French return-to-Marxism. Although both could be said to be reacting against the ossification of Stalinism, the subjectivist and ultra-objectivist paths that they followed were antithetical. This schematic characterization, however, does not do justice either to the manner in which they attempted to keep both poles in play at once, nor to the way in which they came to concede the impossibility of the theoretical projects which they undertook. To dismiss them as failures on this account, however, would be merely reductive. Their real force can be discerned from the extent to which the problematics they set up have continued to exercise subsequent writers. Since Sartre and Althusser no one has attempted a new theorization of a Marxist history. We are not, therefore, now looking at another paradigm, another system. Rather than attempting to repeat and surpass the exalted projects of Sartre or Althusser in a new guise, later writers such as Foucault or Derrida learnt a lesson from history, and stopped to ask why such comprehensive theories, like so many of those which preceded them, could not hold together. For the grand narrative of History was always too big for its boots. Instead, therefore, of excluding history as has so often been claimed, such thinkers begin, in a rather more conventional way, from the anti-historicist perspectives of Althusser, even, arguably, of Sartre. The generic label ‘poststructuralist’ is here useful merely as a shorthand to designate those contemporary writers who share not a hostility to history as such but a distrust of simple historicisms. Lyotard, for example, is best known for his scepticism towards historicist universal narratives, advocating instead the possibility of a multiplicity of heterogeneous, conflicting and incommensurable histories. Foucault works from exactly the same tradition in the philosophy and history of science as Althusser: like him he utilizes Bachelard's concept of differentiated histories, which still stands as the major alternative, epistemic or otherwise, to historicism. If such a theorization of history, as diacritical and singular, articulated according to breaks and ruptures, was by no means new even with Althusser, it has been continued as a self-conscious derivation from him by Derrida. In Positions Derrida comments: Althusser's entire, and necessary, critique of the ‘Hegelian’ concept of history and of the notion of an expressive totality, etc., aims at showing that there is not one single history, a general history, but rather histories different in their type, rhythm, mode of inscription — intervallic, differentiated histories. I have always subscribed to this. Contrary to the claims of certain American commentators, Derrida's uncharacteristically emphatic endorsement here of Althusser's project  with regard to the possibility of ‘intervallic, differentiated’ histories, suggests the problems involved in invoking Althusser as an ‘answer’to Derrida; both are equally distrustful of any form of Hegelian historicism. This does not, however, mean that they then take up identical positions in relation to the problem of history. Derrida has not been concerned to formulate a new philosophy of history; nor has he attempted to specify new methodologies in the manner of Foucault. Describing himself as ‘very wary of the concept of history’, Derrida has rather attempted to shift the problem away from the conceptual analysis of history as an ‘Idea’ which, perhaps more than anything else, has proved to be Hegel's most enduring legacy, towards an analysis of the interstices in the implications of the general system in which it operates. In the first instance, therefore, he focuses not on history as such but on the related problem of hermeneutics and historical understanding: history here becomes a problem of meaning and interpretation —‘the age already in the past is in fact constituted in every respect as a text ’. This also involves an inquiry into the ways in which the critique of the sign affects historical representation, and the dependence of history on the genetic metaphor and on narrative. Important though these issues are, Derrida's major contribution has been his insistence that history is a metaphysical concept according to which the meaning of history always amounts to the history of meaning. As he himself puts it: From the first texts I published, I have attempted to systematize a deconstructive critique precisely against the authority of meaning, as the transcendental signified or as telos , in other words, history determined in the last analysis as the history of meaning, history in its logocentric, metaphysical, idealist…representation. The Derridean critique of logocentrism necessarily includes the concept of history insofar as it depends on notions of presence and meaning determined as truth. For all its frequent invocation as the ‘concrete’, history must by definition entail a problematic represencing of an absence; Derrida therefore argues that, even in its ‘materialist’ conceptualization, it cannot avoid a certain metaphysics. As early as the 1966 essay ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’, for example, he maintains that his analysis of the paradoxical metaphysics of ‘the centre’ is equally applicable to the historical notions of ‘origin' and ‘end’. History consists of a concept which has always been in complicity with a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words, paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history could be opposed. The thematic of historicity…has always been required by the determination of Being as presence… History has always been  conceived as the movement of a resumption of history, as a detour between two presences. Derrida's deconstruction of the notion of presence by the logics of the ‘always already’ and ‘originary repetition’inevitably conflict with a history constructed in terms of a teleological movement from an origin, which can always be reawakened, towards the self-realization of an idea ‘whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence’. The meaning of such a history will always be determined through appeal to a transcendental signified, whereas a deconstructive analysis will demonstrate the simultaneous effects of the lack of such an authority. More radically still, Derrida works at the limits of any possible philosophy of history, arguing that it is not just that the problems of hermeneutics, specifically of interpretation and language, affect historical understanding, but that what in a broad sense he calls writing, or différance , determines history. At the very opening of Of Grammatology , for example, he sets out the thesis that writing constitutes the condition of emergence for all forms of historicity as such: Historicity itself is tied to the possibility of writing… Before being the object of a history — of a historical science — writing opens the field of history — of historical becoming. ‘Language as the origin of history’: on what basis does Derrida make the startling and radical claim that writing as transcendence constitutes the condition of all historicity? In order to try to elucidate this controversial argument, we can return to the well-known remark in the essay ‘Différance’: if the word ‘history’ did not carry with it the theme of a final repression of difference , we could say that differences alone could be ‘historical, through and through and from the start. Here we revert to the dialectic of the same and the other: as Derrida puts it, ‘that the same…is never the identical, means first that Being is history’. It is only through difference, by which the same becomes other and produces a tissue of differences, that history could ever take place: for if full presence were possible, then there would be no difference, and therefore no time, space — or history. Différance means precisely that you can never get out of— and therefore have no need to get back to — history. It also means that if difference in its sense of non-identity sets up the possibility of history, then difference in its sense of delay means also that it can never be finally concluded, for such deferral will always inhibit closure. It is in this sense that Derrida argues that Husserl's Origin of Geometry sets up ‘the possibility of history as the possibility of language’ whereby ‘difference would be transcendental’: writing, in the general significance which Derrida gives it of a differential marking, must be the condition of any historicity. ‘History as différance then means that history will itself always be subject to the operations of différance , and that différance names the form of its historicity. The same conditions hold for totalization. Derrida argues that though history is given the form of a totality by Hegel, his Aufhebung shows that in order to achieve that totality it must constantly transcend itself in a movement of excess. History is the history of the departures from totality, history as the very movement of transcendence, of the excess over the totality without which no totality would appear as such. History is not the totality transcended by eschatology, metaphysics, or speech. It is transcendence itself. History, in fact, works by exactly the same structure of supplementarity as Derrida charts in Of Grammatology . Here Rousseau himself demonstrates in his oscillating interpretations a history that cannot be linear, nor operate according to a single temporality, disturbing instead, the time of the line or the line of time’: We may perceive here the strange workings of the historical process according to Rousseau. It never varies: beginning with an origin or a centre that divides itself and leaves itself, an historical circle is described, which is degenerative in direction but progressive and compensatory in effect. On the circumference of that circle are new origins for new circles that accelerate the degeneration by annulling the compensatory effects of the preceding circle, and thereby also making its truth and beneficence appear. Such a history cannot be represented by the movement of a linear progression of unfolding time. Its ‘transcendence’ marks the way in which it can similarly never be limited to a finite totality, nor, conversely, to an infinity:. it exceeds itself. This process of supplementation, this ‘overabundance of the signifier’ that always goes beyond itself, is the result of a lack, or absence at the centre or origin, which must always be supplemented. Thus the argument that ‘history’ is what ‘poststructuralism’lacks, itself repeats totalization's own structure of supplementarity according to which history functions both as an excess and a lack in the origin. Insofar as it sets up such a process of necessary and constant supplementation, we could say that the impossibility of totalization produces a writing-effect whose process of perpetual deferral unremittingly provokes more writing. It is thus no longer a question of being able to produce a new concept of history, which, as Derrida puts it, ‘is difficult, if not impossible, to lift from its teleological or eschatological horizon . History cannot be done away with any more than metaphysics: but its conditions of impossibility are also necessarily its conditions of possibility. This means, as Rodolphe Gasché observes, that ‘the mimicry of totality and of the pretension to systematicity is an inseparable element of deconstruction, one of the very conditions of  finding its foothold within the logic being deconstructed’. Derrida himself, therefore, does not in any sense abjure history (or totality) but rather attempts to reinscribe it by writing histories that set up supplementary figures whose logic simultaneously invokes and works against historical totalities. From this perspective, even Sartre's Critique looks rather different from the way it appeared in the early sixties when read in the context of Lukács' History and Class Consciousness . Today it seems to evince a growing recognition that totalization cannot be achieved without a movement involving the transcendence of itself. In Sartre's terms, a totalization needs a totalizer. It must always involve an excess beyond the totality without which the totality could never be totalized, which must mean that it can never in fact be closed. Lyotard points to exactly the same structure in Marx, who could likewise never complete Capital . This endlessness of perpetual deferral, he argues, is later formalized in ‘a tragic political party…the negative dialectic of the Aufklärung ; it is the Frankfurt School, demythologized, Lutheran, nihilistic Marxism’. But instead of the perpetual threat of totalization, a spectre which the Frankfurt School anticipates endlessly, Derrida suggests rather that the problem in any structure is rather how it achieves closure. Even if this appears to have occurred, a deconstructive account will show how such a text had to dissimulate in order to cover over its own openings, or, to put it the other way round, it will show how history must always be organized by an attempted occlusion of its own conditions of historicity. This means that it is not necessary to reject totalization as such — because such a rejection assumes its very possibility, whereas all attempts at totalization such as Sartre's demonstrate rather its impossibility. Peter Dews has recently claimed that ‘post-structuralism can be understood as the point at which the ‘logic of disintegration’ penetrates into the thought which attempts to comprehend it, resulting in a dispersal into a plurality of inconsistent logics’. So poststructuralism is itself the ‘shattered mirror of the logic of disintegration. But poststructuralism precisely does not try to comprehend disintegration, for grasping heterogeneity together is exactly what all totalizing theories have unsuccessfully attempted to do. Having elaborated the paradoxical conditions of historicity, of any history or totalization, Derrida himself has been particularly concerned to analyse those such as Husserl, Heidegger or Levinas, who have been involved in investigations of time and temporality. Although it would be possible to pursue the question of history in terms of such analyses of the forms of historicity, such an enquiry would take us on a very different path from that prompted by our original question, namely if poststructuralism can apparently be faulted by reference to a history which it neglects, where in Marxism can this history be found? Since Sartre and Althusser there have been a number of possibilities: for some, the absolute historicism of the  Frankfurt School has become increasingly attractive, although in its current manifestation in the work of Habermas we might say that history has been eclipsed far more effectively than by any comparable French philosopher. If Althusser gave us history without a subject, Habermas gives us subjects without history. Otherwise there have been two possibilities which effectively continue the lines of descent from Hegelian historicism and the history of science. The most notable representative of the latter has been Michel Foucault, who has remorselessly continued the critique of totalizing forms of history and the disavowal of a general philosophy of history in favour of strategic ‘genealogical’ analyses. The alternative to this has amounted to a reaffirmation of historicism almost as if nothing had happened. This has been the course of Perry Anderson, who after his Althusserian moment has returned to espouse the virtues of empirical historical studies, under the general aegis of a historicism anchored in the recasting of orthodox historical materialism by G.A. Cohen. More influential in the realm of literary and cultural theory has been another overt defence of historicism — that of Fredric Jameson. It is to Foucault and to Jameson that we now turn."
ACA ACA-EA7-001 -0.84 "ARISTOCRATIC LIFE 98–1108 (a) The ruling class: its resources and means of self-aggrandizement (i) Wealth ‘To him that hath shall be given’ was a truism of early medieval society. Because lords owned large tracts of land at a time when the opportunities for its exploitation were particularly favourable, and could add to this profit from tolls and customs on increasing trade, they could hardly avoid a substantial increase in their resources in the course of the eleventh century. But the fly in the ointment, from the princes' point of view, lay in the fact that their advantages were now more widely shared than they had been in the past. And in some cases, most strikingly in Normandy, the landed gains of castellans had been made at the expense of the comital demesne. There was thus a real danger, not of impoverishment, but of the closing of the gap between princes and other lesser lords, just at the time when display and liberality were increasingly important elements in princely political armouries. Renewed effort to enrich themselves was therefore demanded. Prima facie, it seems likely that princes joined with other laymen and ecclesiastics in encouraging the extensive forest clearance that characterized the French countryside; but proof is lacking. The famous letter from the archbishop of Rheims to Baldwin V of Flanders, praising him for his activities in draining and ditching the coastal areas (presumably after the Dunkirk inundation of 1014–42 had at last subsided) is explicit evidence of an interest in agricultural expansion. And the fact that wine-growing developed markedly on lands much visited by the dukes of Burgundy and Aquitaine is perhaps also suggestive of ducal initiative. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the duke of Normandy, who granted out the larger part of the demesne in feudal tenures, or the count of Toulouse, who was slow to consolidate his lands, was a major contributor to agricultural progress. Encouragement of trade was more widespread. Again, the counts of Flanders were in the vanguard, with Robert the Frisian and Robert II offering protection for merchants crossing the county and their peace for the duration of fairs. But at least as important was the provision of coinage suitable for reasonably small deals and sufficiently abundant for merchants to be able to rely on the supply. Here, Normandy was outstanding. As early as the beginning of the century, wealth in the county was reckoned in monetary terms; the implication that coins circulated freely was borne out when the Fécamp treasure was discovered in 1954. But by around 1020, the quality of Norman coins declined markedly as a concomitant to the rapid increase in quantity. Here there may have been a connection between the temporary weakening of ducal control over minting, in the troubles following Richard II's death, and the production of a currency useful for traders. In Aquitaine, too, this connection seems likely, in that silver coins modelled on those of Charles the Bald circulated until the serious financial crisis of 1103, brought on by William IX's crusading expenses; then the silver coin was devalued, followed in 1112 by a further devaluation, which preceded a period of marked economic growth. In Toulouse also, the steadily falling value of comital coins in the second half of the century made them relevant at last to the needs of the merchant classes. There was, of course, nothing disinterested about princely debasement; but in this instance, princely profit was consistent with mercantile gain. Deliberate assistance to economic growth went hand in hand with administrative reform aimed at channelling its profits firmly into princely treasuries. This policy indicated that princes were ceasing to regard their demesnes, those ragbags of rights and scattered pieces of land, chiefly as means of buying support, whether on earth or in heaven, and were viewing them instead as permanent assets, to be cultivated in a more business-like fashion. Ironically the church, which had gained so much from the older cast of mind, was  prominent in propagating the newer outlook. For the monastic reformers Odilo of Cluny and Richard of St Vanne were renowned for their consolidation of monastic demesnes, their determination to ensure that what had once been granted to their houses should remain their inalienable property. Inspired by this objective, other churchmen, both bishops and abbots, appointed officials called prévôts for the task of collecting rents and dues from their estates. Their examples were not lost on princes; Eudes II of Blois employed a prévôt in 1004 (see p. 196). These officials differed from their predecessors as tax- and rent-collectors, the vicarii and viscounts, in that they were rewarded, not with a beneficium , but with a cut from the profits. Initially, the office was often sold to the highest bidder, who would recoup his losses by assiduity in collecting. But later it became hereditary. The job always excited unpopularity, sometimes even danger. Ademar of Chabannes told of the murder of the duke of Aquitaine's prévôt at St Jean d'Angély in 1026, and the destruction of his house by the angry inhabitants of the town. But despite the risks, for a man of ambition and determination the reward was ample; for a prévôté might bridge the gap between the upper peasantry and the lower echelons of the aristocracy. The introduction of these new officials on princely estates was a piecemeal affair. Only in Flanders, where the comital demesne was in any case a large and solid block, was a complete network of prévôtés created before the end of the century. Elsewhere, their appearance depended on favourable opportunity. Some princes did not employ them at all until the second half of the century. And where they were employed, their duties varied from place to place — some fulfilled judicial as well as financial functions, others might even have a military role. But in performing their tasks all both reflected and further promoted the territorialization of power which was so prominent a feature of the eleventh century political scene. Husbanding the demesne proved more difficult (except in Flanders) than appointing new officials to administer it. Huge grants of land to the church became rarer (but so did the chances of resuming what had once been granted); from  the middle of the century, gifts were more likely to be of consuetudines from ecclesiastical lands or of other tolls and dues. But the real losses in princely revenues were to secular lords, by a process of slow attrition. For any moment of weakness in the fortunes of a great house — the minority of William the Conqueror, the early years of Fulk le Réchin — provided the perfect opportunity for castellans to establish their hereditary rights, or to exercise for their own benefit prerogatives which had hitherto brought profit to the princes. The very substantial endowments most princes had accumulated in the ninth and tenth centuries could be curtailed without disaster in the favourable economic climate of the eleventh century. And the assiduity with which Carolingian taxes like the fodrum or the pedagium were revived compensated in some measure. Nevertheless, it must be supposed that there were economic as well as social inducements to the policies of expansion beyond the West Frankish frontiers pursued by the dukes of Normandy, Aquitaine, and even Burgundy, as well as by the counts of Toulouse, Flanders, and for brief periods Blois and Anjou. Plunder proved a useful temporary boost to revenues; the annexation of new lands, with the opportunities for tougher exploitation which conquest brought in its train, could restore to princes their dominant position as by far the richest men within their principalities. (ii) Justice In 1010 Raymond III of the Rouergue died, leaving to Conques abbey, among other gifts, an estate called Pallas in Narbonne. The monastery's right to Pallas was challenged by the Lady Garsinde, wife of Bernard le Velu, who declared that the estate had belonged to her first husband Raymond, from whom count Raymond III had taken it by force. The monks' first attempt to obtain a judgement in their favour proved abortive; a second trial was therefore arranged at Pallas itself. The abbot of Conques travelled there with his knights and vassals, to put his case before the chosen arbitrator, a certain Bernard. Then the Lady Garsinde and Bernard le Velu arrived, accompanied by an even larger following. When each side had pleaded its cause very noisily, the arbitrator  decided in favour of the monks, though the Lady Garsinde was to receive a monetary recompense for abandoning her claims; a concord was to be drawn up. At this point, one of Garsinde's noble followers, unwilling to accept the verdict, arose and demanded that the decision be made not by arbitration but by battle. In the tumult which ensued, the terrified monks made their escape, only to find their way blocked by the same young lord with fifty knights, who threatened them with death. At this juncture, St Foy sent a storm, the aggressive aristocrat was struck by lightning, his terrified armed men ran away, and when the news of divine intervention reached her, the Lady Garsinde abandoned her case. So, at least, is the story presented by Bernard of Angers in the Miracles of St Foy (it is clear, however, from the subsequent narrative that, whatever the short-term effects of the thunderbolt, Garsinde's claims were pursued again later by her husband.) But what is important in the episode is what the narrator takes for granted: that when men of standing disputed, arbitration was hard to arrange, and often immediately unacceptable to the party which felt itself the loser by the judgement, even where monetary compensation was offered to soften the blow. This point was a truism for contemporary princes. In a case which occurred some time between 1037 and 1054, the abbot of Marmoutier complained in Geoffrey Martel's court that a certain Bouchard had seized back a mill which his brother, with Bouchard's consent, had earlier bestowed on the abbey. In the course of the hearing, Bouchard was brought finally to admit that the abbot's complaint was true. But out of pity for Bouchard's poverty, Geoffrey prevailed on the abbot to allow him possession of the mill for the rest of his life. The strictly legal weighing of rights and wrongs played only a subordinate role in the outcome of the case, even where the judge was, in other respects, assertive of his judicial strength (see pp. 187–8). and if Geoffrey chose to conciliate in aristocratic disputes over property, he was forced to the same resort on matters of crime; even powerful princes refrained from tough measures against those supporters essential to their own position. So, though Geoffrey  expressed his anger after the knight Walter had killed one of his kinsmen, he accepted two mills from him as the price of his peace. Likewise Robert the Frisian chose a mixture of mockery and persuasion, rather than judicial force, to bring to heel one of his knights who had injured another in a brawl. Outright condemnation was as rare as condign punishment where the criminal was a man of high social standing; for if the delinquent vassal chose to submit himself to his lord, he had performed an act of self-abasement which, in itself, merited courteous handling. In so far as the system worked — some disputes were settled, some crimes fully atoned for — it did so because it accommodated to the plastic and multifarious notions of justice obtaining within a small group of men, known to each other from youth up, often related by marriage, who had to reckon on continuing to live as neighbours after the case was over. Because arbitration called for personal authority, tact, and understanding, some princes — Hugh of Burgundy, Robert II of Flanders — achieved a high reputation which attracted many disputes to their court. On the other hand, with the expansion of feudal ties, there was a growing expectation that any lord ought to resolve the disputes among his own vassals. As a consequence, even feeble princes like Fulk le Réchin met with requests for judgement. There was, however, a technical difficulty in the path of litigants: because princes' courts were peripatetic, they had to be pursued around the countryside, as Geoffrey le Preuil pursued Fulk le Réchin in 1093; and this fact offered a convenient excuse for those summoned by their lords as defendants in a case. In 1100, Geoffrey of Vendôme assured William IX of Aquitaine that he was trying to answer the summons to the ducal court, but that every time his messenger reached the appointed place, he found William had moved on. This may have been the simple truth; it may, alternatively, have been an instance of the use of delay by an intelligent but reluctant pleader. For the great weakness of feudal jurisdiction lay in its lack of muscle to enforce the appearance of both parties in court. And this weakness was almost automatically exacerbated in some instances by the alternative of episcopal jurisdiction for infringements of  the Peace of God; this created procedural uncertainties in the minds of plaintiffs and judges, to delay yet further the chance of obtaining justice. Only in Normandy were these problems transcended. Jurisdiction over the peasantry operated on markedly more authoritarian principles; as a result, it was both arbitrary and capable of producing solid financial rewards. But most of it had already escaped the princes' grasp in the tenth century; in the course of the eleventh, it passed squarely into the hands of local castellans, who exacted fines and imposed penalties on their peasants with remorseless vigour. Princes derived profit solely from the courts on their own manorial lands or from those areas whose castellans were held in sufficient subordination to render dues to their lords. As the number of these dwindled, princely jurisdiction apparently reached its low point. Yet there were spasmodic and disparate indications of development in the opposite direction. Geoffrey Martel and Raymond of St Gilles both had some — though temporary — success in asserting the superiority of their courts over all others within their principalities. All over the south, men remembered, if they did not yet always act on, the tradition that serious offences, murder, rape, arson, ought to be justiciable in a higher court; by 1091, the Consuetudines et Justicie declared this Carolingian survival to represent the practice in Normandy. In Flanders, the count's peace was becoming a meaningful concept, at fair times at least. It was precedents like these which fired Philip 1 and his young son Louis VI to renewed policing of the royal demesne at the end of the century. Less visibly, but just as significantly, by confirming agreements reached between castellans or advocates and the communities over which they held sway, princes played their part in the evolution of customary law across the whole of West Francia. And that role was not always simply confirmatory. Geoffrey Martel claimed the right to abolish bad customs; William the Conqueror worked towards securing uniformity of custom across the whole duchy. The trail was blazed for more active princely participation in the following century. (iii) Military resources The exact date of the Vendôme charter, in which Count Bouchard gave full details of the military service owed to him from the area of Vendôme, is still controversial; but it is now accepted as an authentic document of the time of Fulk Nerra or Geoffrey Martel. The charter provides evidence of a surprisingly well-worked-out system to ensure castle-guard of the town: in April, May, June, July and August, it was the count's responsibility, though he paid only for the first two months directly out of his own treasury;, the inhabitants of the town produced a tax for the following three. Then the rest of the year was covered, a month at a time, by each of seven vassals, in return for the fiefs they held of the count. Each night, five men were needed, three for the gates and two to move between them, so the responsibility was heavy. The mixture of feudal service (the vassals' obligation) with mercenary forces (the count was reckoning to pay for his share of the duty) is characteristic of the eleventh century. After treating of castle-guard, the charter goes on to specify all the fiefs in the surrounding area, and their military obligations,ost and chevauchée (long and short expeditionary duty). The document presupposes a direct connection between the fully mounted warrior and the fief, which is unusually specific for a period as early as this; it is therefore indicative of well-developed feudal institutions, at least in part of the area under Angevin control. The drawback to feudal service from the count's point of view was its limited duration. The charter does not mention this, and the period may still have been imprecise; but it is not likely to have been above two months at most, which limited its usefulness considerably. As a consequence, feudal contracts in the full sense of the term must have been more important for supplying castle-guard than for campaigning (though it would be pushing the argument too far to deny them any significance in the field). In his conventum with William V, Hugh de Lusignan was entitled chiliarchus , the commander of a thousand. Later it was recorded that the castellan of Amboise's army numbered  200 knights and 1,000 footsoldiers. Though the figures may well be inaccurate, they attest the contemporary impression that even local forces could be very large, at least in time of emergency. How many of the 200 knights should be counted as members of Lisiard of Amboise's household cannot be determined; the number is rather more what one might expect of the household of a great prince. But some of them will have been men who lived permanently within their lord's gates, his closest companions, who, after several years' service, might hope to be rewarded with fiefs. Others may possibly have enjoyed what later came to be described as ‘money-fiefs’, the regular receipt of some tax or source of revenue in return for service. (Tenure of this sort was once regarded as an exclusively late development; but its roots are now thought to have been very old.) Others again may simply have received pay for appearing to help Lisiard in his emergency, a battle with Thibaud of Blois. The large number of foot-soldiers suggests either that they were mercenaries, or that their presence was accounted for by a surviving obligation under the ban . Whichever it was, it argues for a strategy more concerned with battles, with expeditions, with sieges, than with chevauchées to dominate the locality. In this, the lord of Amboise's armed forces provided a pattern for the future. Granted these sizeable forces at local level, the princes' military success on their own territories was dependent on their ability to win active support from their castellans. Supplicius of Amboise's refusal to assist Fulk le Réchin in the field, because Fulk's enemy was Thibaud of Blois to whom Supplicius had also paid homage, proved that the task was not always straightforward.i On the other hand, William the Conqueror was well supported against the royal invasions after 1051. When the campaign planned was one of aggression outside the principality, there were solid grounds for assisting it, in hopes of booty or even territorial gain. And an expedition which combined the prospect of gain with that of notable adventure, such as the forays into Spain or the Norman conquest of England, could rely on widespread support. In these cases, the prince might well be surrounded by vassals  who owed him military service; but they would be present not from obligation but from desire, and they would be accompanied by large numbers whose reason for being there had nothing to do with feudal ties or fidelity. William the Conqueror's host for the invasion of England, with its contingents of Bretons and Flemings, is proof that the military resources of princes could, on some occasions at least, far outrun knights' fees. Troops who fought for pay were little discussed in the sources; but Henry I's insurance policy in the treaty of 1101 — not invoked, as far as we know — cost £500 sterling a year. The treaty shows that money could be a decisive element in warfare. It also provides a glimpse of Flanders as a place where a substantial number of fighters could be expensively equipped and then encouraged to leave the county for long periods. This corner of West Francia, abandoned and defenceless in the late ninth century, had totally changed its character by the beginning of the twelfth. Henry I was only concerned with hiring knights; hiring foot-soldiers was probably commoner. It has been conjectured that the archers and many of the foot-soldiers who fought at Hastings and feature in the Bayeux Tapestry were fighting in return for pay. The growing population, particularly in the towns of Flanders, provided the manpower for conflicts throughout West Francia; in the future, they were to collect an odious reputation for pillaging as they crossed the countryside. Their great unpopularity may have been the consequence of the heavy financial burden they imposed on their employers; their mere existence is proof that money was circulating fast in western Europe; but that they were not always paid implies an economy too immature to support them readily. (b) Feudal ties A notable innovation in the eleventh-century diplomatic vocabulary of the north was the occasional use of the term fevum , a fief. Its late appearance was inexplicable to the older school of historians, which regarded fiefs as characteristic of social organization throughout the ninth to the  thirteenth centuries. Nowadays its appearance constitutes a convincing argument for those who believe that fiefs and vassalage were insignificant in aristocratic society before about the second quarter of the eleventh century. But although the use of the new word probably does imply the growing importance of a hitherto minor institution, it may also reflect an intellectual change, a dawning awareness of the need for greater clarity in the realm of feudal relations. A famous letter written by Fulbert of Chartres to William V of Aquitaine rehearsed the duties of the vassal in terms deliberately chosen to be easily remembered by the warriors to whom it was to be read: Fulbert's application of ideas drawn directly from two ancient manuals of rhetoric, the Ad Herennium and Cicero's De Inventione , to an entirely medieval social institution, is a vivid illustration of the way in which churchmen moulded the ethical perceptions of the military classes. In the letter, Fulbert used the words fidelis and vassus interchangeably; a vassal was one who had sworn fidelity and who enjoyed a fief. But there are signs that not all his contemporaries saw the relationship in such simple terms. Indeed, the cause of Duke William's concern on the matter was his clash with Hugh IV de Lusignan; in the course of this Hugh, embittered by William's failure to keep his word, renounced his oath of fidelity, except in so far as the count's  physical safety and the safety of Poitiers were concerned. His words implied that there were two grades of fidelity: one which obliged a fidelis to promote his lord's interests in all things, and another that simply bound him not to injure him. There was logic in this distinction; for if the duties of a vassal were such as Fulbert defined them, then in fulfilling them the fidelis whose estates were close to those of his lord would have to make many sacrifices, while for one who lived several days' journey away, not making a nuisance of himself would be a relatively painless matter. Differences in perception of feudal obligation were partly a matter of simple distance. Another variant in perspective was that lordship intensified as the social gap between lord and man increased. Yet even with vassals of the same class, there might be differences. Hubert le Hongre, a knight of the Mâconnais, lent his lord the castellan of Uxelles aid and counsel, witnessed his charters, testified for him in lawsuits, acted as hostage for his family, and entered Cluny's clientage when his lord became a monk. His whole life was bound up in this relationship, despite the fact that the fief he received was not large, and that he also possessed allodial lands. On the other hand, though the knights of the count of Vendôme (see p. 230) were heavily burdened with castle-guard and military service, their obligation was clearly defined, and once fulfilled, they were their own masters. As far as can be seen, they were not involved in their lord's personal life. There were, then, at least two models of knightly service. On occasion, the vassalage extorted from a noble might, like that of a knight, emphasize his dependence on his lord. When Herbert of Maine renounced his homage to Geoffrey of Anjou and recognized William the Conqueror as his lord, he received back everything from William ‘just as a knight received it from his lord’. The point being made here was that William claimed superiority over all Herbert's lands; it was no mere personal bond he was enforcing. The same might be inferred of the relationship between Baldwin IV and Baldwin V and the castellans of the comital demesne. Here the counts rubbed in their superiority by appointing prévôts in each castellany to collect comital dues, and by  taking direct homage from the knights of the castle; therefore the castellan could scarcely forget the conditional nature of his tenure. But any weakening, however temporary, in the prince's dominance would serve to produce a more normal relationship. Over West Francia as a whole, the eleventh-century castellans became but loosely subordinated to their princes. If fully independent castellans such as those of Bemy and the Mâconnais remained a rarity, nevertheless the princes' claim to control fortifications was at best spasmodically enforced, at worst absent in practice if recognized in theory. For the concession of hereditary tenure, though made piecemeal over a long period of time, was universal by the end of the century. Only rebellion could deny a castellan his inheritance; then, the punishment might be harsh. In 1070, Fulk le Réchin, not content with disinheritance, pulled down the castle of Tréves, and blinded Hardouin, its lord. But for the most part, later eleventh-century castellans had contrived to convert their homage into little more than a symbol of deference and willingness to perform service; the implications that their castle and office were enjoyed purely by delegation, that their duty lay in exercising powers and privileges only for the benefit of their lord, were swiftly transmuted into something much less rigid; exactly what depended on the prince's powers and proximity. Perhaps ironically, one important factor preventing precision and continuity in princes' demands of their castellans was the intervention of other princes. Royal control over the castellans of the Ile de France was relaxed by Eudes II of Blois, who created his own network of vassals among them; in the same way, the dukes of Aquitaine attracted the lords of Parthenay to their court, though they were Angevin vassals. Although, in the short term, these manoeuvres attained their political objectives, in the end they simply conferred new independence on the castellans. Double allegiance could be a useful weapon, as Supplicius of Amboise had found (see p. 231). In 1090 the lord of Montpellier exploited it even more successfully when he rose against his lord, the bishop of Maguelonne; worried by William's defection, the bishop bribed him back into the  episcopal mouvance by extending his fief. In return, William was required to recognize that, since the fief he held of the bishop was now larger than those any other lord had bestowed on him, he ought to be ‘a better man’ of the bishop than of any of his other lords. To mount the social scale again, the higher the rank of the underdog, the less his obligation would be defined. When the counts of La Marche and Périgueux paid homage to the duke of Aquitaine, it implied acceptance on their part that to injure the duke's person or property would be a breach of faith, but little more; if they came to his court or assisted him on campaigns, it was because they saw profit or pleasure in so doing. A similar relationship obtained between the count of Flanders and the comital family of Boulogne, between the Capetians and the old-established comital families of the Ile de France, between the dukes of Burgundy and the counts of Mâcon, Chalon, and Meaux. At the apex of the pyramid came the princes' homage to the king — at least where they took it (excluding therefore the counts of the far south and of Brittany, and the duke of Normandy after the breach of 1051). Helgaud reported that Robert the Pious secretly removed the relics from the reliquary on which he obliged his primates (magnates) to take oaths, in order to shield them from committing perjury. The tale, if true, showed little confidence in the princes' intention to abide by the exact words of their fidelity. But what was implied by the oath was genuinely in dispute. At the beginning of the century, Dudo of St Quentin produced the argument that, since the homage of Duke Rollo of Normandy in 911 had been purely in gratitude for his baptism, it did not mean, either for himself or for his successors, that Normandy was a fief. Rather Rollo and they had rendered services to none other than to God. A less elevated but similar claim was made by Eudes II in a letter written to King Robert: ‘If it is a question of the nature of the benefice you gave me, the fact is that it does not come from your domain, but from the estates which come to me with your consent by hereditary right from my ancestors.’ In Eudes's eyes, then, he held Champagne hereditarily; it was not subject to the king's decision to grant or not to grant. The  fact that the king thought differently on both these issues was of little moment. On the other hand, William of Poitiers imputed to Guy Geoffrey, Thibaud, and Geoffrey Martel irritation at being obliged to perform military service when summoned — which suggests acceptance of their duty; Orderic's words imply that Fulk the Young clearly recognized the dependent status of Anjou in 1106 when he did homage to Philip I. The differences of opinion on a point that later lawyers were to regard as fundamental to the monarchy's position must be taken as proof that, for the great at least, the equation between a fidelis and a vassus could not yet be taken for granted. Interestingly, there are signs that those who had escaped from the royal mouvance were not entirely comfortable in their independence. In the absence of the king, they sought a higher authentication of their rights. So Raymond of St Gilles, after he had claimed the Rouergue in 1079, prepared himself for his attempt to oust his brother as count of Toulouse, in a ceremony at the shrine of St Robert at La Chaise-Dieu: The adoption of an overlord in heaven lent weight to Raymond's doubtful title in Toulouse, while infringing not at all on his earthly independence. So the patron saint had become absorbed into the feudal world. It was an example that, in rather different circumstances, was later to commend itself to the Capetians. (c) Ruling families As the count of Roucy journeyed to Rome, he fell into a trap laid by Falco, count of Burgundy, who demanded, as the price of his release, his daughter's hand in marriage. The incident shows that force might still play some part in the creation of marriage alliances in the eleventh century. But the swashbuckling approach grew rarer; and with the  disappearance of the Carolingian and Ottonian houses a measure of excitement drained out of the game, for neither Capetian nor Salian brides enjoyed the same cachet as their predecessors. In any case, as a result of the growing emphasis on patrilineal descent in all aristocratic families, even the noblest of wives could do less for an eleventh-century lord than she could have done for his grandfather. The marriage between Robert the Pious's daughter and the count of Nevers brought obvious political gain to the king because it strengthened the royal hold upon Burgundy; the count on the other hand gained only temporary advantage, and subsequent generations in Nevers made little of their royal connection. Behind this change lay a new and more business-like concentration on landed possession. Symbolic of this was the slow decline in the importance of marriage portions conferred by husbands on their new wives, and a correspondingly avid interest in the bride's dowry. Dowries could prove major blessings; that brought by the heiress of Rennes to Hoël of Nantes transformed the otherwise weak count into a major landholder. But if the wife died before her husband, his right to keep the dowry might well be challenged by her family. The war that broke out between Richard II of Normandy and Eudes II of Blois in 1013–14 was over Eudes's right to retain the dowry of his dead wife, Richard's sister. And Raymond of St Gilles attacked the Rouergue immediately on the death of its countess, married to Robert of the Auvergne, rather than allow his family's claims to her lands to be forgotten. Without military strength to assist in their retention, dowries could prove but short-term gains. On the other hand, marriage might still create claims to territory which good luck and force could convert into possession. Although in the end William IX of Aquitaine failed to make good his wife's right of succession to her father in Toulouse, a generation earlier his father Guy Geoffrey had succeeded in annexing Gascony, pleading in justification his father's marriage with the heiress Prisca. And marriage beyond the frontiers of the West Frankish kingdom was seen as a preparatory step towards expansion by the counts of Flanders in their dealings with the  houses of Hainault and Holland, by the ducal houses of Burgundy and Aquitaine in Aragon, Barcelona, and Navarre, and by the count of Toulouse in Provence. (These alliances had the additional advantage of earning ecclesiastical approval at a time when there was growing pressure from canonists against unions within six degrees of relationship.) Because the death-rate was high, marriages were usually short-term; and divorce could be obtained where nature did not intervene. On the other hand, greater prosperity and more settled political conditions combined to make barrenness less common than in the tenth century; Geoffrey Martel of Anjou and Duke Hugh of Burgundy were unusual in producing no heirs. Problems were now far more likely to arise in determining the rights of succession among competing members of a princely family. It has been stated that the principle of primogenital succession was increasingly observed in the eleventh century; but there was a substantial difference between accepting the customary right of the eldest son to succeed, if he were of age and competent, and accepting it as an inviolable rule, as was proved by the usurpation of Robert the Frisian, and perhaps also by the succession of Raymond IV of Toulouse (though here the facts are rather uncertain). And the plight of even generously endowed younger sons like William Rufus and Eon of Penthièvre could arouse sympathy among their contemporaries. Besides, where a prince had contracted more than one marriage, there might be disputes among the offspring of his various wives, as occurred after the death of William V of Aquitaine, and in 1032 in the royal family. On that occasion the energetic opposition to Henry I's accession put up by Constance of Arles and her sons created a serious crisis, in the course of which Henry was driven to take refuge at the court of the duke of Normandy. Though in the end his rights prevailed, the dispute had long repercussions on his control over the counts and castellans of the demesne. So primogeniture was not automatically accepted; and where it was, it could create problems of a rather different sort. Heirs grew over-ambitious: both Baldwin V of Flanders and Geoffrey Martel the Younger rebelled against their fathers in an attempt to establish their own dominion  ahead of time; more problematically, princes had the headache of finding adequate endowments for their younger sons without infringing on the patrimony. But despite its drawbacks, primogeniture did offer a rule of thumb that commanded widespread respect. So the real difficulty remained in families where there was no direct heir, as the Angevin succession crisis of the 1060s proved. Perhaps a mature perception of this fact lay behind the rather surprising acquiescence of most Norman lords in William the Conqueror's succession as duke in 1035, though he was but a child and a bastard. The uniqueness of this step was long remembered. As late as the 1180s, St Hugh of Lincoln dared to tease Henry II of England about the tanner's blood in his veins. (William's mother was thought to have been Herleva, daughter of Fulbert, a tanner of Falaise). William of Poitiers strove to emphasize the nobility of the West Frankish aristocracy, by calling Guy Geoffrey the Emperor Henry III's brother (he was his brother-in-law through the marriage of his sister Agnes), and by ascribing to Baldwin V connections not only with the ruling houses of France and Germany, but also with that of Constantinople (what he had in mind has not yet been established). Nevertheless it seems that the eleventh-century history of princely houses was more mundane, more businesslike, than it had been in the past. Marriage and inheritance were matters for bargaining and negotiation, no longer open to inspired manoeuvres. And it is notable that harmony in succession policy evaded those whose political achievements were otherwise outstanding — Geoffrey Martel, Baldwin V, William the Conqueror. Indeed it might almost be conjectured that those families in which political nous was widely distributed were just those that found the principle of primogeniture unpalatable. (d) Courts The life of the high aristocracy was lived on the move and in the open; tranquillity and privacy evaded them. For a lord's status was directly related to the size of following he could support, and the larger his entourage the more frequently he had to move from estate to estate to feed them. The count  of Flanders was usually accompanied by between fifty and a hundred armed men; the duke of Aquitaine took a hundred knights with him on a visit to the viscount of Ventadour. Besides, there were the animals. Duke Robert of Burgundy expected Gilly, an estate of St Germain-des-Prés, to provide food for his dogs as well as lodging for his horses and their grooms. It was hardly surprising that few places could afford to entertain their lords for weeks on end. On the march, there was little room for ceremonial. When Geoffrey de Preuilly caught up with Fulk le Réchin's men to obtain a hearing for his plea, he found the count sitting on a table, his steward standing before him, his huntsman below, mounted and carrying the count's falcon. The scene suggests a lifestyle familiar to the Franks from their first penetration of Gaul. Just as informally, William the Conqueror once confirmed a grant ‘while sitting on his carpet between the church and the forester's house.’ Dirty, bloodstained, and exhausted lords surrounded by brutal warriors, making their way from primitive wooden castles to austere monastic refuges, must have been common sights on the West Frankish roads. And if, on occasion, they pillaged or, like the following of Eudes of Burgundy, held up caravans of pilgrims and merchants to make a quick profit from their ransoms, few can have been surprised; for it was adventure, self-interest, and companionship that bound knights to their lords. Rarely can St Augustine's dictum that bands of brigands are but petty kingdoms without justice (City of God , iv, 4) have been so easily comprehended as in the eleventh century. There were, however, short breaks from the itinerant routine, when the great festivals of the church provided occasions for large gatherings, rich feasts, fine dress. Princes usually celebrated Easter, Christmas, or Whitsun in cathedral towns or important monastic centres within their territories, giving advance notice of their intention so that other lords might foregather with them. When Robert II of Flanders passed Christmas at St Omer, ‘there came to him the dukes, the counts, the lords of many regions, nobles and knights from the whole of Flanders, and many French bishops’. In such company, the ancient rituals of Christian worship shed  their warm glow of splendour on the court. There might be some ceremony of welcome; there might be special prayers for the ruling family (the genealogies of the counts of Flanders at St Bertin and the counts of Anjou at St Aubin's suggest this). And occasionally the bishop might call for the Laudes regiae , the litany ‘addressed solely and triumphantly to the victorious Christ in his divinity as the eternal king of heaven and earth, and as the exemplar and guarantor of power and prosperity to all potentes who upheld the fabric of a unitary Christian society — pope, king, royal family, clergy, lay magnates and warriors’. This litany served to keep alive in French Christian memory the true place of the king as Christ's representative on earth, at a time when political realities bade fair to obliterate it; but it also elevated the lower ranks of earthly powers. Only the duke of Normandy presumed to make this explicit, allowing his own name to be introduced into the chant after the prayers for the French king, so that the congregation called on the great warrior saints to guarantee the duke's safety and perpetual peace. His arrogance was soon rewarded by a royal position which legitimated it. But the caution of other princes may not have blinded their followers to the possible propaganda value of the Laudes . Beyond the portals of the church, festival days were active ones. Bishops might seize the opportunity to urge support for peace councils, abbots to press for protection, lay lords to obtain charters while plentiful clerical help was available to draw them up and suitably important men present to act as witnesses. With his friends and allies about him, a prince might discuss future strategy, consider marriage alliances, resolve disputes. Far from being rest days, the festivals of the church were times of heightened activity, in an atmosphere redolent of older, grander, more disciplined ways. As the century wore on, the returning prosperity of the countryside brought a markedly higher standard of living in its train for those best able to exploit their opportunities;, the revival of trade facilitated the acquisition of luxuries. Inevitably, princely trains grew to expect more lavish hospitality from the castles and monasteries that they visited. When Robert II of Flanders called at St Thierry with his  sister, widow of Cnut IV of Denmark, the abbot Rudolph cleansed the whole building, hung it with rich hangings and tapestries, filled it with carvings, sculptures, and other precious objects, to turn his simple Benedictine house into a suitable environment for the reception of so magnificent a prince. Though his extravagance was well rewarded, it must have placed a severe strain on the house's finances. Even when living at their own expense, princes had higher expectations. Fécamp, Bruges, Limoges, Chartres, Dijon provided backdrops for displays of occasional grandeur. Because attracting important men to his presence was essential to princely authority, ostentation might offer sound political investment. A prince's entourage provided his closest friends, his most trusted servants, the knights on whom he relied in time of crisis. Throughout the century, these households retained the military character that was at the core of their lord's authority. The household of William the Conqueror was the nerve-centre from which his military victories were planned, from which his duchy and the kingdom of England were held in subordination; its lay members held themselves always ready for battle. The armed following that accompanied Robert the Frisian on his Jerusalem pilgrimage so impressed the Emperor of Byzantium, Alexius Comnenus, with its martial bearing that he requested similar assistance from the west. Although many household knights were men of free rather than noble birth — in Flanders there were even recruits from among the unfree, like the German ministeriales — the prince's relatives and the sons of his neighbouring lords also found careers within their ranks. So in the long term, the entourages of the great proved effective as social melting-pots. Yet as the century wore on, their military character ceased to be the exclusive distinguishing feature of princely households. When the countess Adela of Blois issued an important charter, it was noted that she was surrounded by her capellanus and her clerici, barones, milites et servientes . her chaplain and her clerks, barons, knights, and servants. The household chaplain, whose role it was to minister to the spiritual needs of princely families, could also produce letters, such as those written for Stephen of Blois to his wife  Adela while he was on the First Crusade; or charters, like those produced for the post-Conquest dukes of Normandy. In Normandy, indeed, their importance grew so great that they began to be promoted to bishoprics after about 1060, a move reminiscent of Ottonian and Salian practice. William of Poitiers, William the Conqueror's most learned and literate biographer, had been his master's chaplain for some years; in the future, household chaplains were regularly to combine the roles of secretary, teacher, and propagandist for princes, as he had done. The mixture of usefulness and display that explained the growing importance of the chaplains also lay behind the rise of other household officers. With growing princely income and expenditure, the charge of the purse became more responsible; chamberlains appeared everywhere — in Flanders as early as the tenth century — to control it. Then large households required butlers and stewards to satisfy their material needs, marshals for ceremonial. Someone must always have discharged these duties; but the mention of these officials in eleventh-century households pointed to two developments: firstly, a conscious imitation of Carolingian ways (for Charlemagne and his heirs had surrounded themselves with seneschals and stewards), and secondly, a revived interest in administration. It is perhaps characteristic that the best evidence for the appointment of household officers in the first half of the eleventh century should come from Normandy, which combined reverence for the Carolingian past with respect for efficiency to a degree unparalleled elsewhere. By the second half of the century, the practice was spreading. In Flanders, in Champagne, in Anjou, on the royal demesne, chamberlains, butlers, stewards, marshals made their appearance. Because their duties involved close co-operation with the prince, their holders were usually men of high social status, the prince's more intimate friends among his following. In ceremonial, their role was everywhere prominent; interestingly, some household officials were beginning to discharge governmental functions, as in Normandy. But their commonest duty was to act as witnesses in charters;, by the last two decades of the century, the royal household officials were excluding other lords from this task. Along with the knights, the chaplains, and the officials, there travelled the ladies of the court with their servants, and a sizeable contingent of young boys. Of these, some were present involuntarily, as hostages for their father's good behaviour — Supplicius of Amboise, for example, had to put his son Hugh in Fulk le Réchin's power as one of the terms of a peace treaty; but others were the sons of friends or allies, sent to the prince's court for the sake of education in knightly virtues, and to meet the men on whom their future political happiness could depend. Princely households had common characteristics with the English public schools of past generations. And though they too set social connection and sporting activities — hunting, combat, riding — above literacy, nevertheless it was possible to acquire learning at them; the opportunities exploited by William V of Aquitaine, William the Conqueror, Robert the Frisian, and Fulk le Réchin — all regarded as educated men — must have also been available to some of those who were brought up with them. So eleventh-century courts were centres for ceremony, business, education; Charlemagne would have sympathized with all of these. He would have understood, too, the presence at Norman and Angevin courts of clerks whose function it was to extol the deeds of their princes. But, despite Einhard's assertion that he loved barbarian poems, he would surely have been disconcerted by the evolution of the Poitevin court under William IX as a centre of troubadour poetry, its prince as the most distinguished poet of all. And he might well have dismissed the Flemish court, with its prince who hedged and ditched, its chancellor who audited accounts, as mercenary. What must have surprised him, as it still surprises us, was the sheer variety of court life, its different rhythms, its stately ceremonial in buildings still primitive both by Carolingian and later standards, and the unique character bestowed on each court by the personality of its prince."
ACA ACA-ECV-002 -0.93 "2 On Not Being Afraid of Natural Sex Differences Mary Midgley THE LURE OF THE UNIVERSAL The long-standing philosophical controversy into which this topic most obviously fits is the political one about equality. It concerns the degree to which human beings are standardised items. How far are we all essentially the same? My main point will be that this is not a simple, package-deal question. There are angles from which it is important to emphasise similarities, and others from which — for equally strong moral reasons — it is important to emphasise differences. In the last century or two, the similarities have had more emphasis from philosophers. This has happened partly for good political reasons because there was need to demand a more equal society. But it has also happened for formal reasons which are not good ones at all. There is a notion that philosophy ought only to deal with matters which are absolutely universal. Now it is true that all very wide questions have a philosophical aspect. Philosophy, therefore, often does deal with these questions. But this does not mean that it is fitted only to be used on matters at the extreme end of the spectrum of abstraction — that it can, for instance, discuss people only in so far as they are rational beings, or sets of behaviour-patterns, or immortal souls. Philosophy deals with conceptual difficulties, and these arise in the working out of quite detailed and specific ideas, as well as of wider ones. Indeed, since we actually live in particular contexts and often have difficulty in understanding them, many of our mistakes arise at that level, before more abstract speculation begins at all. The hasty flight to apparently universal rules often gives philosophical notions only a specious air of universality. It is notorious that ambitious ideas claiming to mirror the whole human condition have often turned out to describe  chiefly the condition of the group doing the theorising. When a different set of people takes up the questions, this becomes obvious. Of course, errors of this kind will always be made. We cannot jump off our own shadows. But after so many of these experiences, we ought to be becoming increasingly aware of the danger. Though we cannot look at things from all points of view at once, we can at least learn not to pretend that we are doing so. We speak with relative confidence about our own group. But to see what limitations this brings, we absolutely need to have a more lively sense of its differences from at least the groups which neighbour it. A gradient of dissimilarity leads away from each of us. Yet in spite of this, we all need to communicate and to get some general understanding of each other and of the world we live in. Total scepticism about this project is not an option for us. We therefore continually try to correct one philosophical perspective about it against another. Among these corrections, feminist ones have by now resoundingly made good their place. Earlier generations had already noticed the odd consequences which followed from Aristotle's having seen the human condition as unquestionably that of an Athenian gentleman, and Kant's having seen it as that of a Prussian bourgeois. But until lately very few people had managed to make themselves heard when they pointed out the dramatic effect of all previous philosophers having seen it as that of a man — that is, of course , not an exact reflection of what men are like, but an image of how they tend to see themselves when they contrast themselves with women. How much does this particular limitation matter? Till lately, respectable intellectual opinion has held that it hardly mattered at all. From the ancient hierarchical point of view (unchanged from Aristotle to Kant and beyond) it could not matter because women themselves did not really matter. They were in effect an inferior kind of man, with no distinctive character of their own. They thus shared in the human condition to the extent that inferior men did, and needed no special comment. On the other hand, those who abandoned the hierarchical position and held, not only that all men were equal but that all people were so, lost interest in sex differences for the opposite reason. For them, women were as good as men because they were no different from men. They were effectively men but no longer inferior ones. The move is that which Aristotle or Kant would have made if they had promoted all outsiders (such as women and non-European peoples) to the status of honorary Athenian or Prussian men. Now from certain points of view — mainly political ones — this is an admirable move. For the purpose of asking whether a given set of people may be enslaved, or deprived of their property, or denied access to the law courts, or the like, decency is best served by remembering that these are beings as conscious and valuable as ourselves, sharing our vulnerabilities and sensibilities. So we call them equal. But there is a whole range of other situations where the opposite move is needed, where we need to stress that people can differ from us, for instance over proposals to give all children the same kind of education or to make everybody live in the same kind of house. Notoriously, long and gruelling work is needed to make the notion of political equality fit both these kinds of demand. To date, feminism has contributed a good deal of fuel to both sides of this dialectic, because the case of women is a peculiar one, and introduces even more complications into an already troublesome argument. The main need, however, is to bring the two sides somehow together, since all of us at one time or another need help from both of them. I think feminists have not seen this need clearly enough. They have been too ready to use one or other of the clashing theses as occasion served, without troubling to bring them into intelligible relation. This has happened naturally enough, because it reflects the habits of those with whom they were disputing. Reformers attacking the subordinate status of women have naturally appealed to the idea of equality, because it was already recognised as a proper and powerful tool of reform. But in other situations — for instance in asserting a mother's special right not to be deprived of her children, or in offering characteristically female insights to correct a narrowly male view of life — they have equally naturally appealed to the idea of a distinct female nature. Quite sharp conflicts continually develop between these two approaches, and will continue to do so until their relation is thought out properly. Is all difference eventually to be abolished? Should the dialectic process ideally lead to a simple merging, so that the views of men and women on any matter will normally be indistinguishable? Or is the position more like that of the interaction between two separate cultures — or indeed two individuals — where each can indeed gain a great deal from the other, but will always retain its own distinct identity? AUTONOMY, SOLITUDE AND EGOISM An interesting and crucial example of this difficulty concerns the ‘social atomism’ typical of Enlightenment thinking. This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, than an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties. This unit can become bound to others only by his own free choice, and his choice is rational only in so far as he can safely expect it to serve his own interests. The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description. If ‘she’ is substituted, the ludicrous unreality of the picture at once becomes plain. The great Social-Contract theorists of the Enlightenment therefore explicitly excluded women from their systems. Each woman remained attached to some male contractor, according to the older organic and hierarchical pattern.’ The resulting brand of individualism thus contains a radical anomaly, affecting half of those present — an anomaly which, however, does not seem to have been visible until light was specially directed on to it by feminists. (This little bit of extra enlightenment is a key move in the creation of modern feminism.) There are two possible ways of curing the anomaly. One is to go the whole atomist hog and turn women too into full-time contracting egoists, no less exploitative and solitary than the males. Rousseau (1755), in his early accounts of the state of nature, attempted this heroic move, and he has recently been echoed from the feminist side by Shulamith Firestone in The Dialectic of Sex (1971). As a response to the brutal competitive individualism which is fashionable today, this proposal is understandable. If the rest of us cannot beat the gangsters, we may well be tempted to join them. But efforts to work out this atomistic society in detail are not very plausible. In particular, the situation of children both in Rousseau's world and in Shulamith Firestone's is a more or less impossible one. This is not just a matter of children's physical dependence; it concerns the emotional constitution of human beings generally. The asocial attitude which these pictures call for is not one normal to human beings of either sex. The only situation in which it tends to look so is the transient one of adolescents leaving home and protesting against their parents. Even Nietzsche expected his future Supermen to form a community. Why then has the atomistic image been so powerful? Why has it been extended so far beyond the large-scale political contexts where it was needed, to permeate  modern ideas about choice and freedom? Why, when we all know that loneliness is a paralysing form of human misery, do we go on as if we thought that the deepest need of rational individuals was to be independent of one another? Traditional thinking answered these questions by saying simply that such was the true nature of man. And it often explicitly contrasted that nature with that of woman. It is no accident that both the Greek and Latin words for ‘virtue’ originally meant ‘maleness’. Much morality, and thereby much metaphysics, has been distorted by serving a polemical purpose in a clash of ideals seen as dividing the two sexes. Theorists have constantly and explicitly used antitheses such as active/passive, reason/emotion, form/matter, mind body, autonomy/dependence as weapons in this supposed war, recommending their own ideals by directly claiming that the contrary ones were typical of women. The call to ‘be a man’ has regularly been seen as a self-explanatory moral exhortation. In this way, grossly oversimple notions about sex differences have affected philosophy far beyond the obvious context of egalitarian theory from which we started. False claims to universality have been used to cover a persistent warping in our notions of what it is to be an individual. Once we have seen it, can we get rid of this distortion quite easily? We can certainly make some progress towards doing so by peeling away the gender-drama from the conflicts of ideals in which it has often figured, and trying to see those conflicts in sex-neutral terms. Freedom, we now notice, is not always a higher ideal than those with which it competes, nor is rationality necessarily just a matter of self-interest. Certain social bonds are essential for the highest activities that we are capable of, so that the antithesis ‘bond or free’ was always a tendentious one. And so on. Can we then go on from there to a new unbiased universality? Have we reached down to the true bedrock of human life, at which sex differences are revealed as artificial and insignificant, so that we no longer need a tribal division? On this point, feminist thinking is — as I have mentioned — highly ambivalent. The egalitarian strand of it says yes, and dismisses all suggestions of genuine, irreducible sex differences as ‘sexist’. Another and at least equally powerful strand says no, because it wants to emphasise the distinctive value of women's insights, and also the special bond of sisterhood which is seen as binding women together, rather than letting them be absorbed and assimilated into  he wider human group. For both these purposes, it is inconvenient to regard the existing distinctive qualities of women — whatever these may be — as simply deformations produced by oppression, which could be expected to evaporate when that artificial pressure is removed. Those who stress sisterhood rather than equality value a great deal in women's distinctive approach as it now is (and has been in societies much less egalitarian than ours) and do not want it lost in the melting-pot of assimilation. Deeper thinking can no doubt resolve this clash. But until it does, constant confusion arises from trying to combine the two approaches. This (again) is not just a problem for feminism. It indicates much wider unfinished business in our long task of digesting Enlightenment ideas — of working out the proper relations between such large concepts as nature, freedom, equality, justice, individuality and the human affections. By ceasing to ignore the awkward case of women — as most of the traditional theorists did we can often see what has gone wrong with our thinking in other, apparently more straightforward cases. THE USELESSNESS OF STANDARDISING One point which should help us to start here is already familiar from existing discussions of equality. Political equality does not call for standardisation. Political equals do not have to be indistinguishable in any respect. They do not even have to be alike at all beyond some minimum range of conditions which puts them into the same political category. This range varies for different purposes, but the aim is always to make it as wide as possible. Thus, for basic civic rights like not being enslaved or imprisoned without trial, people should need only to be people. For slightly more demanding purposes like voting or serving on juries, they need also some minimum level of maturity and sanity, because here their actions affect the interests of others, so they need to understand what they are doing. For more demanding purposes still more is required, and it is often hard to decide just where to fix the borderline. But what the ideal of equality never demands is likeness in any respect above this minimum. In spite of its quantitative sound, political equality never means having an equal amount of any chosen characteristic. It does indeed enshrine a quantitative metaphor, because it exists to counter an older picture which used one. This was the archaic  picture of a king ten times as large as a noble, a noble ten times as large as a merchant — and so on down to the almost imperceptible peasant woman. Against this notion, the reformers contended that, in Bentham's words, ‘each should count for one and nobody for more than one’. But there does not seem to be any useful way of developing this idea by seeing people as containing equal quantities of any special substance, or equal degrees of any property. Imaginatively, however, negative moves of this kind have to be completed by devising new pictures to replace the old ones. To replace hierarchal pictures, the Enlightenment used many such images, and they often did tend to suggest some deeper kind of standardisation as the basis of equality. Thus when Burns wrote: The rank is but the guinea stamp, The man's the gold for a' that he vigorously used an ancient notion of personal worth as resting in an original standard substance, and variation as introduced by society. How ancient this thought is we can see by noticing that it is just the figure Plato used in The Republic to supply his political myth justifying political inequality (Bk. III, 414–15). The hereditary caste of Guardians must (Plato says) be believed to be originally golden while the other castes are of various baser metals, and the various metals ought not to be mixed together. Therefore — except for an occasional mutated child which turns out to be plainly of the wrong metal for its caste — ranks must remain separate. Burns triumphantly hijacks this image by extending the golden substance to the borders of manhood —‘a man's a man for a’ that', so that one could properly ask for ‘one man, one vote’. Women, however, were still perceived as being made of a different metal and, in spite of Mill, their voting remained an absurd and scandalous project for many decades after ‘manhood suffrage’ became a reality. And indeed the otherwise democratic Swiss are still of Burns's mind in this matter; their women do not vote. People who are denied political privileges like this on the ground that they are not standard items naturally tend to reply that the charge is false — to claim that they are actually just as standard as everybody else. When political conflicts rage, it is far harder to take on the awkward task of asking why this particular standard was set up in the first place. In class warfare, for instance, oppressed people easily find themselves claiming to be just as noble or gentlemanly as  their supposed betters, without properly criticising existing ideas of nobility or gentility. (Burns avoided this move, which is what gives his protest its particular dignity. ) Aspiring castes can easily be led in this way to inherit actual faults from their predecessors. More subtly and widely, they can be led to waste effort in imitating traits which had a point in the situations which gave rise to them, but become empty and even harmful when transplanted. The Victorian middle class seems to have become entangled in a good deal of bad faith of this kind by its attempts to imitate an aristocratic life which it did not fully understand. The pursuit of standardisation — the failure to value a difference — here goes beyond a mere passing mistake and becomes actively pernicious. There will be similar trouble over the gender difference if indeed as I am suggesting — it is true that ideas about the meaning of maleness have distorted moral thinking in our culture quite deeply, so as to affect the whole concept of individuality, and thereby condition the way in which some central metaphysical issues are seen. (If this is right at all, it is, of course , right to some extent for other cultures too, but that must be left aside for now.) If, therefore, women want to storm the citadel and share its existing treasures, they have to decide what to do about these autonomy-centred ways of thinking. Are they satisfactory, genuinely universal conceptual systems, which everybody in the new, gender-free intellectual cosmos can use with perfect comfort? Or are they biased, faulty and badly in need of revision? The first option is Shulamith Firestone's. It is, I think, the logical conclusion of the line in Enlightenment thought which has run from Rousseau through Nietzsche and Sartre — the strand of truly anarchic individualist thinking which avoids the vulgar Nozickian ‘libertarian’ path of concentrating on the freedom of certain selected institutions such as commercial companies, and genuinely exalts only the freedom of the individual. Anyone who finds that this entire detachment from personal ties really is their highest ideal will be happy with this kind of utopia. Shulamith Firestone undoubtedly did everyone a great service by vigorously extending this notion to women, and pointing out the absurdity of men's viewing themselves as totally detached individuals in relation to the rest of society, while still expecting to go home to a wife who would always have their dinner hot for them in the evening. But once this absurdity is made clear, many of us today will probably find that extreme individualism, when thus exposed in its full aridity, is not a  heritage that we want to claim. And that leaves us with the second alternative. We have to do the more general piece of work involved in clearing one more bias from our morality. We have to look at the range of ideals which are somehow clustered together to guide us, arrayed as they are in some sort of a rough priority system, and take out of its slot the unquestioned ideal ‘be a man’. We must examine it to see what sense it can yield us in the case of those who, as it happens, are not men in the first place, and in what way, once this is done, it will have changed its meaning for those who, by no special fault or merit of their own, actually are so. DIFFERENCE IS NOT INFERIORITY As the title of this paper shows, I am sure that we cannot hope to do this rethinking while still clinging to the currently orthodox view that there are no natural, genetically determined sex differences. This orthodox view does not really rest on factual evidence, though such evidence is sometimes brought in to back it. (There is no hypothesis which cannot find some facts to support it.) It is held because people believe the acceptance of natural sex differences to be dangerous. The danger has been a real one, but it has flowed entirely from distorted views about what the differences are, not from acceptance of difference as such. Different does not mean worse or better, it means different. And in fact the greater the difference is, the less easy does it become to dismiss one of the differing parties as a mere inadequate version of the other. This is clearly enough seen in the case of differing individuals, and also in that of differing cultures. And the case of the sexes is on the same footing. The main reason why difference is harmless has already been mentioned. Equality does not mean standardisation. One can be ‘as good as’ somebody else in all kinds of ways while still being very different from them. This may sound obvious, but it is extremely hard to remember. Life is constantly astonishing us by confronting us with new kinds of character, and thereby with different kinds of goodness. Thus Anne Elliott in Persuasion,astonished at her friend Mrs Smith's cheerful acceptance of misfortune and hardship, watched — observed — reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude and resignation only. — A submissive  spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from Nature alone. It was the choicest gift of Heaven. (Persuasion vol. 2, ch. 5) Failure to be ready for this kind of thing is the main cause of our dismissing whole squadrons of our fellow-creatures as uninteresting or inferior. This was Aristotle's mistake over women. Judging them by the standard which he used for men, in a society where their roles were totally different, he naturally did not think much of them. So far, what I say may not sound too shocking. Moral pluralism, the notion that there are different kinds of goodness, is quite acceptable to modern thought. What worries people is the idea that these differences, however valuable, are in any way naturally determined and therefore out of the control of the individual. In the case of personal differences, how much does that matter? It is true that I cannot become you, you cannot become me and Blake could not be Beethoven. But this is not an infringement of our freedom. As theologians have noticed, it is not clear that even God could become somebody other than himself. The power to become absolutely anybody goes beyond any normal notion of omnipotence; why should it be a necessary part of freedom? The idea of freedom which lies behind this kind of demand is confused in the same way as the idea of equality which calls for standardisation. Both universalise prematurely, hardening and expanding one aspect of the moral situation to cover ground that goes far beyond its relevance. Does this point lose its edge if we think of the differences as socially rather than naturally produced? This too is a strange idea. Of course, it is true that much of the individuality which people show has been the result of their upbringing. Nobody who brings forward biological causes supposes that they replace social causes. They merely supplement them, as the original qualities of food supplement the effects of cooking in accounting for the properties of the finished dish. But this fact cannot save the inflated concept of freedom just mentioned, because people's upbringing is normally just as far out of their control as their genetic constitution is. What is called ‘biological determinism’ is not more of an attack on freedom than the social determinism (or economic determinism) which is  accepted without moral qualms throughout the social sciences. What is injurious is not determinism but fatalism — that is, the pretence that bad things which are in fact within our control lie outside it and are incurable. On any view of causes, a great deal in the life of each of us is completely out of our power, and our freedom must consist in the way we handle that small but crucial area which does actually come before us for choice. This situation is far more benign than people obsessed with freedom make it sound, because what comes to us by no choice of our own is a gift — a whole world which we could not possibly have made and at which, in spite of all its horrors, we can on the whole only bow our heads in wonder. Moralists able only to think of autonomy, of the active imposition of the will on what is round us, miss the essential values of receptivity, of contemplation, of openness to the splendours of what is not oneself. Our inheritance, both social and natural, is not a shocking intrusion on our privacy and freedom, but a realm for us to live in. Morally speaking, one of the worst aspects of the autonomy-centred Enlightenment attitude has been to denigrate the receptive virtues, to make us so obsessed with giving that we do not know how to receive. As usual, one of these aspects of life does not make much sense without the other. About individual differences, much of what I am saying here may not sound too bad, but many people will want to treat sex differences quite otherwise. Here, the history of the various disputes has been important. Modern educational theory has strongly promoted the idea that individual differences are intrinsic and must not be ironed out. We have been told for several centuries now that every child is naturally different and it is therefore wrong to impose on one the mould which has been prepared for others unlike it. This important thought has been constantly at odds with the equally influential notion that we are all blank paper at birth, ready to be entirely formed by our society. This last wild exaggeration has also been popular with educators at times when they wanted to stress the importance of their task and the need to get it right. But the quite opposed notion of innate individuality has also maintained its strength, no doubt because there is so much in the experience of anybody who actually works with children to support it. If the little creatures were really blank paper at birth, nobody would ever have the slightest difficulty in writing on them whatever their particular culture required, and it would be  impossible for them ever to surprise their elders by unexpected conduct. This is so far from the truth that on the whole, for those really attending to education, the notion of innate given individuality has remained the stronger. Sex differences, however, have been put into a different box. By bad luck, the question of women's emancipation has been most often seen as parallel to that of non-European races. And race difference is, among all the differences which have been used to justify oppression, probably the most trivial. Where it does not coincide with cultural frontiers, it is insignificant. In this case, therefore, Burns's idea of treating differences of status built on it as idle and artificial is just as appropriate as it is in the case of class. It cannot follow, however, that this is true of all other differences. Burns's image of the gold is, we should notice, bound to the Blank Paper theory of human difference. Gold can be made into all sorts of other things besides guineas. Is the gingerbread which is currently stamped into men equally capable of being stamped into standard unisex persons? If we are tempted to assume so, it may be worth while looking at yet another parallel to balance the highly peculiar one of race. How about age? This certainly has a biological basis as well as a social one. The physiological states of growing organisms including human beings — vary greatly from one stage to another. Typical behaviour patterns also change. Play, sleep, sexual behaviour and other proceedings are differently distributed typically — at different ages, in a way that broadly holds across cultural barriers. What reason would there be to deny the obvious causal connections with changing physique? ‘Ageism’ is objectionable, not because it means admitting these connections, but because it means treating old people — or children — badly. There is nothing fishy about simply admitting the reality of the difference, or that of the physical causes which — alongside cultural ones — help to produce it. To insist on denying the reality of such causes is to draw a bizarrely hard line between the physical and the mental aspects of a human being — a line which does seem sometimes to be drawn in the social sciences, and may prove handy in academic feuds between them and biology, but which seems very badly suited to the realistic description of our lives. I have carefully said nothing here about the details of particular natural sex differences. The general point about the innocuousness of natural difference as such needs to be grasped on its own. Once seen, it gives us back a legitimate access to a great wealth of  traditional human experience on the matter, which must of course be critically used, but which certainly does not leave us utterly puzzled, as we might be in starting to observe a strange species. Feminists have already made good use of this tradition. I think, however, that their use of it is still often confused and inhibited by mistaken ideas about what equality demands, and that the senseless ideal of standardisation still produces a waste of effort on this topic, as on many others. This is the sort of muddle which often causes good ideas to run out into the sand. I particularly do not want this to happen to feminism; hence my choice of subject for this essay."
ACA ACA-ECV-006 -0.78 "6 Autonomy and Identity in Feminist Thinking Jean Grimshaw Issues about women's autonomy have been central to feminist thinking and action. Women have so often been in situations of powerlessness and dependence that any system of belief or programme of action that could count as ‘feminist’ must in some way see this as a central concern. But what is meant by ‘autonomy’ and under what conditions is it possible? This has been an important and contentious question in philosophy. But questions about autonomy, and related questions about self and identity have also been important to feminism, and within feminist thinking it is possible to find radically different ways of thinking about these things. In this paper, I want to look at one kind of way in which some feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be ‘autonomous’, and at the implications this has for ways of thinking about the human self. I shall argue that this conception is not only philosophically problematic, but also has an implicit politics which is potentially damaging. And I shall try to suggest some ways of beginning to think about ‘autonomy’ which seem to me to be more fruitful and adequate, and to draw on different traditions of thinking about the self which have become influential in some recent feminist thinking. Feminist thinking does not, of course, exist in a vacuum, and in thinking about women's autonomy, feminists have drawn on different (and conflicting) approaches to questions about the human self, some of which have a long history. I want to begin by going back to an argument that Aristotle put forward in the Ethics , since I think that the point at which his argument breaks down can illuminate the nature of the problem some feminist thinking has faced. Aristotle's argument concerns the question of what it is that makes an action ‘voluntary’, done of a person's own free will, and  in order to answer this question, he distinguished between actions whose origin was ‘inside’ a person, and those whose origin was ‘outside’, which resulted from external influences or pressure or compulsion. He discussed at some length the problems that arise over trying to define ideas such as‘compulsion’, and in estimating the degree of severity of pressure that could make an action not voluntary. But in this sort of model of autonomy, what defines an action as autonomous is seen as its point of origin ; it must have an ‘immaculate conception’, as it were, from within the self. Now ultimately I think that it is this definition of ‘autonomy’ in terms of origin, and the associated distinction between an ‘inner’self which can in some way spontaneously generate its ‘own’actions, and ‘external’influences which are not ‘part’of the self, that will need challenging. But I think it is possible to defend the Aristotelian version of autonomy up to a point, provided notions of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’the self are defined in a certain way. If a person is prevented from doing what they would otherwise intend or desire to do, or if they are coerced into doing what they would not otherwise want or desire to do, they are not acting autonomously. Under this interpretation, actions which originate from ‘inside’ the self are those which are seen as in accordance with conscious desires or intentions, and those which originate from ‘outside’the self are those which one would not do if one were not coerced. The pressure here is to consider the sorts of circumstances which do, in fact, coerce people in these sorts of ways. And, of course, a central concern of feminism has been to identify and fight against the kinds of coercion to which women have been subjected, including things like physical violence and economic dependence. But it is at this point that an Aristotelian-type argument fails to be able to deal with the most difficult questions about autonomy. The Aristotelian view, as I have interpreted it, ‘works’ only to the extent that it is assumed that there is no problem about what I shall call ‘the autonomy of desires’. Autonomy is defined as acting in accordance with desire (or intention). But what of the desires themselves? Are there desires (or intentions) which are not ‘autonomous’, which do not originate from ‘within’ the self, which are not authentic, not really ‘one's own’? Feminist writers have wanted, of course, to indict the various forms of brutality and coercion from which women have suffered. But this brutality and coercion has been seen not merely as a question of physical or ‘external’ coercion or constraint; the force of  subjection has also been seen as a psychic one, invading women's very selves. The language of ‘conditioning’, ‘brainwashing’, ‘indoctrination’, and so forth, has been used to describe this force. The female self, under male domination, is riddled through and through with false or conditioned desires. But set against this conditioned, non-autonomous female self are various images of a female self that would be authentic, that would transcend or shatter this conditioning. I want now to look at some of these images of the female self in feminist discourse: my particular examples are from the work of Mary Daly, Marilyn Frye and Kate Millett. Daly, Frye and Millett all stress the way in which women have been subject to the power of men. Much of Daly's book,Gyn/Ecology (1979), is an account of the barbarities inflicted on women such as suttee, clitorectomy, foot-binding and other forms of mutilation. Millett, in Sexual Politics (1977), sees patriarchal power as something so historically all-embracing that it has totally dominated women's lives. Frye, in The Politics of Reality (1983), uses the situation of a young girl sold into sexual slavery and then systematically brutalised and brainwashed into a life of service to her captors as an analogy for the situation of all women. And all three writers stress the way in which they see the female self as ‘invaded’ by patriarchal conditioning. Millett writes: When, in any group of persons, the ego is subjected to such invidious versions of itself through social beliefs, ideology and tradition, the effect is bound to be pernicious. This should make it no very special cause for surprise that women develop group characteristics common to those who suffer minority status and a marginal existence. (Millett, 1977, p. 55) Women, she argues, are deprived of all but the most trivial sources of dignity or self-respect. In her discussion of Lawrence's depiction of Connie in Lady Chatterley's Lover , what she sees Connie as relinquishing is ‘self, ego, will, individuality’(p. 243); all those things which, Millett argues, women had but recently achieved,(and for which Lawrence had a profound distaste). Mary Daly's picture of the way in which women's selves are invaded by patriarchal conditioning is even more striking. She describes women, for example, as ‘moronised’, ‘robotised’, ‘lobotomised’, as ‘the puppets of Papa’. At times she seems to see women as so ‘brainwashed’ that they are scarcely human; thus she  describes them as ‘fembots’, even as ‘mutants’. In Millett, Daly and Frye, women are seen primarily as victims : the monolithic brutality and psychological pressures of male power have reduced women almost to the state of being ‘non-persons’. And indeed, as Daly sees women as having become ‘mutants’ or ‘fembots’, so Millett sees them as not having been allowed to participate in fully ‘human’activities (which she characterises as those that are most remote from the biological contingencies of life), and Frye sees them as simply ‘broken’and then ‘remade’in the way that suits their masters. But behind this victimised female self, whose actions and desires are assumed to be not truly ‘her own’, since they derive from processes of force, conditioning or psychological manipulation, there is seen to be an authentic female self, whose recovery or discovery it is one of the aims of feminism to achieve. The spatial metaphor implicit in the word ‘behind’ is not accidental, since this model of self is premised on the possibility of making a distinction between an ‘inner’and an ‘outer’self. Ibsen's Peer Gynt compared his quest for identity to the process of peeling layers off an onion; but after shedding all the ‘false selves’, he found that there was nothing inside, no ‘core’. The sort of spatial metaphor implicit in Peer Gynt's account of himself is also apt in the accounts of self given by Daly, Millett and Frye, except that there is assumed to be a ‘core’. This is clearest in the work of Daly. In GynlEcology , discovering or recovering one's own self is seen as akin to a process of salvation or religious rebirth, and Daly writes of what she calls the unveiling or unwinding of the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy to reveal the authentic female Spirit-Self underneath. And this Self is seen as a unitary and harmonious one. Splits and barriers within the psyche, she argues, as well as those between Selves, are the result of patriarchal conditioning. In the unitary and harmonious female Spirit-Self there will be no such splits. Millett's picture of the authentic female self is rather different from that of Daly. It does not draw, as Daly's does, on religious metaphors of salvation and rebirth. It derives, rather, from a picture of the self as fundamentally a unitary, conscious and rational thing, a picture which, in Western philosophy, can be traced back to Descartes. It emerges most clearly in her discussion of Freud. She describes Freud's theory of the Unconscious as a major contribution to human understanding, but her account of the self owes, in fact, scarcely anything to Freud. She is scathingly critical of Freud's  theory of penis envy: Freud, she argued, ‘did not accept his patient's symptoms as evidence of a justified dissatisfaction with the limiting circumstances imposed on them by society, but as symptomatic of an independent and universal feminine tendency’(Millett, 1977, p. 179). He made a major (and foolish) confusion between biology and culture. Girls, Millett argues, are fully cognisant of male supremacy long before they see their brother's penis; and what they envy is not the penis, but the things to which having a penis gives the boy access — power, status and rewards. Freud ignored the more likely ‘social’ hypothesis for feminine dissatisfaction, preferring to ascribe it to a biologically based female nature. What we should be studying, Millett argues, are the effects of male-supremacist culture on the female ego. And what will undo these effects, she writes in the Postscript, is altered consciousness, and a process of ‘human growth and tru The ‘social’ factors of which Millett writes are here seen as pressures which are ‘external’to the self, and which have the effect of thwarting the conscious and unitary rationality of female individuality, or the female ego. And the task is that of removing their influence. If, in Lady Chatterley's Lover , the scales were to fall from Connie's eyes and she were to see the worship of Mellor's phallus for what it is, a means of subordinating and oppressing women, she could free herself and develop her authentic will, ego and individuality. The paradigm of coercion, writes Frye, is not the direct application of physical force. Rather, it is a situation in which choice and action do take place, and in which the victim acts under her own perception and judgement. Hence, what the exploiter needs is that the will and intelligence of the victim be disengaged from the projects of resistance and escape but that they not be simply broken or destroyed. Ideally, the disintegration and misintegration of the victim should accomplish the detachment of the victim's will and intelligence from the victim's own interests and their attachment to the interests of the exploiter. This will effect a displacement or dissolution of self-respect and will undermine the victim's intolerance of coercion. With that, the situation transcends the initial paradigmatic form or structure of coercion; for if people don't mind doing what you want them to do, you can't really be making them do it. (Frye, 1983, p. 60) And, she writes: The health and integrity of an organism is a matter of its being organised largely towards its own interests and welfare. She is healthy and ‘working right’ when her substance is organised primarily on principles which align it to her interests and welfare. Co-operation is essential of course, but it will not do that I arrange everything so that you get enough exercise: for me to be healthy, I must get enough exercise. My being adequately exercised is logically independent of your being so. (Ibid., p. 70) Frye is writing here as if it were possible to distinguish the interests of one self sharply from those of another, and as if , were the effects of male domination to be undone, it would not be too much of a problem for the self to know what its interests were. In various ways then, underlying much of the work of these three writers is a set of assumptions about the self. First, that it is, at least potentially, a unitary, rational thing, aware of its interests. Second, that ‘splits’ within the psyche should be seen as resulting from the interference of patriarchal or male-dominated socialisation or conditioning. Third, that the task of undoing this conditioning is one that can be achieved solely by a rational process of learning to understand and fight against the social and institutional effects of male domination. And implicit in these assumptions about the self, I think, is a conception of autonomy. Frye writes that ‘left to themselves’ women would not want to serve men. Daly writes of unveiling or unwinding the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy. Millett writes of the individuality and ego that women can discover in themselves once they recognise the effects of their patriarchal socialisation. And in all three, what is autonomous (or authentic) is what is seen as originating in some way from within the self; what is in some way untainted by the conditioning or manipulation to which a woman has previously been subjected. Before I come to discuss the philosophical problems that are raised by this sort of account of self and autonomy, I want to look at what I have called its implicit politics; and what I mean by this primarily is its possible consequences for the way in which women might think about their relationships to each other, and the way in which they might think about themselves. The first consequence seems to me to be this. Any view which sees self-affirmation  in terms of an ‘authentic’ inner self arising from the smashing of a socially conditioned ‘false self’, or which sees autonomy as a question of the origin of actions from ‘inside’rather than‘outside’, is almost bound to adopt, however implicitly, a derogatory attitude towards those who are not yet ‘authentic’. The precise nature and tone of this attitude may vary. But Mary Daly, for example, in GynlEcology , sometimes writes as if most women were really little more than the programmed, robotic puppets to which women were reduced in Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives ; the language of ‘fembots’ and ‘mutants’and ‘puppets’, whilst intended, I am sure, to enunciate a critique of women's oppressors, veers perilously near to sounding like contempt for those who are subject to that oppression. And this is related, for example, to Daly's scorn for ‘tokenism’— for those women who participate in what are seen as patriarchal institutions. Kate Millett's language is less obviously extreme. But the picture she paints of women is nevertheless often a derogatory one. She describes them, for example, as ‘infantilised’; she accepts without question research which purported to show that most women despised each other (Millett, 1977, p. 55); she sees women as having little ‘self-respect’, and as devoting almost all their time and attention to pleasing and flattering men. This implicitly derogatory attitude to women is linked both to an overmonolithic account of male power, and to a failure to give much attention to the ways in which women have, in fact, often spent much of their lives, and to the activities which have been particularly theirs (such as the rearing of children, for example). Sometimes women are depicted almost as a caricature of a male stereotype of themselves — they are servile, weak, powerless etc. (Millett even suggests (p. 56) that the fact that women commit less ‘crime’ than men is due to their patriarchal conditioning in passivity.) Millett basically dismisses the activities which have tended to dominate women's lives as ‘infantilising’, because they restrict women to the level, she argues, of the merely biological, and do not allow them to enter upon the ‘fully human’ activities which have been the province of men. And it is interesting, as Toril Moi (1985) points out, that in her discussion of literature, Millett concentrates almost wholly on male authors, with the exception of Charlotte Bronte, of whose work she tends to be very dismissive. Furthermore, as Moi suggests, she seems to avoid much in the way of recognition or acknowledgement of feminist work prior to her own, or of the existence of female traditions and strengths which  might have tended to challenge or subvert the supposedly monolithic nature of the male power which it is the main aim of her book to describe. Mary Daly's indictment of male power and brutality similarly allows little space for a consideration of the patterns of women's lives, or the strengths and capacities that these might have enabled them to develop. Her female Spirit-Self simply seems to rise mysteriously like a phoenix from the ashes of patriarchal conditioning. And Frye is sceptical about the possibility of women looking to their foremothers as a source of inspiration; of seeing some women, at least, as having led lives that were not wholly male-mediated. Feminist vision or imagination has no real resource to turn to. Now these kinds of accounts (or perhaps one might say failures to give an adequate account?) of women's lives are implicitly divisive and threatening. They are divisive because they have a tendency to divide women into two camps; those who have and those who have not shaken the dust of patriarchal conditioning from their feet. And they are threatening, because it is offensive and undermining to be told that the life one has led has merely been one of servility, that it has not been of truly ‘human’ value, that one has been a ‘fembot’or a ‘puppet’. I think that one important strand in the rejection of feminism by many women has been a feeling that feminists are saying that their lives have been of no value, and that their activities and concerns have been trivial. But this image of autonomy and of the self can be threatening, too, to women who do have a strong allegiance to feminism; and the threat intersects with assumptions that have been made in some feminist discourse about who is or is not ‘really’ a feminist. The threat arises because this account of autonomy is in fact often a strongly normative one; it presents an image of what a ‘feminist self’ should be like. To be autonomous or authentic one should be strong, independent, rational, coherent or consistent, able to distinguish clearly those aspects of one's previous self which derive from male-dominated conditioning and reject them. If one is ambivalent, conflicted, uncertain, confused, unwilling to make wholesale rejections, one stands to be accused, whether by oneself or by others, of bad faith, of lack of courage, of ‘selling out’, of tokenism. I am here giving an account of just one (influential) strand in feminist discourse. There are other strands which have rejected this account of self and autonomy. As I have said before, a picture of the  self as conscious, unitary and rational can be traced back, in Western philosophy, to Descartes. I do not have space here to discuss the various ways in which versions of this conception of self have been influential, in philosophy and psychology, for instance. But the major tradition which has queried this view of self has been that which derives from psychoanalysis. Feminism has had a complex relation to psychoanalysis. Freud's theories have been the target of a great deal of feminist criticism. In Sexual Politics , for example, Kate Millett sees Freud simply as the proponent of a biologistic theory of male supremacy, and as one of the arch-villains in the male plot of patriarchy. Other feminist writers, however, have tried to reevaluate the significance of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. And they have argued that, whilst feminism should indeed always have a critical relationship to psychoanalytic theory, the latter has within it the potential for allowing a better understanding of the complexities of human desires and of the psychological construction of ‘masculinity’ and ‘femininity’. Now any adequate account of self needs to be able, I think, to encompass and try to make intelligible the ways in which women and men experience themselves. And the central reasons for rejecting the ‘humanist’ paradigm of the self — as I have outlined it above — are, firstly, that there may be aspects of the development of self which are not easily accessible to consciousness, and secondly, that there are conscious experiences which are not easy to make intelligible within the humanist paradigm. I want now to look at some aspects of self-experience that I think should be central to any theory of self, and hence to any discussion of women's autonomy. Fantasy The dream (on which we may try hard to impose a narrative structure, to make sense of it) is unlike much fantasy in that it often doesn't, of itself, contain any such structure, and the ‘story’, if it tells one, may be deeply unintelligible to us. Much conscious fantasy is different; we may ‘tell a story’ to ourselves (or listen to a story and fantasise it as about ourselves); and sometimes we may attempt an imagined resolution, through fantasy, of some aspect of our social situation. One might, thus, fantasise the death of someone seen as a threat, or imagine oneself as possessing enormous fame or wealth. But fantasies, not always in the form of a coherent narrative, may  irrupt or intervene; one can be plagued, dominated or obsessed by them. Freud wrote of the way in which fantasies or desires, often seen as evil or dangerous, could come to dominate a person's life. Fantasy may be a threat; it may be inexplicable, bizarre and intrusive. Discovering the fantasies of others, too, may be threatening; the discovery, for example, as Rosalind Coward (1984) suggests, that the ‘mild’ man one lives with is a secret addict of sadomasochistic pornography. Female sexual fantasies can be disturbing as well. Why do many women find The Story of O erotic, and why is there a ‘split’ between sexual fantasy and that which one might find pleasurable or erotic in real life? Fantasy may be experienced both as pleasurable and as dangerous. But sometimes it can just be pleasurable. Coward discusses, for instance, the importance of the fact that one of the biggest growth areas in publishing in recent years has been women's romantic fiction. Unlike the ‘modern’ women's novel in which, usually after a series of disastrous sexual misadventures, the female heroine ends up (more or less)‘her own person’, romantic fiction is stylised, formulaic and unrealistic. It offers women, Coward argues, the fantasised pleasure (and apotheosis of sexual desire) of finding security in the strong arms of the hard-bitten patriarchal hero, along with the pleasure of having ‘tamed’ him and domesticated his wild ways by the power one enjoys over him in being a woman. We have to understand the pleasure there is for women in such fantasies. We have to understand what seems often to attract women more than men to soap operas, or to a passionate interest in the doings of the Royal Family. We need to understand how and why male fantasies may commonly differ from female ones, and why the sorts of fantasies I have mentioned, which may in some ways seem antithetical to feminism, may still have a strong appeal to women who have a feminist allegiance. The ‘Split’ Between Reason and Desire I will suggest, as a first example of this, a book by Suzanne Lowry, on Princess Diana, called The Princess in the Mirror (1985). The appearance of the book is at first glance like that of any other glossy book about the Royals. But it sets out, its author says, to deconstruct the image and appeal of the Princess. At the end of the book, Lowry states that the image of the Princess is conformist and reactionary, that it acts as a powerful form of social control, and that Diana is an unwitting agent of that. Yet the presentation of the book, and Lowry's text, often speak of a fascination with the Princess that is more than simply the fascination one can derive from the exercise of deconstructing an image. And this fascination is often in tension with the attempt to articulate a critique. Or think about the Fonda phenomenon. The text of Fonda's book,Women Coming of Age (1984), exhorts women not to ‘think thin', and its theme is mainly that of health. Yet the illustrations are nearly all of women who are pencil-thin enough not to be out of place on the catwalk in a Paris fashion show. The discourse of ‘health’ is almost inextricably intertwined, in the case of women, with discourse about youth and beauty and sexual attractiveness. The reasons women have for concern about fitness and health are often multiply overdetermined. Notions, for example, of Ageless Ageing (Kenton, 1986)slide between discussions of how to preserve a youthful skin and a young-looking body and how to stave off the ravages of appearing older, with discussions of mental vitality and energy, and so forth . A young-looking body is a sign of an alert mind. There is a type of feminist criticism, both in literature and other media (and in fields such as education), which has been called ‘Images of Women’ criticism. This has supposed that feminist effort should be devoted, first, to showing how the ‘images’ in question oppress or denigrate women, and second, to offering positive images of women to replace these. One problem with this kind of criticism is that the ‘images’ in question have often been misinterpreted, since they have been discussed without reference to the context or narrative structure in which they may appear. But there are two other problems with this type of criticism which I want to focus on here. First, what this approach often fails to recognise is the importance of understanding the appeal of the ‘images’ that are criticised; the relations they may have to women's pleasures, desires, fantasies, fears and conceptions of themselves. Second, it fails to recognise what is signally obvious in the experience of many women, myself of course included, namely that it is perfectly possible to agree ‘in one's head’ that certain images of women might be reactionary or damaging or oppressive, while remaining committed to them in emotion and desire. I suspect that this ‘split’ happens at times in all women, and perhaps particularly in those who have some commitment to feminism. And what it suggests is that structures of desire, emotion and fantasy have deep roots of  some sort in the self which are not necessarily amenable in any simple way to processes of conscious rational argument. An adequate theory of subjectivity has to recognise and try to understand these roots. Contradictions I have already identified more than one type of contradiction; those that can exist between one's fantasies and what one would actually do or enjoy in real life, and those that can exist between one's understanding of the oppressive nature of some discourse or practice and one's continuing investment of desire and finding of pleasure in it. In his Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1973), Freud discussed the way in which symptoms are experienced in certain forms of obsessional neurosis. He wrote: Obsessional neurosis is shown in the patient's being occupied with thoughts in which he is in fact not interested, in his being aware of impulses which appear very strange to him and his being led to actions the performance of which give him no enjoyment but which it is quite impossible for him to omit. The thoughts (obsessions) may be senseless in themselves, or merely a matter of indifference to the subject; often they are completely silly, and invariably they are the starting-point of a strenuous mental activity, which exhausts the patient and to which he only surrenders himself most unwillingly. (p.297) Obsessional neurosis is characterised, Freud argued, by the fact that the symptoms are not only debilitating, but are experienced by the person as alien ; they do not seem ‘part’ of him or her, and they seem discrepant with an everyday or normal sense of the self. In the case of many of Freud's patients the disruption and debilitation caused by the symptoms was so extreme that they were scarcely able to carry on their lives adequately at all. But Freud insisted that there was no sharp dividing line between ‘normal’ and ‘neurotic’people, and would have argued that similar, though less extreme, obsessions and apparently inexplicable compulsions can be found in all of us. In these cases, the self is, as it were, split against itself, subject to desires and impulses that seem ‘out of character’. But one cannot assume that an everyday ‘coherent’ sense of self is  readily available. One reason for this is that women (and men, of course) are often faced with the problem of negotiating contradictory or conflicting conceptions of themselves. Women may, for example, be required to be both sexually exciting and available,and modest and chaste. And gender relationships may be subject to the problems that can arise from conflicting discourses about femininity or masculinity. Men may, for example,both see themselves as ‘stronger’ than women and tend to see women as more weak and passive, but also see women as having a power over them that can seem to engulf the man in forms of emotional dependence by which he may feel threatened. Discourse about femininity and masculinity is by no means a homogeneous or stable thing. In the twentieth century, the advent of a ‘consumer culture’ and of mass communications has given questions about self and identity a peculiar intensity and difficulty in some respects. They have led, for example, to a focus on appearance and ‘style’, and the way in which these may ‘express’ one's individuality, that is historically novel. The clothes one wears, the ‘room of one's own’ in the Sunday Supplements: one may, apparently, now ‘try on’identities as if they really were clothes. And women have often tended to be the main target of fashion and ‘lifestyle’ talk. For all the rejection of what was sometimes called ‘woman garbage’ by American feminists, the issue of appearance is something that no woman can wholly avoid. Feminists too, of course, have used style of dress and demeanour to express a sense of self and of political commitment. (Elizabeth Wilson recorded once realising that she was more than usually anxious about the question of what to wear when she was going to talk to a feminist group.) Self-knowledge and Self-deception The concept of self-deception is one that has constantly puzzled philosophers. How can one both know and yet not know something about oneself. I do not have space here to discuss the question of self-deception in detail. But an important thing to recognise at the outset is that knowing about oneself can never be a matter of ‘mere information’. One cannot be distanced from or emotionally neutral about issues of self-knowledge. (Freud stressed this in his account of the transference in the analytic situation.) Herbert Fingarette (1959) uses the concept of ‘avowal’ to give an account of the concept of  self-deception. We do not see everything that we think or do or fantasise or desire as equally ‘central’ to ourselves. It is quite common, in everyday discourse, to say things like ‘I wasn't really myself’ or ‘It wasn't like me to do that’. Sometimes this process of rejection, of not avowing, is quite conscious. At other times it may be barely admitted to consciousness, if whatever it was is seen as threatening to the self. And sometimes it is, I think, not conscious at all. Psychoanalysts have talked, for example, about the process of ‘projection’, in which aspects of oneself of which one is fearful may be projected on to other people. (A number of writers have seen ‘projection’ as involved in the problem of masculinity, and have suggested that men may sometimes project their own fears of such things as emotional intimacy on to women, who are then seen as ‘bad’because they cause these problems.) Self-knowledge can never be a matter of easy or immediate introspection. This is partly because aspects of oneself may be disavowed, sometimes unconsciously, and partly because the ‘meaning’ of the deliverances of introspection is always dependent on an interpretation. One may be aware of feelings, sexual ones for example, that one is not able to conceptualise as sexual at the time. Freud believed that at the root of all neuroses lay repressed sexual desires, but even if one does not follow him in this, it would be hard to resist the conclusion that this was true of some of his patients. Sometimes his patients lacked the kind of knowledge that would have enabled them to interpret the experience as ‘sexual’ at all. Sometimes they possessed knowledge about sex, but could not admit that this was sexual, or that they had those sorts of desires. I have outlined above some of the experiences and the problems about subjectivity that any adequate theory of self must be able to encompass, in a way that the ‘humanist’ paradigm is, I think, unable to do. There are approaches to understanding and theorising self which depart radically from the humanist paradigm. I shall not attempt to enumerate them all here, nor do I think that feminism should accept any of them uncritically. What they share, despite their differences, is an insistence that there is no ‘original’ wholeness or unity in the self, nor a ‘real self’which can be thought of as in some way underlying the self of everyday life. The self is always a more or less precarious and conflictual construction out of, and compromise between, conflicting and not always conscious desires and experiences, which are born out of the ambivalences  and contradictions in human experience and relationships with others. Accounts of the construction of the self vary, in the degree of stress, for example, that they lay on the period of infancy and early childhood, and on the importance given to sexuality. But it seems to me that the theories of Freud must be seen as centrally important. It is sometimes argued that Freud's theories must be accepted or rejected all of a piece, and that one cannot simply accept or reject ‘bits’ of them as one fancies. It is true, I think, that there is a certain sort of eclecticism, practised for example by some neo-Freudian writers such as Erich Fromm or by the American ‘ego psychologists’, which may undermine anything useful that Freudian theory really has to offer. But whatever we may take or reject from Freud, what I think we should not lose is the way in which he raises questions and problematises things which are sometimes taken for granted. Freud questions any easy (or utopian) idea or ideal of the unity of the self, he questions the idea that self-knowledge could ever be a matter of simple introspection, and he sees issues about desire and fantasy as central to subjectivity. He stresses the way in which the acquisition of a gendered subjectivity is necessarily conflictual and involves struggle. And above all, perhaps, he forces a radical questioning of the concepts of the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’. Nothing could be further from the truth than Kate Millett's accusation that Freud believed that women's destiny was a simple outcome of their biology. In Freudian theory, there is a constant concern with the way in which entry into culture and human relationships, and the conflicts and struggle this causes, should be seen as constitutive of the human self. Freud's particular view of human culture was problematic. He stressed that psychoanalysis was never concerned solely with desires seen as arising unmediated from the body, but always with psychic representations of these. But he also believed in a sort of Lamarckian view of the inheritance of a ‘primal schema’ of desires and fantasies which determined the form taken by the Oedipal situation. The French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, argued that Freud himself (as well as virtually all the psychoanalysts who revised Freud's theories) never managed to escape fully from the assumption of an already existing gendered subjectivity which entered into the Oedipal situation. And Lacan argued that the human subject must be seen as constituted through language, through entry into the Symbolic Order. According to Lacan, the aim  of psychoanalysis should be rigorously to deconstruct and expose the contradictions and radical fissues in which human subjectivity is born. Feminism, as I have said, needs to preserve a critical distance from all theories of self. But it needs also to engage with those theories which deconstruct the distinction between the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’, which recognise the power of desire and fantasy and the problems of supposing any ‘original’unity in the self, while at the same time preserving its concern with lived experience and the practical and material struggles of women to achieve more autonomy and control over their lives. The appeal of what I have called the ‘humanist paradigm’ lies, I think, in the way it can seem to conceptualise the need women have experienced for this greater degree of autonomy and control, for overcoming the fragmentation and contradictions in their lives, and for a capacity for self-definition. No theory of self should lose sight of these things. I have argued, however, that there are also aspects of women's experience which the humanist paradigm is unable to conceptualise adequately; hence the appeal of theories which attempt to ‘deconstruct’ the self in more radical ways. But the danger in some ‘deconstructionist’ theories, however, is that they seem to leave no space for the material struggles or ordinary aspirations of women. Thus it seems that Lacanian psychoanalysis, both in theory and practice, aims merely to show what a fragmented, decentred thing the human subject is, and Lacan has dismissed all talk of ‘unity’ or ‘identity’as an illusion. It can be argued (though I do not have space to do it here), that there is an incoherence in a view of the subject which regards all notions of unity as an illusion. But there is also a practical and political problem, since it is difficult to see how such a theory could speak in any way to the practical or material concerns of women. The problem, then, is not to be seen as one of whether we should continue to use concepts like ‘identity’ or ‘autonomy’at all, or simply reject them out of hand. It is a problem, rather, of how to offer an interpretation of them which neither assumes the original unitary self of the humanist paradigm, nor ignores the needs of women. And Freud can again provide a useful starting point. It is true that Freudian theory questions any notion of the original unity of the self. But it is not true that Freudian theory has no space for ideas of unity or autonomy. The purpose of psychoanalytic therapy, according to Freud, was to remove the power of the symptom by  making it intelligible, by showing the sense that it had. Psychoanalysis aimed to trace its roots in unconscious desires (though this was not a process merely of intellectual understanding). The unintelligible, alien quality of the symptom will be removed. But for this to happen, a person's conception of themselves must also be transformed. They must, for example, be able to think of themselves as ‘the sort of person who does have incestuous sexual desires’, is prepared to avow them as ‘part’ of the self, and ceases to be so threatened by them. Part of this process of change is a greater tolerance of certain aspects of oneself, and a lesser propensity for these to cause guilt or anxiety. But, paradoxically perhaps, this greater tolerance may result in less fragmentation, more coherence, and less subjection to the forms of anxiety or guilt or compulsive behaviour that may once have been so deeply disturbing or threatening. It seems to me that there is a sort of dialectic we need to preserve when thinking about autonomy. There is no authentic or unified ‘original’ self which can simply be recovered or discovered as the source of ‘autonomous’actions. But we are often faced with the experienced need to make ‘sense’ of our lives and our feelings and goals, to relate confused fragments of ourselves into something that seems more coherent and of which we feel more in control. We are often also faced, however, with the need to tolerate contradictions, not to strive for an illusory or impossible ideal, and to avoid self-punishing forms of anxiety, defence and guilt (and feminist guilt can be as punishing as any other kind). The dialectic of autonomy is one in which a constant (but never static or final) search for control and coherence needs balancing against a realism and tolerance born out of efforts to understand ourselves (and others) better."
ACA ACA-F9V-001 -1 "1 Introduction: linguistic forms and functions The functions of language The analysis of discourse is, necessarily, the analysis of language in use. As such, it cannot be restricted to the description of linguistic forms independent of the purposes or functions which those forms are designed to serve in human affairs. While some linguists may concentrate on determining the formal properties of a language, the discourse analyst is committed to an investigation of what that language is used for. While the formal approach has a long tradition, manifested in innumerable volumes of grammar, the functional approach is less well documented. Attempts to provide even a general set of labels for the principal functions of language have resulted in vague, and often confusing, terminology. We will adopt only two terms to describe the major functions of language and emphasise that this division is an analytic convenience. It would be unlikely that, on any occasion, a natural language utterance would be used to fulfil only one function, to the total exclusion of the other. That function which language serves in the expression of ‘content’ we will describe as transactional,and that function involved in expressing social relations and personal attitudes we will describe as interactional. Our distinction, ‘transactional /interactional’, stands in general correspondence to the functional dichotomies —‘representative /expressive’, found in Bühler (1934), ‘referential /emotive’(Jakobson, 1960), ‘ideational /interpersonal’(Halliday, 1970b) and ‘descriptive /social-expressive’(Lyons, 1977), The transactional view Linguists and linguistic philosophers tend to adopt a limited approach to the functions of language in society. While they  frequently acknowledge that language may be used to perform many communicative functions, they nonetheless make the general assumption that the most important function is the communication of information. Thus Lyons (1977: 32) observes that the notion of communication is readily used ‘of feelings, moods and attitudes’ but suggests that he will be primarily interested in ‘the intentional transmission of factual, or propositional, information’. Similarly Bennett (1976: 5) remarks ‘it seems likely that communication is primarily a matter of a speaker's seeking either to inform a hearer of something or to enjoin some action upon him’. The value of the use of language to transmit information is well embedded in our cultural mythology. We all believe that it is the faculty of language which has enabled the human race to develop diverse cultures, each with its distinctive social customs, religious observances, laws, oral traditions, patterns of trading, and so on. We all believe, moreover, that it is the acquisition of written language which has permitted the development within some of these cultures of philosophy, science and literature (see Goody, 1977). We all believe that this development is made possible by the ability to transfer information through the use of language, which enables man to utilise the knowledge of his forebears, and the knowledge of other men in other cultures. We shall call the language which is used to convey ‘factual or propositional information’primarily transactional language. In primarily transactional language we assume that what the speaker (or writer) has primarily in mind is the efficient transference of information. Language used in such a situation is primarily ‘message oriented’. It is important that the recipient gets the informative detail correct. Thus if a policeman gives directions to a traveller, a doctor tells a nurse how to administer medicine to a patient, a householder puts in an insurance claim, a shop assistant explains the relative merits of two types of knitting wool, or a scientist describes an experiment, in each case it matters that the speaker should make what he says (or writes) clear. There will be unfortunate (even disastrous) consequences in the real world if the message is not properly understood by the recipient. The interactional view Whereas linguists, philosophers of language and psycho-linguists  have, in general, paid particular attention to the use of language for the transmission of ‘factual or propositional information’, sociologists and sociolinguists have been particularly concerned with the use of language to establish and maintain social relationships. In sociological and anthropological literature the phatic use of language has been frequently commented on — particularly the conventional use of language to open talk-exchanges and to close them. Conversational analysts have been particularly concerned with the use of language to negotiate role-relationships, peer-solidarity, the exchange of turns in a conversation, the saving of face of both speaker and hearer (cf. Labov, 1972a; Brown and Levinson, 1978; Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974; Lakoff, 1973). It is clearly the case that a great deal of everyday human interaction is characterised by the primarily interpersonal rather than the primarily transactional use of language. When two strangers are standing shivering at a bus-stop in an icy wind and one turns to the other and says ‘My goodness, it's cold’, it is difficult to suppose that the primary intention of the speaker is to convey information. It seems much more reasonable to suggest that the speaker is indicating a readiness to be friendly and to talk. Indeed a great deal of ordinary everyday conversation appears to consist of one individual commenting on something which is present to both him and his listener. The weather is of course the most quoted example of this in British English. However a great deal of casual conversation contains phrases and echoes of phrases which appear more to be intended as contributions to a conversation than to be taken as instances of information-giving. Thus a woman on a bus describing the way a mutual friend has been behaving, getting out of bed too soon after an operation, concludes her turn in the conversation by saying Aye, she's an awfy woman. (awfy = Sc awful) This might be taken as an informative summary. Her neighbour then says reflectively (having been supportively uttering aye, aye throughout the first speaker's turn): Aye, she's an awfy woman. Pirsig (1976: 313)remarks of such a conversation: ‘the conversation's pace intrigues me. It isn't intended to go anywhere, just fill  the time of day…on and on and on with no point or purpose other than to fill the time, like the rocking of a chair.’ What seems to be primarily at issue here is the sharing of a common point of view. Brown & Levinson point out the importance for social relationships of establishing common ground and agreeing on points of view, and illustrate the lengths to which speakers in different cultures will go to maintain an appearance of agreement, and they remark ‘agreement may also be stressed by repeating part or all of what the preceding speaker has said’(1978:117) Whereas, as we shall note, written language is, in general, used for primarily transactional purposes, it is possible to find written genres whose purpose is not primarily to inform but to maintain social relationships-'thank you' letters, love letters, games of consequences, etc. Spoken and written language Manner of production From the point of view of production, it is clear that spoken and written language make somewhat different demands on language-producers. The speaker has available to him the full range of ‘voice quality’ effects (as well as facial expression, postural and gestural systems). Armed with these he can always override the effect of the words he speaks. Thus the speaker who says ‘I'd really like to’, leaning forward, smiling, with a ‘warm, breathy’ voice quality, is much more likely to be interpreted as meaning what he says, than another speaker uttering the same words, leaning away, brow puckered, with a ‘sneering, nasal’voice quality. These paralinguistic cues are denied to the writer. We shall generally ignore paralinguistic features in spoken language in this book since the data we shall quote from is spoken by co-operative adults who are not exploiting paralinguistic resources against the verbal meanings of their utterances but are, rather, using them to reinforce the meaning. Not only is the speaker controlling the production of communicative systems which are different from those controlled by the writer, he is also processing that production under circumstances which are considerably more demanding. The speaker must monitor what it is that he has just said, and determine whether it  matches his intentions, while he is uttering his current phrase and monitoring that, and simultaneously planning his next utterance and fitting that into the overall pattern of what he wants to say and monitoring, moreover, not only his own performance but its reception by his hearer. He has no permanent record of what he has said earlier, and only under unusual circumstances does he have notes which remind him what he wants to say next. The writer, on the contrary, may look over what he has already written, pause between each word with no fear of his interlocutor interrupting him, take his time in choosing a particular word, even looking it up in the dictionary if necessary, check his progress with his notes, reorder what he has written, and even change his mind about what he wants to say. Whereas the speaker is under considerable pressure to keep on talking during the period allotted to him, the writer is characteristically under no such pressure. Whereas the speaker knows that any words which pass his lips will be heard by his interlocutor and, if they are not what he intends, he will have to undertake active, public ‘repair’, the writer can cross out and rewrite in the privacy of his study. There are, of course, advantages for the speaker. He can observe his interlocutor and, if he wishes to, modify what he is saying to make it more accessible or acceptable to his hearer. The writer has no access to immediate feedback and simply has to imagine the reader's reaction. It is interesting to observe the behaviour of individuals when given a choice of conducting a piece of business in person or in writing. Under some circumstances a face-to-face interaction is preferred but, in others, for a variety of different reasons, the individual may prefer to conduct his transaction in writing. Whereas in a spoken interaction the speaker has the advantage of being able to monitor his listener's minute-by-minute reaction to what he says, he also suffers from the disadvantage of exposing his own feelings ('leaking'; Ekman & Friesen, 1969) and of having to speak clearly and concisely and make immediate response to whichever way his interlocutor reacts. The representation of discourse: texts So far we have considered in very general terms some of the differences in the manner of production of writing and speech. Before we go on to discuss some of the ways in which the forms of  speech and writing differ, we shall consider, in the next two sections, some of the problems of representing written and spoken language. We shall place this within a general discussion of what it means to represent ‘a text’. We shall use text as a technical term, to refer to the verbal record of a communicative act. (For another approach to text cf. discussion in Chapter 6.) Written texts The notion of ‘text’ as a printed record is familiar in the study of literature. A ‘text’ may be differently presented in different editions, with different type-face, on different sizes of paper, in one or two columns, and we still assume, from one edition to the next, that the different presentations all represent the same ‘text’. It is important to consider just what it is that is ‘the same’. Minimally, the words should be the same words, presented in the same order. Where there are disputed readings of texts, editors usually feel obliged to comment on the crux; so of Hamlet's O, that this too too sullied flesh would melt (1. ii.129) Dover Wilson makes it clear that this is an interpretation, since the second Quarto gives ‘too too sallied’ and the first Folio ‘too too solid’(Dover Wilson, 1934). Even where there is no doubt about the identity of words and their correct sequence, replicating these alone does not guarantee an adequate representation of a text. Consider the following extract of dialogue from Pride and Prejudice: ‘Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.’ ‘You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.’ It is clear that more than simply reproducing the words in their correct order is required. It is necessary to replicate punctuation conventions, as well as the lineation which indicates the change of speaker. The extract reads as gobbledygook if it is read as a speech by one individual. An adequate representation of a text must assign speeches to the correct characters, sentences to the correct paragraphs, and paragraphs to the correct chapters. The author's organisation and staging of his work must be preserved. In a piece of expository prose, the author's indication of the development of the argument contributes to the reader's experience of the text. Thus titles, chapter headings, sub-divisions and sub-headings all indicate to the reader how the author intends his argument to be chunked. The detail of lineation rarely matters in expository or descriptive prose. However it clearly becomes crucial in the reproduction of poetry. The work of those seventeenth-century poets who created poems in the shape of diamonds or butterflies would be largely incomprehensible if the form were not preserved. The notion of ‘text’ reaches beyond the reproduction of printed material in some further printed form. A letter, handwritten in purple ink with many curlicues, may have its text reproduced in printed form. Similarly, neutral printed versions may be produced of handwritten shopping lists, slogans spray-painted on to hoardings, and public notices embossed on metal plates. In each case the ‘text’ will be held to have been reproduced if the words, the punctuation and, where relevant, the lineation are reproduced accurately. Where the original text exploits typographical variety, a text reproduced in one type-face may lack some of the quality of the original. An obvious example is a newspaper item which may exploit several different type-faces, different sizes of type and a particular shape of lay-out. It is interesting to observe that publishers regularly reproduce conscious manipulation of the written medium on the part of the writer. Thus Jane Austen's expression of contrast is reproduced by publishers in italics: ‘Nay,’ said Elizabeth, ‘this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. I only want to think you perfect …’ Similarly Queen Victoria's use of underlining in her handwritten journal is represented by her publishers in the printed version with an italic type-face to represent the emphasis she wishes to indicate when writing of Lord Melbourne: he gave me such a kind, and I may say,fatherly look (Thursday, 28 June 1838) Where the writer is deliberately exploiting the resources of the written medium, it seems reasonable to suggest that that manipulation constitutes part of the text. A further illustration of this is to be found in the conventions governing spelling. In general we assume that words have a standardised spelling in British English. The fact of the standardisation enables authors to manipulate idiosyncratic spelling to achieve special effects. Thus in Winnie-the-Pooh the publishers reproduce the notice outside Owl's house in one inset line, using capitals, and with the author's own spelling: PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID The point that the author makes with this particular spelling would be lost if the words were reproduced in their standard form. It might then be claimed that such a form of the text was incomplete or inadequate, because the point which the author wishes to make is no longer accessible from the written text. Indeed the importance of the correct citing of an author's spelling is regularly marked by the insertion of sic into a citation by a second author who wishes to disclaim responsibility for an aberrant spelling. We have so far been making the simplifying assumption that it is clear, in all cases, what the original text consists of. Where handwritten texts are at issue, it is often the case that the individual reproducing the text in a printed version has to make a considerable effort of interpretation to assign a value to some of the less legible words. In literature, as we have remarked already, uncertainty may give rise to cruces, to disputed texts. In letters, prescriptions, shopping lists, school essays, the reader normally pushes through a once-for-all interpretation of a text which may never be read again. It must be clear however, that a printed version of a handwritten text is, in an important sense, an interpretation. This is particularly clear in the handwritten attempts of very young children where the adult is obliged to assign each large painstakingly formed letter token to a particular type of letter, which he may then re-interpret in the light of the larger message. Thus we have before us a page with a drawing of a large animal (reported to be a lion) and a table with a goldfish bowl on it. The five-year-old writes below what might be transliterated as: 1 the lion wos the fish to ti it 2 the cat wants to get dwon the steis 3 with qwt to dsthhb thelion A possible interpretation of the text thus represented might be: The lion wants the fish, to eat it. The cat wants to get down the stairs without to disturb the lion. The transliteration of the original with qwt,in line 3, reasonably accurately represents the first letter (which might also be represented as a figure nine if nine has a straight back stroke). A more charitable and interpretive transliteration would render it as a (i.e. ‘unhatted’a with a long backstroke (a. ). We shall return to the problem of the interpretive work of the reader /listener in identifying the words which constitute the text, in the next section. Spoken texts The problems encountered with the notion of ‘text’ as the verbal record of a communicative act become a good deal more complex when we consider what is meant by spoken ‘text’. The simplest view to assume is that a tape-recording of a communicative act will preserve the ‘text’. The tape-recording may also preserve a good deal that may be extraneous to the text — coughing, chairs creaking, buses going past, the scratch of a match lighting a cigarette. We shall insist that these events do not constitute part of the text (though they may form part of the relevant context, cf. Chapter 2). In general the discourse analyst works with a tape-recording of an event, from which he then makes a written transcription, annotated according to his interests on a particular occasion — transcriptions of the sort which will appear in this book. He has to determine what constitutes the verbal event, and what form he will transcribe it in. Unless the analyst produces a fine-grained phonetic transcription (which very few people would be able to read fluently) details of accent and pronunciation are lost. In general, analysts represent speech using normal orthographic conventions. The analyst may hear an utterance which might be transcribed phonemically as /greipbritn /. Is he to render this orthographically as grape britain? Hardly. He will interpret what he hears and normalise to the  conventional orthographic form Great Britain inserting conventional word boundaries in the orthographic version which do not, of course, exist in the acoustic signal. If he hears a form /gene /, is he to render this in the orthography as gonna (which for some readers may have a peculiarly American association) or gointuh or going to? The problem is a very real one, because most speakers constantly simplify words phonetically in the stream of speech (see Brown, 1977: ch. 4). If the analyst normalises to the conventional written form, the words take on a formality and specificity which necessarily misrepresent the spoken form. Problems with representing the segmental record of the words spoken pale into insignificance compared with the problems of representing the suprasegmental record (details of intonation and rhythm). We have no standard conventions for representing the paralinguistic features of the utterance which are summarised as ‘voice quality’, yet the effect of an utterance being said kindly and sympathetically is clearly very different from the effect if it is said brutally and harshly. Similarly it is usually possible to determine from a speaker's voice his or her sex, approximate age and educational status, as well as some aspects of state of health and personality (see Abercrombie, I968; Laver, 1980). It is not customary to find any detail relating to these indexical features of the speaker in transcriptions by discourse analysts. In general, too, rhythmic and temporal features of speech are ignored in transcriptions; the rhythmic structure which appears to bind some groups of words more closely together than others, and the speeding up and slowing down of the overall pace of speech relative to the speaker's normal pace in a given speech situation, are such complex variables that we have very little idea how they are exploited in speech and to what effect (but, cf. Butterworth, 1980). It seems reasonable to suggest, though, that these variables, together with pause and intonation, perform the functions in speech that punctuation,capitalization ,italicization , paragraphing etc. perform in written language. If they constitute part of the textual record in written language, they should be included as part of the textual record in spoken language. If it is relevant to indicate Queen Victoria's underlining, then it is surely also relevant to indicate, for example, a speaker's use of high pitch and loudness to indicate emphasis. The response of most analysts to this complex problem is to present their transcriptions of the spoken text using the conventions of the written language. Thus Cicourel (1973) reproduces three utterances recorded in a classroom in the following way: 1 Ci: Like this? 2 T: Okay, yeah, all right, now… 3 Ri:Now what are we going to do? In I and 3 we have to assume that the? indicates that the utterance functions as a question — whether it is formally marked by, for instance, rising intonation in the case of I, we are not told. Similarly the status of commas in the speech of the T(eacher) is not made explicit — presumably they are to indicate pauses in the stream of speech, but it may be that they simply indicate a complex of rhythmic and intonational cues which the analyst is responding to. What must be clear in a transcript of this kind is that a great deal of interpretation by the analyst has gone on before the reader encounters this ‘data’. If the analyst chooses to italicise a word in his transcription to indicate, for example, the speaker's high pitch and increased loudness, he has performed an interpretation on the acoustic signal, an interpretation which, he has decided, is in effect equivalent to a writer's underlining of a word to indicate emphasis. There is a sense, then, in which the analyst is creating the text which others will read. In this creation of the written version of the spoken text he makes appeal to conventional modes of interpretation which, he believes, are shared by other speakers of the language. It must be further emphasised that, however objective the notion of ‘text’ may appear as we have defined it ('the verbal record of a communicative act'), the perception and interpretation of each text is essentially subjective. Different individuals pay attention to different aspects of texts. The content of the text appeals to them or fits into their experience differently. In discussing texts we idealise away from this variability of the experiencing of the text and assume what Schutz has called ‘the reciprocity of perspective’, whereby we take it for granted that readers of a text or listeners to a text share the same experience (Schutz, 1953). Clearly for a great  deal of ordinary everyday language this assumption of an amount of overlap of point of view sufficient to allow mutual comprehension is necessary. From time to time however we are brought to a halt by different interpretations of ‘the same text’. This is particularly the case when critical attention is being focused on details of spoken language which were only ever intended by the speaker as ephemeral parts, relatively unimportant, of the working-out of what he wanted to say. It seems fair to suggest that discourse analysis of spoken language is particularly prone to over-analysis. A text frequently has a much wider variety of interpretations imposed upon it by analysts studying it at their leisure, than would ever have been possible for the participants in the communicative interaction which gives rise to the ‘text’. Once the analyst has ‘created’ a written transcription from a recorded spoken version, the written text is available to him in just the way a literary text is available to the literary critic. It is important to remember, when we discuss spoken ‘texts’, the transitoriness of the original. It must be clear that our simple definition of ‘text’ as ‘the verbal record of a communicative act’requires at least two hedges: i the representation of a text which is presented for discussion may in part, particularly where the written representation of a spoken text is involved, consist of a prior analysis (hence interpretation) of a fragment of discourse by the discourse analyst presenting the text for consideration ii features of the original production of the language, for example shaky handwriting or quavering speech, are somewhat arbitrarily considered as features of the text rather than features of the context in which the language is produced. The relationship between speech and writing The view that written language and spoken language serve, in general, quite different functions in society has been forcefully propounded, hardly surprisingly, by scholars whose main interest lies in anthropology and sociology. Thus Goody & Watt (1963) and Goody (1977) suggest that analytic thinking  followed the acquisition of written language ‘since it was the setting down of speech that enabled man clearly to separate words, to manipulate their order and to develop syllogistic forms of reasoning’(Goody, 1977: 11). Goody goes on to make even larger claims about the ways in which the acquisition of writing, which permits man to reflect upon what he has thought, has permitted the development of cognitive structures which are not available to the non-literate (cf. also the views of Vygotsky, 1962). He examines the use of ‘figures of the written word’ in various cultures, particularly the ‘non-speech uses of language’which develop systems of classification like lists, formulae, tables and ‘recipes for the organisation and development of human knowledge’(1977: 17). Goody suggests that written language has two main functions: the first is the storage function which permits communication over time and space, and the second is that which ‘shifts language from the oral to the visual domain' and permits words and sentences to be examined out of their original contexts, ‘where they appear in a very different and highly ‘abstract’ context' (1977: 78). It seems reasonable to suggest that, whereas in daily life in a literate culture, we use speech largely for the establishment and maintenance of human relationships (primarily interactional use), we use written language largely for the working out of and transference of information (primarily transactional use). However, there are occasions when speech is used for the detailed transmission of factual information. It is noteworthy, then, that the recipient often writes down the details that he is told. So a doctor writes down his patient's symptoms, an architect writes down his client's requirements, Hansard records the proceedings of the British Parliament, we write down friends' addresses, telephone numbers, recipes, knitting patterns, and so on. When the recipient is not expected to write down the details, it is often the case that the speaker repeats them sometimes several times over. Consider the typical structure of a news broadcast which opens with the ‘headlines’— a set of summary statements — which are followed by a news item that consists of an expansion and repetition of the first headline, in which is embedded a comment from ‘our man on the spot’ that recapitulates the main points again, then, at the end of the broadcast, there is a repetition of the set of headlines. There is a general expectation that people will not remember detailed facts  correctly if they are only exposed to them in the spoken mode, especially if they are required to remember them over an extended period of time. This aspect of communication is obviously what written language is supremely good at, whether for the benefit of the individual in remembering the private paraphernalia of daily life, or for the benefit of nations in establishing constitutions, laws and treaties with other nations. The major differences between speech and writing derive from the fact that one is essentially transitory and the other is designed to be permanent. It is exactly this point which D. J. Enright makes in the observation that ‘Plato may once have thought more highly of speech than of writing, but I doubt he does now!’ (Review in The Sunday Times , 24 January 1982). Differences in form between written and spoken language It is not our intention here to discuss the many different forms of spoken language which can be identified even within one geographical area like Britain. Clearly there are dialectal differences, accent differences, as well as‘register’ differences depending on variables like the topic of discussion and the roles of the participants (see e.g. Trudgill, 1974 and Hudson, 1980 for discussion of these sorts of differences). There is however, one further distinction which is rarely noted, but which it is important to draw attention to here. That is the distinction between the speech of those whose language is highly influenced by long and constant Immersion in written language forms, and the speech of those whose language is relatively uninfluenced by written forms of language. It is of course the case that it is the speech of the first set whose language tends to be described in descriptions of the language (grammars), since descriptions are typically written by middle-aged people who have spent long years reading written language. In particular situations the speech of, say, an academic, particularly if he is saying something he has said or thought about before, may have a great deal in common with written language forms. For the majority of the population, even of a ‘literate’ country, spoken language will have very much less in common with the written language. This, again, is a point appreciated by Goody: ‘Some individuals spend more time with the written language than they do with the spoken. Apart from the effects on their own  personalities…what are the effects on language? How do written languages differ from spoken ones?’(1977: 124). In the discussion which follows we shall draw a simplistic distinction between spoken and written language which takes highly literate written language as the norm of written language, and the speech of those who have not spent many years exposed to written language (a set which will include most young undergraduate students) as the norm for spoken language. In 1.2.1 we discussed some of the differences in the manner of production of speech and writing, differences which often contribute significantly to characteristic forms in written language as against characteristic forms in speech. The overall effect is to produce speech which is less richly organised than written language, containing less densely packed information, but containing more interactive markers and planning ‘fillers’. The standard descriptive grammars of English (e.g. Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech & Svartvik, 1972) typically describe features of the written language, or that form of the spoken language which is highly influenced by written language. From the descriptive work of a number of scholars studying spoken language (e.g. Labov, 1972a; Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975; Chafe, 1979; Ochs, 1979; Cicourel, 1981; Goffman, 1981) we can extract some (by no means all) features which characterise spoken language: a the syntax of spoken language is typically much less structured than that of written language i spoken language contains many incomplete sentences, often simply sequences ii spoken language typically contains rather little subordination iii in conversational speech, where sentential syntax can be observed, active declarative forms are normally found. In over 50 hours of recorded conversational speech, Brown, Currie and Kenworthy (1980) found very few examples of passives, it-clefts or wh-clefts. Crystal(1980) also presents some of the problems encountered in attempting to analyse spontaneous speech in terms of categories like sentence and clause  As a brief example, notice how this speaker pauses and begins each new ‘sentence’ before formally completing the previous one: it's quite nice the Grassmarket since + it's always had the antique shops but they're looking + they're sort of + em + become a bit nicer + b in written language an extensive set of metalingual markers exists to mark relationships between clauses (that complementisers,when I while temporal markers, so-called ‘logical connectors’ like besides, moreover, however, in spite of,etc.), in spoken language the largely paratactically organised chunks are related by and, but, then and, more rarely,if. The speaker is typically less explicit than the writer:I'm so tired (because)I had to walk all the way home. In written language rhetorical organisers of larger stretches of discourse appear, like firstly, more important than and in conclusion. These are rare in spoken language. c In written language, rather heavily premodified noun phrases (like that one) are quite common — it is rare in spoken language to find more than two premodifying adjectives and there is a strong tendency to structure the short chunks of speech so that only one predicate is attached to a given referent at a time (simple case-frame or one-place predicate) as in:it's a biggish cat + tabby + with torn ears,or in:old man McArthur + he was a wee chap + oh very small + and eh a beard + and he was pretty stooped . The packaging of information related to a particular referent can, in the written language, be very concentrated, as in the following news item:A man who turned into a human torch ten days ago after snoozing in his locked car while smoking his pipe has died in hospital. (Evening News (Edinburgh), 22 April 1982) d Whereas written language sentences are generally structured in subject-predicate form, in spoken language it is  quite common to find what Givo/1n (1979b) calls topic-comment structure, as in the cats + did you let them out . e in informal speech, the occurrence of passive constructions is relatively infrequent. That use of the passive in written language which allows non-attribution of agency is typically absent from conversational speech. Instead, active constructions with indeterminate group agents are noticeable, as in:Oh everything they do in Edinburgh + they do it far too slowly  f in chat about the immediate environment, the speaker may rely on (e.g.) gaze direction to supply a referent:(looking at the rain) frightful isn't it. g the speaker may replace or refine expressions as he goes along:this man + this chap she was going out with  h the speaker typically uses a good deal of rather generalised vocabulary:a lot of, got, do, thing, nice, stuff, place and things like that . i the speaker frequently repeats the same syntactic form several times over, as this fairground inspector does: I look at fire extinguishers + I look at fire exits + I look at what gangways are available + I look at electric cables what + are they properly earthed + are they properly covered  j the speaker may produce a large number of prefabricated ‘fillers’:well, erm, I think, you know, if you see what I mean, of course, and so on . Some of the typical distinctions between discourse which has been written and that which has been spoken can be seen in the following two descriptions of a rainbow. (No direct comparison is intended, since the two pieces of discourse were produced in strictly non-comparable circumstances for very different purposes.) And then, in the blowing clouds, she saw a band of faint iridescence colouring in faint shadows a portion of the hill. And forgetting, startled, she looked for the hovering colour and saw a rainbow forming itself. In one place it gleamed fiercely, and, her heart anguished with hope, she sought the shadow of iris where the bow should be. Steadily the colour gathered, mysteriously, from nowhere, it took presence upon itself, there was a faint, vast rainbow. (D. H. Lawrence,The Rainbow , chapter 16) In the first extract (I), the rich lexis and well-organised structure are indications that the writer has taken time in the construction, and possibly reconstruction after several rewritings, of the final product. There are complete sentences, containing subordinations, frequent modifications via adjectives and adverbs, and more than single predicates per referential expression. In extract (2), there are frequent pauses, often interrupting major syntactic units, repetitions, incomplete sentences, generalised vocabulary, fillers and one example of a tongue-slip. normally after + very heavy rain + or something like that + and + you're driving along the road + and + far away + you see + well + er + a series + of + stripes + + formed like a bow + an arch + + very very far away + ah + seven colours but + + I guess you hardly ever see seven it's just a + a series of + colours which + they seem to be separate but if you try to look for the separate (kAz)— colours they always seem + very hard + to separate + if you see what I mean ++ (Postgraduate student speaking informally) The speaker planning in the here-and-now, possibly threatened with his interlocutor wanting to take a turn, typically repeats himself a good deal, using the same syntactic structure, the same lexical items, using the first word that comes to mind rather than hunting for the mot juste ,filling in pauses with ‘fillers’. The overall effect is of information produced in a much less dense manner than is characteristic of written language. We must assume that the density of information packing in spoken language is appropriate for the listener to process comfortably. Most people have experienced expository prose read aloud which they have found difficult to follow in the spoken mode. Few people can extract a great deal from a lecture which is read aloud with no visual support. Goody  points out that the written form of language releases us from the linear experiential mode: ‘the fact that it takes a visual form means that one can escape from the problem of the succession of events in time, by backtracking, skipping, looking to see who-done-it before we know what it is they did. Who, except the most obsessive academic, reads a book as he hears speech? Who, except the most avant-garde of modern dramatists, attempts to write as they speak?’(1977:124). Sentence and utterance It might seem reasonable to propose that the features of spoken language outlined in the preceding section should be considered as features of utterances, and those features typical of written language as characteristic of sentences. In this convenient distinction, we can say, in a fairly non-technical way, that utterances are spoken and sentences are written and that we will apply these terms to what Lyons describes as ‘the products of ordinary language-behaviour’. In the case of the term sentence,it is important to be clear about the type of object one is referring to. Lyons makes a distinction between ‘text-sentences’ and ‘system-sentences’. He describes the latter in the following way: system-sentences never occur as the products of ordinary language-behaviour. Representations of system-sentences may of course be used in metalinguistic discussion of the structure and functions of language: and it is such representations that are customarily cited in grammatical descriptions of particular languages. (Lyons, 1977:31) Since the linguistic exemplification presented in support of our discussion throughout this book is overwhelmingly drawn from ‘ordinary language behaviour’, we shall generally employ the term ‘sentence’ in the ‘text-sentence’, and not the ‘system-sentence’sense. Although the linguist who undertakes the analysis of discourse has ultimately the same aims as a linguist who uses ‘system-sentences’ in his grammatical description of a language, there are important methodological differences involved in the two approaches. Both linguists wish to produce accurate descriptions of the particular language studied. In pursuit of this goal, the  grammarian will concentrate on a particular body of data and attempt to produce an exhaustive but economical set of rules which will account for all and only the acceptable sentences in his data. He will not normally seek to account for the mental processes involved in any language-user's production of those sentences, nor to describe the physical or social contexts in which those sentences occur. On each of these issues, concerning ‘data’, ‘rules’, ‘processes’ and ‘contexts’, the discourse analyst will take a different view. On ‘data' The grammarian's ‘data’ is inevitably the single sentence, or a set of single sentences illustrating a particular feature of the language being studied. It is also typically the case that the grammarian will have constructed the sentence or sentences he uses as examples. This procedure is not often made explicit, but an overt commitment to the constructed-data approach has recently been expressed in the following terms: I shall assume…that invented strings and certain intuitive judgements about them constitute legitimate data for linguistic research. (Gazdar, 1979: 11) In contrast, the analysis of discourse, as undertaken and exemplified in this book, is typically based on the linguistic output of someone other than the analyst. On the few occasions where constructed data is used as illustration (of a paradigm, for example, in Chapter 4), it is inevitably directed towards accounting for the range of formal options available to a speaker or writer. More typically, the discourse analyst's ‘data’ is taken from written texts or tape-recordings. It is rarely in the form of a single sentence. This type of linguistic material is sometimes described as ‘performance-data’ and may contain features such as hesitations, slips, and non-standard forms which a linguist like Chomsky (1965) believed should not have to be accounted for in the grammar of a language. Although these two views of ‘data’ differ substantially, they are not incompatible, unless they are taken in an extreme form. A discourse analyst may regularly work with extended extracts of conversational speech, for example, but he does not consider his data in isolation from the descriptions and insights provided by sentence-grammarians. It should be the case that a linguist who is  primarily interested in the analysis of discourse is, in some sense, also a sentence-grammarian. Similarly, the sentence-grammarian cannot remain immured from the discourse he encounters in his daily life. The sentence he constructs to illustrate a particular linguistic feature must, in some sense, derive from the ‘ordinary language’ of his daily life and also be acceptable in it. A dangerously extreme view of ‘relevant data’ for a discourse analyst would involve denying the admissibility of a constructed sentence as linguistic data. Another would be an analytic approach to data which did not require that there should be linguistic evidence in the data to support analytic claims. We shall return to the issue of ‘relevant data’ for discourse analysis in Chapter 2. An over-extreme view of what counts as data for the sentence-grammarian was, according to Sampson (1980), noticeable in some of the early work of generative grammarians. Chomsky gave an indication of the narrowness of view which could be taken, when, immediately before his conclusion that ‘grammar is autonomous’, he stated: Despite the undeniable interest and importance of semantic and statistical studies of language, they appear to have no direct relevance to the problem of determining or characterising the set of grammatical utterances. (Chomsky, 1957: 17) The essential problem in an extreme version of the constructed-sentence approach occurs when the resulting sentences are tested only against the linguist's introspection. This can (and occasionally did) lead to a situation in which a linguist claims that the ‘data’ he is using illustrates acceptable linguistic strings because he says it does, as a result of personal introspection, and regardless of how many voices arise in disagreement. The source of this problem, as Sampson (1980: 153) points out, is that the narrow restriction of ‘data’ to constructed sentences and personal introspection leads to a ‘non-testability’, in principle, of any claims made. One outcome of this narrow view of data is that there is a concentration on ‘artificially contrived sentences isolated from their communicative context’(see Preface to Givón (ed.), 1979). Although we shall appeal frequently, in the course of this book, to the insights of sentence grammarians, including those working within a generative framework, we shall avoid as far as possible the methodology which depends on what Lyons (I968) described as regularised, standardised and decontextualised data. Rules versus regularities A corollary to the restricted data approach found in much of Chomskyan linguistics is the importance placed on writing rules of grammar which are fixed and true 100% of the time. Just as the grammarian's ‘data’ cannot contain any variable phenomena, so the grammar must have categorial rules, and not ‘rules’which are true only some of the time. It is typical of arguments concerning the ‘correct rules’ of the language in the Chomskyan approach, and that of most other sentence-grammarians, that they are based on the presentation of ‘example’and ‘counterexample’. After all, a single (accepted) sentence, which is presented as a counterexample, can be enough to invalidate a rule of the categorial type. In this sense, the ‘rules’ of grammar appear to be treated in the same way as ‘laws’in the physical sciences. This restricts the applicability of such rules since it renders them unavailable to any linguist interested in diachronic change or synchronic variation in a language. It should be emphasised that this is an extreme version of the sentence-grammarian's view and one which is found less frequently, in contemporary linguistics, than it was fifteen years ago. The discourse analyst, with his ‘ordinary language’ data, is committed to quite a different view of the rule-governed aspects of a language. Indeed, he may wish to discuss, not ‘rules’ but regularities,simply because his data constantly exemplifies non-categorial phenomena. The regularities which the analyst describes are based on the frequency with which a particular linguistic feature occurs under certain conditions in his discourse data. If the frequency of occurrence is very high, then the phenomenon described may appear to be categorial. As Givón says: what is the communicative difference between a rule of 90% fidelity and one of 100% fidelity? In psychological terms, next to nothing. In communication, a system with go% categorial fidelity is a highly efficient system. (Givón, 1979a: 28) Yet the frequency of occurrence need not be as high as 90% to qualify as a regularity. The discourse analyst, like the experimental psychologist, is mainly interested in the level of frequency which reaches significance in perceptual terms. Thus, a regularity in discourse is a linguistic feature which occurs in a definable environment with a significant frequency. In trying to determine such  regularities, the discourse analyst will typically adopt the traditional methodology of descriptive linguistics. He will attempt to describe the linguistic forms which occur in his data, relative to the environments in which they occur. In this sense, discourse analysis is, like descriptive linguistics, a way of studying language. It may be regarded as a set of techniques, rather than a theoretically predetermined system for the writing of linguistic ‘rules’. The discourse analyst attempts to discover regularities in his data and to describe them. Product versus process The regularities which the discourse analyst describes will normally be expressed in dynamic, not static, terms. Since the data investigated is the result of ‘ordinary language behaviour’, it is likely to contain evidence of the ‘behaviour’ element. That is, unless we believe that language-users present each other with prefabricated chunks of linguistic strings (sentences), after the fashion of Swift's professors at the grand academy of Lagado (Gulliver's Travels,part 3,chapter 5), then we must assume that the data we investigate is the result of active processes. The sentence-grammarian does not in general take account of this, since his data is not connected to behaviour. His data consists of a set of objects called ‘the well-formed sentences of a language’, which can exist independently of any individual speaker of that language. We shall characterise such a view as the sentence-as-object view, and note that such sentence-objects have no producers and no receivers. Moreover, they need not be considered in terms of function, as evidenced in this statement by Chomsky (I968: 62): If we hope to understand human language and the psychological capacities on which it rests, we must first ask what it is, not how or for what purposes it is used. A less extreme, but certainly related, view of natural language sentences can also be found elsewhere in the literature which relates to discourse analysis. In this view, there are producers and receivers of sentences, or extended texts, but the analysis concentrates solely on the product, that is, the words-on-the-page. Much of the analytic work undertaken in ‘Textlinguistics’ is of this type. Typical of such an approach is the ‘cohesion’ view of the relationships between sentences in a printed text (e.g. the approach in Halliday & Hasan, 1976). In this view, cohesive ties exist between elements in connected sentences of a text in such a way that one word or phrase is linked to other words or phrases. Thus, an anaphoric element such as a pronoun is treated as a word which substitutes for, or refers back to, another word or words. Although there are claims that cohesive links in texts are used by text-producers to facilitate reading or comprehension by text-receivers (cf. Rochester & Martin 1977, 1979; Källgren, 1979), the analysis of the ‘product’, i.e. the printed text itself, does not involve any consideration of how the product is produced or how it is received. We shall describe such an approach as deriving from a text-as-product view. This view does not take account of those principles which constrain the production and those which constrain the interpretation of texts. In contrast to these two broadly defined approaches, the view taken in this book is best characterised as a discourse-as-process view. The distinction between treating discourse as ‘product’ or ‘process’has already been made by Widdowson (1979b: 71). We shall consider words, phrases and sentences which appear in the textual record of a discourse to be evidence of an attempt by a producer (speaker /writer) to communicate his message to a recipient (hearer /reader). We shall be particularly interested in discussing how a recipient might come to comprehend the producer's intended message on a particular occasion, and how the requirements of the particular recipient(s), in definable circumstances, influence the organisation of the producer's discourse. This is clearly an approach which takes the communicative function of language as its primary area of investigation and consequently seeks to describe linguistic form, not as a static object, but as a dynamic means of expressing intended meaning. There are several arguments against the static concept of language to be found in both the ‘sentence-as-object’ and ‘text-as-product’approaches. For example, Wittgenstein (1953: 132) warns that ‘the confusions that occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work’. In the course of describing how a sentence-as-object approach, based exclusively on syntactic descriptions, fails to account for a variety of sentential  structures, Kuno (1976) concludes that ‘it is time to re-examine every major syntactic constraint from a functional point of view’. Similar conclusions are expressed by Creider (1979), Givóon (1976, 1979b), Rommetveit (1974) and Tyler (1978). In criticising the text-as-product view of cohesion in text, Morgan (1979) argues that we see a link between a particular pronoun and a full noun phrase in a text because we assume the text is coherent and not because the pronoun ‘refers back’ to the noun phrase. We seek to identify the writer's intended referent for a pronoun, since a pronoun can, in effect, be used to refer to almost anything. That is, what the textual record means is determined by our interpretation of what the producer intended it to mean. The discourse analyst, then, is interested in the function or purpose of a piece of linguistic data and also in how that data is processed, both by the producer and by the receiver. It is a natural consequence that the discourse analyst will be interested in the results of psycholinguistic processing experiments in a way which is not typical of the sentence-grammarian. It also follows that the work of those sociolinguists and ethnographers who attempt to discuss language in terms of user's purposes will also be of interest. In the course of this book, we shall appeal to evidence in the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic literature which offers insights into the way in which discourse, produced in describable contexts for recognisable purposes, is processed and comprehended. On ‘context' We have constantly referred to the ‘environment’, ‘circumstances’ or context in which language is used. In Chapter 2 we shall explore the problem of specifying the relevant context. Here we simply remark that in recent years the idea that a linguistic string (a sentence) can be fully analysed without taking ‘context’ into account has been seriously questioned. If the sentence-grammarian wishes to make claims about the ‘acceptability’ of a sentence in determining whether the strings produced by his grammar are correct sentences of the language, he is implicitly appealing to contextual considerations. After all, what do we do when we are asked whether a particular string is ‘acceptable’? Do we not immediately, and quite naturally, set about constructing  some circumstances (i.e. a ‘context’) in which the sentence could be acceptably used? Any analytic approach in linguistics which involves contextual considerations, necessarily belongs to that area of language study called pragmatics. ‘Doing discourse analysis’ certainly involves ‘doing syntax and semantics’, but it primarily consists of ‘doing pragmatics’. When the principles which we have expounded in 1.3 are placed alongside Morris's definition of pragmatics as ‘the relations of signs to interpreters’(1938: 6), the connection becomes quite clear. In discourse analysis, as in pragmatics, we are concerned with what people using language are doing, and accounting for the linguistic features in the discourse as the means employed in what they are doing. In summary, the discourse analyst treats his data as the record (text) of a dynamic process in which language was used as an instrument of communication in a context by a speaker /writer to express meanings and achieve intentions (discourse). Working from this data, the analyst seeks to describe regularities in the linguistic realisations used by people to communicate those meanings and intentions."
ACA ACA-FSS-004 -0.33 "INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT OR BUSINESS IN this chapter we are concerned with a group of torts the function of which is to protect some of a person's intangible interests — those which may loosely be called his business interests — from unlawful interference. As we have already seen, the law has been less ready to protect these interests from negligently inflicted harm than it has been to protect person and tangible property, but we are now concerned only with liability for intended harm. It is not possible, however, to say simply that whenever one man intentionally causes harm to another that is a tort for, as we have also seen, the mere fact that my motive in performing an otherwise lawful act is to cause damage to another will not of itself make the act tortious. Provided we give a narrow meaning to ‘intention’ the law may well for practical purposes come close to the proposition that it is tortious intentionally to cause damage by any unlawful act, but it has developed by way of distinct, nominate torts and it is necessary to retain that division for the purposes of exposition. Three further prefatory remarks are necessary. First, a great many of the cases in this area of the law are concerned with industrial strife of one kind or another and where this is so the common law has been excluded or modified since 1906 by statutory immunities granted to persons acting in a ‘trade dispute.’ The scope of this immunity has been changed no less than six times in the last 20 years. Since the legislation assumes the existence of the common law background we must first endeavour to ascertain the general principles governing this area of tort and then see shortly how it is affected when there is a trade dispute. Secondly, the torts considered in this chapter may also come into question in cases of alleged unlawful competition between traders, but in practice they are of little significance because of the common law's refusal to adopt any principle of ‘fair competition’ other than the prohibition of obviously unlawful acts like torts and crimes and breaches of contract. Any full study of ‘unfair competition’ would have to take account of the legislation protecting intangible business property like trade marks and patents, and of the  statutory controls over restrictive trading agreements and monopolies, which have little or nothing to do with anything resembling the law of tort. One of the most significant sources of competition law is the EEC Treaty, which may be directly applicable in England and override municipal law. Article 85 prohibits agreements which have the effect of restricting or distorting competition and Article 86 prohibits the ‘abuse of a dominant [market]position.’ It is virtually certain that Article 86 gives rise to a cause of action in English law at the suit of a person damnified by its contravention and it does so on the basis of an action for breach of statutory duty so that the court may award damages. This is a remarkable development and leads to a sharp distinction according to whether the alleged improper trading practice can be shown to be within the purview of the Treaty as affecting ‘trade between member states.’ If it can, the scope of the remedy in damages is immensely wider than under pure municipal law, the modern legislation in which has generally eschewed the private action for damages as a means of enforcement. However, in Bourgoin S.A . v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the Court of Appeal, while regarding itself as bound by the view that Article 86 gave rise to a claim for damages, held that another directly applicable provision, Article 30 (dealing with quantitative restrictions on imports) attracted only the remedy of judicial review. Further consideration of these problems belongs to the study of European law and competition. Finally, the common law contained areas of tortious liability for interference with family and service relationships which were based upon the archaic idea that a man had a proprietary interest in the services of his family and his servants. For example, a husband whose wife was incapacitated by the defendant's negligence had his own action against the defendant for the value of the domestic services which she had formerly rendered and for the loss of her ‘consortium’(or society) and a master had a remedy for ‘enticement’ against one who wrongfully persuaded his servant to leave his employment. Some of these causes of action were restricted by judicial  decision and by legislation in 1970. The Administration of Justice Act 1982 swept away the remaining ones without putting anything in their place. The Act does not as a matter of law preclude a court from holding that an action for negligence lies in favour of a person who could formerly have brought an action based on loss of services but in view of the current law on economic loss it seems most unlikely that such a development will occur. INTERFERENCE WITH A SUBSISTING CONTRACT A commits a tort if, without lawful justification, he intentionally interferes with a contract between B and C,(a ) by persuading B to break his contract with C, or (b ) if by some unlawful act he directly or indirectly prevents B from performing his contract. The existence at common law of the tort of enticement of a servant has already been noticed, but though to modern eyes it involved A persuading B to break his contract with C its historical origins lie more in status than in contract. The origin of a different approach lies in the mid-nineteenth century in Lumley v. Gye . The plaintiff's declaration alleged that he was owner of the Queen's Theatre, that he had contracted with Johanna Wagner, a famous operatic singer, to perform exclusively in the theatre for a certain time and that the defendant, owner of a rival theatre, wishing himself to obtain Miss Wagner's services ‘knowing the premises and maliciously intending to injure the plaintiff…enticed and persuaded [her]to  refuse to perform.’ On demurrer it was held by the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench that while the authorities had until then confined liability for enticement to the relation between master and servant (which that between Lumley and Wagner clearly was not) yet the plaintiff's claim succeeded. The majority held that the case could be decided upon the narrow ground that the action for enticement should be extended beyond the strict relation of master and servant to embrace other contracts for personal services, but support was also given in varying degrees to a broader proposition that a plaintiff might sue for the knowing violation of the security of any type of contractual right. In Bowen v. Hall , on rather similar facts, the Court of Appeal accepted the broader proposition and doubted whether Lumley v. Gye could in fact be based upon the narrower ground of enticement. The rule that inducing or procuring another to break his contract could be actionable at the suit of the other contracting party who suffered damage thereby was only accepted in the face of strong dissent, but the good sense of it is clear. Commercial contractual relations had become valuable rights which could be regarded as entitled to at least some of the protection given by the law to property and while it was argued that the plaintiff ought to be satisfied with his action for breach of contract against the party induced, the latter might be incapable of paying all the damages. The tort has been extended a good deal since Lumley v. Gye and in its modern form its requirements may be summarised as follows. For convenience of exposition reference will normally be made to A's having brought about a ‘breach’ of the contract between B and C and in most of the cases this will have occurred but, as we shall see, there may be liability without an actual breach. Variants of the tort (1) Direct persuasion This is the primary form of the tort exemplified by the facts of Lumley v. Gye itself. A distinction may be taken between persuasion and mere advice, and advice in the sense of ‘a mere statement of, or drawing of the  attention of the party addressed to, the state of facts as they were,’ is not actionable. However, it has been said that advice which is intended to have persuasive effect is not distinguishable from inducement and ‘the fact that an inducement to break a contract is couched as an irresistible embargo rather than in terms of seduction does not make it any the less an inducement.’ It is submitted that the issue is really one of intention and causation. If A's words were intended to cause and did cause B to break his contract with C, then they are actionable by C whatever their form. If so, bearing in mind that intention in this context is not the same as motive and that the tort may be committed without any ill will towards the plaintiff, it is likely to be a rare case in which A's words have had a causative effect on B's conduct and yet A escapes liability on the ground that they were only ‘advice.’ Liability under this head may arise from A's entering into a contract with B knowing that the contract is inconsistent with a prior contract of B's with C as in B. M. T. A. v. Salvadori where A bought a car from B knowing that the sale constituted a breach by B of his contract with C that he would not sell the car within a year. Where the prior contract of B and C is specifically enforceable it would create an equitable interest in the subject-matter in favour of C, which C could enforce against A even if A had only constructive notice of C's rights. In many cases this would render consideration of A's tort liability in a case of actual knowledge otiose, but it seems possible to assert such a claim where there is some additional loss. In the case of land, statutory provisions may give priority to a later contract registered as a land charge even if entered into with knowledge of an earlier, unregistered  transaction, but it seems that this affects only proprietary rights and does not bar an action in tort based on interference with the earlier contract. The other forms of the tort require interference by unlawful means. It is sometimes argued that direct persuasion applied by A to B not to perform his contract is itself the procurement of breach by unlawful means, but the argument is circular and it seems better simply to say that in this form of the tort no use of unlawful means is required. (2) Direct intervention This takes the form of direct action by A on the person or property of B whereby B is disabled from performing his contract with C, as where A physically detains B or steals B's specialised tools without which B cannot carry out his obligation. A similar case exists where A interferes with the subject-matter of the contract in a way which if done by B would amount to a breach of the contract. In G.W.K. Ltd . v. Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd . B manufactured cars and contracted with C that all cars exhibited by B should be fitted with tyres of C's manufacture. At an exhibition, A, who also manufactured tyres, secretly removed C's tyres from B's car and substituted his own. A was held liable to B for trespass to his goods and to C for unlawful interference with his contract with B. However, there must be some conduct which is ‘unlawful’ apart from the intent to injure C, so that, for example , refusing, without any breach of contract, to provide B with supplies that he needs to fulfil his contract with C is no more a tort against C than it is against B, even though A's motive is to injure C. (3) Indirect intervention If, instead of persuading B to break his contract or causing him to do so by direct unlawful action against him, A brings about the breach of the contract between B and C by operating through a third party, X, A may still be liable  to C, provided unlawful means are used. A common example of this form of the tort, though now much restricted by the legislation governing trade disputes, has been the situation where X is B's servant, whom A induces to act in breach of his contract of employment so as to prevent B fulfilling his contract. In J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley , C carried on business hiring out barges to B. These were collected from C and returned to B's watermen. The defendants (A) were officials of a union to which all but a very few watermen belonged and wished to bring pressure on C in connection with a grievance at another company controlled by him. Accordingly, A instructed B's watermen (X) not to man, service or tow barges belonging to C, an embargo which soon brought C's business to a standstill as barges which were out on hire were not returned. In proceedings by C against A for an interlocutory injunction the House of Lords held that a prima facie case had been established that A was liable for procuring breaches by B of the hiring contracts, the unlawful means being the inducement of X to ‘black’ the barges. The unlawful means adopted may be considerably more remote than interference in the contractual relationship between B and his servants. In Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton the International Transport Workers' Federation (1. T.F.) wished to bring pressure on C, owners of the Hoegh Apapa then docked in Liverpool under charter to B and sub-charter to N.L. N.L. had a contract with tug owners to take the Hoegh Apapa out, but as a result of a request from A, an official of I.T.F., the tug crews, in breach of their contracts of employment, refused to move her. It was held that C had made out a prima facie case of unlawful interference with its contract with B, notwithstanding that the direct inducement was not, as in Stratford v. Lindley , one step removed from the contract but three steps removed. In principle there was no distinction between indirect interference at the first stage and such interference at a remoter stage, but the more indirect and remote the interference, the more difficult it may be to establish on the facts that A did intend to interfere with the particular contract relied on by the plaintiff and that that interference was a necessary consequence of A's wrongful act. (a) Unlawful means. In D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. v. Deakin the Court of Appeal was emphatically of the opinion that unless the case was one of direct inducement of B, the tort required the use of some independently unlawful means. The difficulty with this is that it makes the question of A's liability to C turn on what may be a purely technical contravention of the law by A which is of no real concern to C. Further, there are uncertainties in the  meaning of ‘unlawful’ for this purpose. Voices have sometimes been heard to question or deny the validity of this requirement but, while it is probably true to say that this issue has not been central in the cases since Thomson v. Deakin , the necessity for unlawful means has been so consistently repeated in subsequent statements of the law that it is now hopeless to argue the contrary. Nor, despite the arbitrary results capable of being produced by the requirement of illegality, is the law necessarily unwise in displaying this reluctance to extend liability, for if the requirement of illegality were abandoned a much greater burden would have to be placed upon the defence of justification if we were to avoid the intolerable situation that A was liable to C whenever and however he knowingly brought about a breach of a contract between B and C. (b) Inducement by servant. If my servant, acting bona fide within the scope of his authority, procures or causes me to break a contract which I have made with you, you cannot sue the servant for interference with the contract; for he is my alter ego here, and I cannot be sued for inducing myself to break a contract, although I may be liable for breaking the contract. In Said v. Butt the plaintiff wished to get a ticket for X's theatre. He knew that X would not sell him one because they had quarrelled. He therefore persuaded a friend to procure him a ticket without disclosing his identity. When the plaintiff presented himself at the theatre, the defendant, who was X's servant and manager of the theatre, detected the plaintiff and refused to admit him. He sued the defendant for procuring a breach of his contract with X. The action was dismissed because there was no contract, since the identity of the plaintiff was, in the circumstances, material to the formation of the alleged contract; and alternatively, even if there had been a valid contract, the principle stated above would prevent the action from lying. If the servant does not act bona fide, presumably he is liable on the ground that he has ceased to be his employer's alter ego . It is true that even then he might still be acting in the course of his employment, but we must take it that this curious piece of metaphysics exempts the employer from vicarious liability for this particular tort. Intent of the defendant There is no liability under this head for negligently interfering with C's rights under contract. A must have knowledge of the contract between B  and C or act with the intention of bringing about a breach of it. As to knowledge, however, he need not be familiar with all the details of the contract, for otherwise the tort would hardly ever be committed. In Emerald Construction Co. Ltd . v. Lowthian the defendants knew of the existence of the contract between the plaintiffs and their co-contractors but they did not know its precise terms and said that they assumed from their experience in other cases that it could be terminated at short notice. Nevertheless, the evidence showed that the defendants were determined to bring the contractual relationship to an end if they could, regardless of whether it was done in breach or not. The Court of Appeal held that this was sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to an interlocutory injunction. Where a defendant is familiar with the trade in question he may be taken to have knowledge of the existence of a contract even though he cannot identify the other contracting party and even though he may have no direct information about any particular contract at all. In Merkur Island Shipping Corporation v. Laughton the defendants were in fact given a copy of the charter of the trapped vessel before the application for an injunction, but the House of Lords held that they had the requisite knowledge independently of this. Commenting that no one is likely to be better informed than a seamen's union as to the terms on which vessels sailing under flags of convenience were employed, Lord Diplock adopted the words of the Master of the Rolls in the court below: ‘Whatever the precise degree of knowledge of the defendants at any particular time, faced with a laden ship which, as they well knew, was about to leave port, the defendants must in my judgment be deemed to have known of the almost certain existence of contracts of carriage to which the shipowners were parties. The wholly exceptional case would be that of a ship carrying the owner's own goods. Whether that contract or those contracts consisted of a time charter, a voyage charter or one or more bills of lading contracts or some or all of such contracts would have been immaterial to the defendants. Prima facie their intention was to immobilise the ship and in so doing to interfere with the performance by the owners of their contract or contracts of carriage.’ There is, however, no general duty actively to inquire about contracts between others. If A had an honest doubt whether there was a contract  at all between B and C it has been held that this would provide a good defence but if the doubt is whether A's rights or C's under two inconsistent agreements should prevail and A chooses to adopt a course which on one view of the law will undoubtedly interfere with C's rights, it has been said that he must at least show that he was advised and honestly believed that he was entitled to take that course. The meaning of intention gives rise to difficulty. The problem may be illustrated by the county court case of Falconer v. A. S. L. E. F . The defendants called rail workers out on strike and the plaintiff, an ordinary traveller, incurred hotel expenses when he was unable to travel on the journey for which he had bought a ticket. The ‘target’ of the strike action was undoubtedly the railway undertaking but it was obviously a necessary consequence of the strike's having any effect at all that it should lead to interference in the performance of contracts of carriage. The learned judge held that the defendants ‘intended’ to interfere with the plaintiff's contract for the purposes of this tort. However, in Barretts & Baird (Wholesale) Ltd . v. I. P. C.S . Henry J. held that the intention of strikers was to put pressure on their employers to improve their conditions of service and not to disrupt the plaintiffs' contracts, even though that was an unavoidable by-product of the strike. ‘On the evidence the desire to strike was the cause of the injury to the plaintiffs rather than the desire to injure the plaintiffs being the cause of the strike.’ The first view would probably extend the law further than it has commonly been thought to go and would expose strikers having no immunity under trade union legislation to a very wide-ranging liability; on the other hand it is not quite accurate to describe the plaintiffs in these two cases as merely ‘ricochet’ victims for it may be the effect of pressure on the public and customers which causes the employer to succumb to the strikers' demands. However, even on the view that the plaintiff must be the target, no malice or spite is required: apart from the protection of the trade disputes legislation the tort would be committed by a trade union officer calling his members out on strike and he cannot defend himself by arguing that his purpose was the increase of his members' wages: unlike the tort of conspiracy, no predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff is required. There must have been interference with performance of a contract Though the wider wrongs of intimidation and interference with trade by  unlawful means may protect mere expectancies, there is no doubt that for the purposes of the tort we are now considering there must be interference with a subsisting contract between B and C. Hence if the contract allegedly broken proves to be void there is no tort. On the other hand, if the contract is merely unenforceable (e. g. for non-compliance with section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925) then it may well be actionable to procure its breach. The action would not be an indirect method of enforcing the contract against the other contracting party because it lies against a third party and in tort. There need not in all cases be an actual breach of the contract. In Torquay Hotel Co. Ltd . v. Cousins an interlocutory injunction was issued to restrain the defendants from preventing oil companies from carrying out their contracts to deliver oil to the plaintiff's hotel notwithstanding that the contract with the principal supplier of oil contained a clause absolving it from liability if delivery was prevented by circumstances outside its control. Lord Denning M.R. said that liability extends to a case where a ‘third person prevents or hinders one party from performing his contract, even though it be not a breach.’ Whatever the nature of the defendant's conduct this should be so where there is ‘no breach’ only in the sense that an exemption clause in the contract allows a contracting party to escape liability in damages for non-performance of his obligation. Again, where the defendant uses unlawful means to interfere with a contractual relationship there would be no point in requiring any sort of breach, because even interference with prospective, non-contractual advantages by such means may be actionable. However, despite an apparent dictum to the contrary, the Torquay Hotel principle does not, it is submitted, extend to imposing liability in a case where A has, without any unlawful act, done no more than persuade B to exercise an  option open to him under his contract with C, for example, to terminate it by proper notice, for so to hold would be to draw an indefensible distinction between existing, but terminable, relationships and those which are merely prospective, and render it necessary to fall back on the defence of justification in order, for example , lawfully to persuade an employee to change his employment for higher pay. Though Lord Denning's formulation was approved in unqualified terms in Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton that was a clear case of unlawful means and the approval should be read with that in mind. While there may be wrongful interference with contract short of actual breach, there must be interference with performance of the contract. Accordingly, makers and dealers in ‘bootleg’ recordings did not commit this tort even though their activities very seriously affected the value of a contract giving a recording company the exclusive right to exploit live performances. If it is a tort wrongfully to procure a breach of contract is it also a tort to procure the commission of other legal wrongs? There is no need to call up the tort where the legal wrong procured is itself a tort against the plaintiff, for the procurer is then himself liable as a joint tortfeasor; nor, it seems, is there a tort of inducing a breach of trust, because a person who procures such an act becomes himself, by the doctrines of equity, liable as a trustee. Procuring the commission of a criminal offence is not a tort unless the crime also amounts to a tort against the plaintiff, in which case the procurer is a joint tortfeasor. Plaintiff must prove that he has suffered damage as a result of the interference Damage is the gist of the action and without it the plaintiff must fail. Where it is clear that the contract-breaker would have taken the same steps anyway the inducement is not an effective cause of the loss. Where, as will normally be the case, the breach is such as must in the ordinary course of business inflict damage on the plaintiff, he may succeed without proof of any particular damage. Where loss of a pecuniary nature is inferred or proved, the plaintiff may also recover damages for non-pecuniary losses such as injured feelings. Defence of justification It is certain that justification is capable of being a defence to this tort, but what constitutes justification is incapable of exact definition. It has been said that regard must be had to the nature of the contract broken, the position of the parties to the contract, the grounds for the breach, the means employed to procure it, the relation of the person procuring it to the person who breaks the contract, and the object of the person procuring the breach. The advancement of one's own interests will not suffice, nor will that of the interests of one's own group and the defendant cannot escape by showing that his motives are impersonal, disinterested and altruistic. However, in Brimelow v. Casson , persuasion of theatre proprietors by a theatrical performers' protection society to break their contracts with a theatrical manager was justified on the grounds that the wage paid by the manager to chorus girls was so low that they were obliged to supplement it by resort to prostitution. It has been suggested that pressure of a moral obligation as justification is the basis of Brimelow v. Casson , though the case has been said to stand alone and there are conflicting dicta on moral obligation. Presumably there is justification when a doctor urges his  patient to give up a fixed term employment because it is a danger to his health, but what of the tutor who insists that his student give up a vacation job because it will interfere with his studies? The question of justification may also arise where A seeks to assert rights under a contract with B which is inconsistent with another contract between B and C. The question here is whether A has a right equal or superior to that of C and if he has he is justified in persuading B to break his contract with C. So if B enters into a contract on Monday to sell to A for £10,000 and then next day to sell the same property to C for £15,000 A, by persuading B to perform the first contract commits no wrong against C. A will also be justified in reaching an accommodation with B rather than exercising his strict legal rights under the contract. In Edwin Hill & Partners v. First National Finance Corporation a finance company which had a legal charge over B's property to secure a loan came to an arrangement with B whereby they would develop the property themselves rather than exercise their power of sale under the charge. A condition in this arrangement whereby the plaintiff was to be replaced as architect for the scheme did not constitute inducing breach of contract. It has been suggested that the defence of justification can never succeed if unlawful means are used, but this is not certain. INTIMIDATION The word ‘intimidation’ when used in the present context signifies a threat delivered by A to B whereby A intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) either to his own detriment or to the detriment of C. There are thus two forms of the tort, which will be considered separately, but first two general points must be mentioned. (a) ‘Threat’ when used in this connection means ‘an intimation by one to another that unless the latter does or does not do something the former will do something which the latter will not like.’ It is coercive and not mere idle abuse and demands either action or abstention from action on the part of the recipient, so a mere announcement by A that he proposes to strike B is not, for the purposes of the law, a ‘threat’ and cannot of itself give rise to a claim  for damages. On the other hand, the fact that a threat is couched in polite and regretful language does not make it any less a threat, and there is little value in the distinction which has been suggested between a warning and a threat. (b) For a threat as thus defined to be capable of giving rise to an action for damages on the part of anyone it must be a threat of an unlawful act. Anything that I may lawfully do I may also lawfully threaten to do, whatever the motive or purpose of my threat. This is an inescapable result of Allen v. Flood , however unfortunate some of its consequences may be. Accordingly in Hardie and Lane Ltd . v. Chilton , the Court of Appeal held that a threat by A, a trading association, to put B, one of its members, on a ‘stop list’(which would prevent B from getting goods from the members of the association) unless B paid a sum of money for having broken a rule of the association was not a tort. Third-party intimidation Despite some earlier hesitations, it is now certain that A commits the tort of intimidation against C if he threatens B with conduct which is unlawful in relation to B and thereby intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) in a way which causes damage to C. It is not a requirement of this tort that B's conduct be in any way unlawful in relation to C. An old illustration is Garret v. Taylor , where the plaintiff was the lessee of a quarry and alleged that the defendant had ‘disturbed’ his customers and his workmen by ‘threatening to mayhem and vex them with suits if they had brought any stones.’ It was held that on these facts the plaintiff had a good cause of action. In Rookes v. Barnard , decided by the House of Lords in 1964 and the leading authority on this tort, the plaintiff (C) was employed by B.0.A.C. (B) in their design office and the three defendants (A) were officials of the A.E.S.D. Union, two of them also being employees of B.O.A.C. C had been but was no longer a member of the Union. In order to preserve 100 per cent. union membership in the design office and notwithstanding the fact  that a strike would have involved the men in breaches of their contracts of employment, A notified B of the resolution passed by members of the union that if C was not dismissed, ‘a withdrawal of labour of all A.E.S.D. Membership will take place.’ B yielded to this threat and lawfully terminated C's contract of employment. Owing to the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act 1906 C could not rely upon a simple conspiracy to injure but in the House of Lords it was held that he was entitled to succeed on the ground of intimidation. The House held, agreeing with the Court of Appeal, that there is a tort of intimidation, but they also held, reversing the Court of Appeal, that the tort extends to threats by A to break his contract with B and is not confined to threats of criminal or tortious conduct. The essence of the tort lies in the coercion of B, through whom A intentionally inflicts damage upon C, but obviously the law cannot hold every form of coercion to be wrongful. If A tells his grown-up son, B, that he will stop B's allowance if B marries C, A may succeed, as is no doubt his intention, in depriving C of a profitable marriage, but he commits no tort against her, for he is perfectly entitled to stop B's allowance for any reason. The law has therefore adopted the natural dividing line between what is lawful and what is unlawful as against B, the person threatened. The significance of Rookes v. Barnard was that it made it clear that a threat of a breach of contract was unlawful for this purpose but the criticism has been made (and this indeed was the opinion of the Court of Appeal) that if intimidation is extended to threats to break contracts ‘it would overturn or outflank some elementary principles of contract law,’ notably the doctrine of privity of contract, which holds that one who is not a party to a contract cannot found a claim upon it or sue for breach of it. Two answers have been made to the privity of contract objection. First, it can be said not merely that C does not sue for breach of contract between A and B, but that his cause of action actually depends upon the contract not having been broken. It is only because B yields to A's threat that it might be broken that C suffers damage at all. If B does not yield and the contract is broken, then A's threat has not caused C to suffer loss. And if it be objected that A may act first (against B) and explain why afterwards, whereupon B acts to C's detriment, the answer is that it is not A's act which has caused C's loss but the implied threat that it will be repeated. Alternatively it may be said bluntly that in all cases of intimidation, whatever the nature of the threatened act, C's cause of action is wholly independent of B's. C founds not upon the wrong, if any, done to B but on the fact that A has set out to injure him by the use of an unlawful weapon: ‘I can see no difference in principle between a threat to break a contract and a threat to commit a tort. If a third party could not sue for damage caused to him by the former I can see no reason why he should be entitled to sue for damage caused to him by the latter. A person is no more entitled to sue in respect of loss which he suffers by reason of a tort committed against someone else than he is entitled to sue in respect of loss which he suffers by reason of breach of a contract to which he is not a party. What he sues for in each case is loss caused to him by the use of an unlawful weapon against him — intimidation of another person by unlawful means.’ The second approach does more than answer the privity of contract objection: it refutes its basic premise. The point is ‘that the ‘weapon,’i.e . the means, which the defendant uses to inflict loss on the plaintiff, may be unlawful because it involves conduct wrongful towards a third party. There is no reason in principle why such wrongful conduct should include torts and not breaches of contract. One might argue about whether it is expedient for the law to forbid the use of such acts as a means of causing loss, but the privity doctrine is a red herring.’ If one asks why the law should draw the line at threats of breach of contract and not include within the tort of intimidation some threats against B even though the acts threatened are not strictly unlawful, the answer can lie only in the structure of the law. There is a legal ‘chasm’ between, for example, not entering into a contract and breach of an existing contract, which will not easily be bridged. It must, however, be admitted that the above argument, to some extent, depends upon a ‘general’ or even expansive approach to unlawful means in intimidation and in the economic torts as a whole. As a result of the decision of the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ) it is possible (though by no means certain) that threat of a breach of a penal statute does not amount to unlawful means for the purposes of intimidation unless the statute itself gives rise to a civil remedy. If so, it is perhaps  surprising that a threat of a mere breach of contract should give rise to liability. Two-party intimidation There is little direct authority on the position where A threatens B with an unlawful act and thereby intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) in a way which causes loss to B himself. Nevertheless the general opinion seems to be that A commits a tort, certainly where his threat is of violence, and also, since Rookes v. Barnard , where the threat is of any unlawful act within the meaning of that case. On the other hand, in J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley Lord Reid said, ‘A case where a defendant presents to the plaintiff the alternative of doing what the defendant wants him to do or suffering loss which the defendant can cause him to incur is not necessarily in pari casu and may involve questions which cannot arise where there is intimidation of a third person.’ The problems centre round the effect in the two-party situation of a threat of a breach of contract. First, in the two-party situation there is normally a remedy already available to B, while in the three-party situation, if C cannot sue for intimidation, he cannot sue at all. If B is threatened with a breach of contract he may be able to treat the contract as repudiated and sue for anticipatory breach or, of course, he may await the breach and then sue for damages. In fact, the balance of advantage would seem to lie in holding that where A threatens B with a breach of his contract with B, B should be restricted to his contractual remedies. The law should not encourage B to yield to the threat but should seek to persuade him to resist it. In some cases he may be able to obtain an injunction to restrain the breach and in any case he will be adequately compensated by his remedy in damages for breach of contract as his damage can scarcely be other than financial. If B is threatened with a tort it is, of course, equally true that he may bring an action for damages if the tort is committed or bring an action for a quia timet injunction first, but, especially  where the threat is of violence, it is perhaps less realistic to say that these legal remedies afford him adequate protection against the consequences of resistance. From the point of view of policy, therefore, there is much to be said for the view that no independent tort is committed when all that is threatened, in the two-party situation, is a breach of contract, though there is not very much authority for such a proposition. Secondly, since Rookes v. Barnard there has been considerable development in the contractual context of the doctrine of ‘economic duress,’ and in this context it is clear that although a threat to break a contract is ‘illegitimate’it will not amount to duress unless it goes beyond commercial pressure and amounts to ‘coercion of the will.’ In Pao On v. Lau Yiu A threatened that unless B agreed to vary an existing contract between them by giving A a guarantee against loss, A would not fulfil his side of the agreement. A's action on the guarantee succeeded because, although B had acceded to the demand because of fears of delay in litigation and loss of public confidence, the pressure fell short of coercion. Though intimidation was not discussed in the case it cannot be that B could have avoided the binding nature of the contract by the simple device of counterclaiming for damages for intimidation and it seems therefore that for the purposes of intimidation the plaintiff should be required to show unlawful coercion at least of such a degree as would enable him to avoid a contract. If there are any cases in which the victim of unfair pressure may avoid a contract even though the threat is not of unlawful action, there seems no possibility of any concurrent tort liability. CONSPIRACY Though our early law knew a writ of conspiracy, this was restricted to abuse of legal procedure and the action on the case in the nature of conspiracy, which came into fashion in the reign of Elizabeth I, developed into the modern tort of malicious prosecution. Conspiracy as a crime was developed by the Star Chamber during the seventeenth century and, when taken over by the common law courts, came to be regarded by them as not only a crime but also as capable of giving rise to civil liability provided damage resulted to  the plaintiff. As a tort, however, it was little developed until the second half of the nineteenth century and the law remained obscure until the decision of the House of Lords in Crofter Hand-Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd . v. Veitch . Conspiracy remains a crime as well as a tort, but the scope of the crime has been curtailed by statute so that, broadly speaking, the only conspiracies which are now indictable are those to commit a substantive criminal offence, to defraud or to corrupt public morals or outrage public decency. The Act, however, has no effect on civil liability. In fact, even aside from the Act the tort and the crime have cut loose from whatever common origin they had. The tort takes two forms according to whether or not unlawful means are used, though the decision of the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ) may have greatly reduced the importance of ‘unlawful means conspiracy.’ Indeed, the Court of Appeal has indicated that the law laid down in Lonrho has effectively resulted in the unlawful means category no longer existing in any meaningful form; but until the law is finally clarified by the House of Lords it seems justifiable to continue to speak of two forms of the tort. Conspiracy to injure It was firmly established in Crofter Hand-Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd . v. Veitch that if there is a combination of persons whose purpose is to cause damage to the plaintiff, that purpose may render unlawful acts which would otherwise be lawful. The production of Harris Tweed is an industry of the Isle of Lewis. Originally the yarn for the cloth was hand-spun from wool by the crofters of Lewis and was wholly produced in the Isle. By 1930, handspinning of wool had become commercially impracticable and thenceforth many weavers in Lewis imported yarn from the mainland. Five mill owners in Lewis nevertheless spun yarn woven by the crofters. These mill owners alleged that cloth woven on Lewis from mainland yarn could be sold much more cheaply than cloth made from yarn spun in Lewis. It was therefore in their interest to get a minimum price fixed for the cloth. Of the workers in their mills 90 per cent. belonged to the T.G.W.U. and the Lewis dockers were also members of it. The union, with the object of getting all mill workers to be members and of increasing wages, approached the mill owners, who replied that they could not raise the wages because of the competition of the crofters who wove imported yarn. The union officials then put an embargo on the importation of yarn by ordering Lewis dockers not to handle such yarn. They obeyed (without breaking any contract) and  thus injured the trade of seven small producers of tweed who used imported yarn and who sued the officials for conspiracy. It must be stressed at the outset, lest the importance of this form of liability be exaggerated, that the plaintiffs lost their case because the predominant purpose of the embargo was to promote the interests of the union members rather than to injure the plaintiffs, but their Lordships made it clear that if the predominant purpose of a combination is to injure another in his trade or business or in his other legitimate interests then, if damage results, the tort of conspiracy exists. The Crofter principle was applied by the Court of Appeal in Gulf Oil (Great Britain) Ltd . v. Page in granting an interlocutory injunction against a combination to publish a statement defamatory of the plaintiffs even though the statement was admitted to be true and there would, therefore, have been an absolute defence to an action for libel. (1) Purpose The object or purpose of the combination must be to cause damage to the plaintiff. The test is not what the defendants contemplated as a likely or even an inevitable consequence of their conduct; it is ‘what is in truth the object in the minds of the combiners when they acted as they did?’ Malice in the sense of malevolence, spite or ill will is not essential for liability; what is required is that the combiners should have acted in order that (not with the result that , even the foreseeable result) the plaintiff should suffer damage. If they did not act in order that the plaintiff should suffer damage they are not liable, however selfish their attitude and however inevitable the plaintiff's damage may have been. Cases of mixed motive are common enough in individuals, and it is obvious that a combination of persons may have more than one purpose. Where this is so the question must be asked, what was the real or predominant purpose of the combination, and it is to be answered broadly as by a jury or judge of fact. Difficulty may arise where the purposes of the various parties to the combination are different. If each party has his own private end to gain, but yet the joint aim is no more than a desire for prosperity or peace in industry, there is no tort. On the other hand, if one of the parties is  actuated merely by hatred or vindictive spite he may be liable and if the others are aware of this and lend him their assistance they too may thereby become participants in the wrong. Without such knowledge, however, there can be no conspiracy, since the essence of the tort is an unlawful combination. Another way of expressing the central requirement of conspiracy to injure is to say that the law is concerned with the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate purposes, for the former will legalise the infliction of the most catastrophic and inevitable harm to the plaintiff's business. The legitimate purpose of a combination is sometimes spoken of as its justification (and the expression is convenient) but this does not mean that a combination to do an act harmful to the plaintiff is necessarily actionable unless the defendants prove that it was justified. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff throughout. On the other hand, there may obviously be cases where the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by proving that he suffered damage from acts done in combination by the defendants the natural and probable outcome of which was damage to him. The defendants may then have to meet this ‘provisional burden’ by adducing evidence that their purpose was something else and that it was legitimate, without affecting the ‘legal burden’of proof. Precise definition of what is and is not a legitimate purpose is probably not possible, but the fact that we live in a competitive or acquisitive society has led English law, for better or worse, to adopt the test of self-interest or selfishness as being capable of justifying the deliberate doing of lawful acts which inflict harm. Acts done to forward or protect the defendants' trade or business interests are clearly justified, but it is not essential that the interest promoted be a material one. In Scala Ballroom (Wolverhampton) Ltd . v. Ratcliffe the plaintiffs refused to admit coloured persons to their ballroom but they did allow coloured musicians to play in the orchestra. The defendants were members of the Musicians' Union, a union with many coloured members, and they gave notice to the plaintiffs that members of the union would not be permitted to play at the ballroom so long as the colour bar was in operation. An injunction to restrain them from persuading their members not to play there was refused. On the other hand, in Huntley v. Thornton damages were awarded against union officials whose object in keeping the plaintiff out of work was, as Harman J. found, to uphold ‘their  own ruffled dignity…. It had become a question of the district committee's prestige; they were determined to use any weapon ready to their hand to vindicate their authority, and grossly abused the quite frightening powers at their command.’ Other examples of unlawful objects are given by their Lordships in the Crofter case. ‘Mere busybodies’ are probably not protected, nor are those who are induced to join a combination by the payment of money and have no other interest to protect. A combination to compel the plaintiff to pay a debt is apparently unlawful, but where the object is to punish him it is necessary to distinguish between mere vindictive vengeance, which is unlawful, and the purpose of deterring others from similarly offending, which apparently is not. If the object is to increase the effective strength of a trade union, it is lawful. The fact that the damage is disproportionate to the purpose sought to be achieved does not itself render the conspiracy actionable; nor is the court concerned with the expediency or otherwise of the policy adopted by the combiners. (2) Combination There must be concerted action between two or more persons, which includes husband and wife. It seems that there can be no conspiracy between an employer and his employees, at least where they merely go about their employer's business. On the other hand, there might be circumstances where an employer would be vicariously liable for a conspiracy involving his servants provided the other requirements of that form of liability are met. There may be a conspiracy between a company and its directors, whose knowledge and purpose may be imputed to the company. (3) Overt act causing damage In contrast with the crime of conspiracy, an overt act causing damage is an essential element of liability in tort. If, therefore, the acts relied on are incapable of being made part of any cause of action —e.g . evidence given by  witnesses in a court of law — then the tort cannot be made out. A sufficient element of damage is shown where expenses are necessarily incurred by the plaintiff in investigating and counteracting the machinations of the defendants. ‘Unlawful means’ conspiracy This form of the tort involves the use of means which are independently unlawful, though not necessarily tortious. For many years its significance was thought to lie in the fact that, while the combiners had to intend to do an unlawful act, it was not necessary that their purpose should be to injure the plaintiff. However, this may have been overturned by the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ). Shell and others constructed an oil refinery in what was then Southern Rhodesia and Lonrho constructed a pipeline thereto from a port in Mozambique. In November 1965 the government of Southern Rhodesia declared unilateral independence and the United Kingdom passed legislation, the ‘sanctions order,’ making it a criminal offence to supply oil to Southern Rhodesia. No further oil was shipped through Lonrho's pipeline, causing the company loss of revenue. The facts to be assumed by the House of Lords for the purposes of the appeal were that Shell and others had, in breach of the sanctions order, covertly supplied Southern Rhodesia with oil by other means and thereby prolonged the state of illegal independence and the time during which Lonrho's pipeline was out of use . It was clear that the breach of the sanctions order gave rise to no action in tort for breach of statutory duty and a claim based on breach of the sanctions order as ‘unlawful means’ for the purposes of the tort of interference with trade failed. The case was also, however, framed as a conspiracy between Shell and others to contravene the sanctions order. This too failed, on the basis that in unlawful means conspiracy, as in conspiracy to injure, there must be an intent to injure the plaintiff, and conspiracy should not be extended ‘beyond acts done in execution of an agreement entered into by two or more persons for the purpose not of protecting their own interests but of injuring the interests of the plaintiff.’ Accordingly, since the case was to be decided on the factual assumption that the purpose of Shell and others in combining to contravene the sanctions order was to forward their own commercial interests, not injure those of  Lonrho, no matter how likely or foreseeable such injury might be, the claim in conspiracy failed. The meaning of the decision in Lonrho has produced radical differences of opinion in courts here and abroad. One view, which is supported by the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. in the Court of Appeal in Lonrho is that ‘it is sufficient if the [unlawful means]conspiracy is aimed or directed at the plaintiff and it can reasonably be foreseen that it may injure him, and does in fact injure him’ and the Supreme Court of Canada has since stated the law in similar terms in a decision in which Lonrho was considered. This would allow for liability where, for example, A and B conspired by unlawful means with the purpose of driving a competitor C out of the market and thereby monopolising it. If such a case involved no unlawful means their ‘purpose’ would be treated as the advancement of their own self-interest or, to put it another way, their object in removing C from the market would be legitimate. To deny such legitimacy in the case where unlawful means were used would still leave some practical scope for this form of conspiracy. This would not mean that A and B are liable for conspiracy wherever they acted unlawfully with the foreseeable consequence that C suffered loss, for conspiracy should not extend further than the other economic torts (for example, interference with contract by unlawful means) where the predominant view is that this is not sufficient. The plaintiff must be the ‘target’ of the combination but if he is, on this view, the advancement of the defendants' own interests does not justify the use of unlawful means. However, subject to further consideration by the House of Lords, this does not now represent English law. In Metall und Rohstoff v. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc . the allegations pleaded (which the court was required to assume to be true for the purposes of an issue as to service out of the jurisdiction) were as follows. Company A, dealers on the Metal Exchange, knowingly assisted an employee of the plaintiffs to engage in fraudulent trading, the result of which was that Company A became exposed to liabilities of more than £6.5m. To protect itself, Company A, at the instigation of Company B, its parent company, falsely asserted that these accounts were the responsibility of the plaintiffs and wrongfully seized certain metal warrants belonging to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs obtained judgment for £50m. against Company A but recovered only £6.7m. since A was insolvent. A further claim for,inter alia , unlawful means conspiracy was brought against Company B but it was not alleged that the predominant purpose of the conspiracy was to injure the plaintiffs since the defendants were obviously concerned to protect their own position. The Court of  Appeal, after a full consideration of Lonrho , held that the omission of an allegation of intention to injure was fatal to the claim. On this basis, it is hard to see what, if anything, a separate category of unlawful means conspiracy adds to the law and while not perhaps strictly abolished by judicial fiat it may be expected to fade away. Lonrho itself is authority for the view that pursuit of naked self-interest by criminal means can never amount to conspiracy. If the wrong agreed on itself amounts to a tort against the plaintiff perhaps little has been lost by the restriction of conspiracy, for the combination must be carried into effect to cause damage and then the substantive tort is committed. Certainly, it is sometimes said that a claim for conspiracy gives the plaintiff procedural advantages, but the reality of this may turn on how far it is to be held on ordinary principles that instigation or procurement suffices to make a person who does not participate in the act a joint tortfeasor. The restriction of conspiracy might seem to put the plaintiff at a disadvantage if the unlawful means is a tort against a third party or the breach of a contract to which the defendant is not a party but this is not necessarily so, for the defendant's procurement of the commission of the tort may again expose him to liability as a joint tortfeasor, and as to a breach of contract he may anyway have committed the substantive tort of interference with an existing contract. In any event, the emergence of the generic tort of interference with trade or business by unlawful means may have had the effect that most cases which were formerly regarded as unlawful means conspiracies amount to torts even without the element of combination. If there is a lacuna in the law it is probably confined to combinations to do acts which amount to crimes but to no other wrong, but the exclusion of such cases from the tort of conspiracy may be a necessary consequence of Lonrho whatever the mental element required for the tort. Place of conspiracy in the law Conspiracy, it has been said, is a highly anomalous tort, though it has attracted more controversy among academic writers than success in practical application. The central issue has been why the ‘magic of plurality’ should make something unlawful if it is not unlawful when done by one person  alone. Numbers may, of course, bring increased power and in the Crofter case Viscount Maugham said that he had never felt any difficulty in seeing ‘the great difference between the acts of one person and the acts in combination of two or of a multitude,’ but, as Viscount Simon L.C. remarked in the same case: ‘The view that the explanation is to be found in the increasing power of numbers to do damage beyond what one individual can do is open to the obvious answer that this depends on the personality and influence of the individual. In the play, Cyrano de Bergerac's single voice was more effective to drive the bad actor Montfleury off the stage than the protests of all the rest of the audience to restrain him. The action of a single tyrant may be more potent to inflict suffering on the continent of Europe than a combination of less powerful persons.’ The argument from numbers continues to have some appeal in the criminal law but there are now few situations in which there may be an indictment for conspiracy in respect of acts which would not be criminal if done by one person. One day the law may re-examine the place in our law of combination and of the ‘chasm’ between lawful and unlawful acts which exists in the case of an individual, but the latest judicial pronouncements suggest a retreat from liability rather than an advance towards a principle that the intentional infliction of harm without justification is actionable. INTERFERENCE WITH TRADE BY UNLAWFUL MEANS Given that the chasm referred to in the previous paragraph is now unbridgeable is there a more modest general principle that it is a tort intentionally to inflict economic harm on another by use of ‘unlawful means?’ There is now authority that, at least where the harm is interference with trade or business, there is such a tort. Its principal practical impact is to fill in the gaps in the other, long-established torts involving unlawful means by imposing liability where there is no combination, no threat and no interference  with a subsisting contract. In J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley , the facts of which have already been given, two at least of their Lordships considered that if the defendants had used unlawful means —i.e . had committed against the barge hirers the tort of procuring breaches of their contract with their men — the plaintiffs would have had a cause of action not only in respect of breaches of hiring contracts but also in respect of new business they were unable to undertake. ‘In addition to interfering with existing contracts,’ said Lord Reid ‘the defendant's action made it practically impossible for the appellants to do any new business with the barge hirers. It was not disputed that such interference with business is tortious if any unlawful means are used.’ Indeed, this result is an irresistible inference from the acceptance of the tort of intimidation: if it is a tort by A against C to threaten a wrong to B if B continues to deal with C it is hard to see why it should not be equally tortious to inflict harm on C by committing that wrong rather than merely threatening it. More generally, however, this tort has been said to be the genus of which the other unlawful means torts (intimidation and interference with contract and conspiracy where unlawful means are involved) are species. If this is correct, it may be asked why it is necessary to deal with the established, nominate torts at all, to which one can only respond that until the limits of the general tort are clearly established plaintiffs are likely to rely upon as many causes of action as they can, even though from our point of view it is untidy to have two or more torts rather than one. Mental element Like the established economic torts, this is a tort of intention and it is thought that the conduct of the defendant must have the plaintiff as its target though it need not be the predominant purpose in the sense that the defendant needs to be activated by malevolence: the pursuit of self-interest by unlawful means is actionable. Although in some branches of the law a defendant may be treated as intending the known inevitable or likely consequences of his act, that is not so here, for it would stretch the tort too far to impose liability where ‘the reasons which actuate the defendant to use unlawful means are wholly independent of a wish to interfere with the plaintiff's business, such interference being no more than an incidental consequence foreseen by and gratifying to the defendant.’ It must, however, be said that it is by no means crystal clear that this forms the mental element of the ‘species’ torts of unlawful interference with contract and  unlawful means conspiracy (indeed, in the case of the latter it very probably does not) and it is not easy to see how the species can differ in this respect from the genus. Trade or business Beyond the fact that most cases are likely to arise in the context of trade or business it is not apparent why liability should be confined to cases where those activities are interfered with. If it is actionable to use unlawful means to drive away C's prospective customers why should it not equally be actionable to use such means against a person who proposes to buy his house but has not yet signed a contract to do so? If ‘trade or business’ is to be regarded as a requirement of the tort there is a danger that the genus may be narrower than the species. However, it has been suggested that the tort protects only some identifiable legal right. In Lonrho plc v. Fayed the facts which the court was required to assume to be true were that the defendants had made fraudulent misrepresentations about themselves to the Secretary of State in order to influence him not to refer their bid for H.F. Co. to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The plaintiffs contended that they had thereby been deprived of the opportunity to bid for H.F. Co. but pill J. rejected their claim because while the law certainly allowed a freedom to bid for property that was neither a ‘business asset’ of the plaintiffs' nor a legal right which the law would protect. The Court of Appeal, however, declined to deal with this and other points on a striking-out application. Two-party or three-party? As we have seen, at least one form of the established economic torts (intimidation) may exist even though the defendant uses unlawful means directly against the plaintiff rather than against a third party. Is it, therefore, the law that if A steals the tools of a carpenter, B, and locks him up, B may sue for unlawful interference with trade as well as conversion and false imprisonment? Or (assuming breach of contract to be unlawful means) that A is liable in tort if, in order to bring down B, he breaches his contract with him? It is thought that the answer in each case should be ‘no’ because, quite apart from the practical consequences of thus multiplying liability, it would  be a travesty of history to unify these disparate wrongs under one heading of tort. Unlawful means If the law of economic torts is in a mess it is largely because of uncertainty over what constitutes unlawful means. This concept has played the leading role in the development of the modern law but the question of definition has tended to be passed over in the cases with little analysis. Since the broad, ‘genus’ tort is a comparatively recent growth, most of the authorities on unlawful means concern the older, nominate wrongs so that the elements of the former are to some extend rationalisations from the latter and, as we have seen, there is a regrettable element of doubt as to whether ‘unlawful means’bears the same meaning wherever it occurs. Bearing that in mind, it is tolerably clear that conduct which is itself tortious is always unlawful means. The same is probably true of breach of contract but once we move outside the area of wrongs which are civilly actionable in damages the law becomes more uncertain. For example, it has been held that an arrangement void for contravention of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 constitutes unlawful means but this is hard to reconcile with the clear decision in the Mogul case that an agreement in restraint of trade at common law did not. Breach of confidence might qualify as unlawful means (assuming it not to be a tort in itself) but there has been no subsequent support for Lord Denning M.R.'s suggestion that the concept might extend to ‘interference with the press.’ On the other hand, a fraudulent statement to a third party is unlawful means even though the third party could not sue for tort because he suffers no damage. It might seem self-evident that the commission of a crime amounts to unlawful means, but this is not so, at least where the crime is created by statute. This was the first point dealt with by the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ), the facts of which have already been summarised, and in which it was held that the restrictions imposed on the bringing of a direct civil action for breach of a statute could not be outflanked by framing the claim as one for the tort of unlawful interference  with trade. As a matter of strict precedent, however, this aspect of the Lonrho case must have been decided on the same factual assumption as that which governed the conspiracy claim,viz . that while injury to Lonrho's business was foreseeable it was not the defendants' purpose to bring it about. It might, therefore, be open to a court to find liability where a defendant committed a statutory offence as the vehicle for the deliberate infliction of harm upon the plaintiff. In view of the Lonrho decision a similar question might arise with regard to common law crimes which are not also torts in their own right. The closest case on this point is probably Chapman v. Honig where a landlord gave notice to quit to his tenant, the notice being in accordance with the terms of the lease. H's purpose, however, was to punish the tenant for having given evidence (under subpoena ) in an action brought against him by another of his tenants and it followed that the landlord was guilty of a criminal contempt of court. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held, by a majority, that the tenant had no cause of action against the landlord. In coming to this conclusion Pearson L.J. foreshadowed the ‘construction’ approach in Lonrho by treating the common law criminal contempt as if it were created by a hypothetical enactment and asking what intention was to be inferred, with regard to civil liability, from the exercise of the contempt jurisdiction. However, it is not easy to reconcile Chapman v. Honig with Acrow (Automation) Ltd . v. Rex Chainbelt Inc . (where Chapman v. Honig was not cited). Acrow Ltd. obtained an injunction to restrain an American company, S.I., from acting in breach of contract so as to impede Acrow's manufacture of machinery under licence from S.I.S.I. purported to ignore the injunction and instructed Rex Chainbelt, suppliers of components for Acrow's process, to cease supply. This did not involve the breach of any subsisting contract between Acrow and Rex Chainbelt. The Court of Appeal granted an injunction to restrain Rex Chainbelt from obeying S.I. 's instructions: Rex Chainbelt's conduct was interference by unlawful means because it was done in obedience to the orders of S.1. which were in contempt of court. The case may be different from Chapman v. Honig in that the contempt involved was civil not criminal but it is not easy to see  why this should point towards tortious liability. Nor can any distinction be drawn on the basis that there were three persons involved whereas Chapman v. Honig was a ‘two-party’ case, for a true ‘three-party’case only arises where A acts in a manner which is primarily unlawful in relation to B with the purpose of injuring C. In Acrow there was no B. TRADE DISPUTES A general textbook on the law of tort is no place for an extended discussion of the specialised law relating to trade disputes but those disputes have provided most of the ‘raw material’ for the development of the common law and their legal regulation has been so substantially modified by statute since 1906 that some account of the legislative intervention is necessary. Trade Disputes Acts 1906 and 1965 The Trade Disputes Act 1906 was of enormous importance but only the briefest summary of its provisions can be attempted here. The Act: (i) made trade unions completely immune from actions in tort, though it did not affect liability of individuals; (ii) rendered ‘conspiracy to injure’(i.e . without unlawful means) not actionable in the context of trade disputes; (iii) rendered inducement of breaches of contracts of employment not actionable in the context of trade disputes. The Trade Disputes Act 1965 reversed Rookes v. Barnard in trade dispute cases by rendering not actionable a threat to break or induce the breach of a contract of employment. Industrial Relations Act 1971 This Act set out to enlarge the range of civil remedies for wrongful acts done in contemplation or furtherance of ‘industrial disputes,’ but through the new statutory concept of unfair industrial practices, not through the law of tort. Some of these unfair industrial practices were similar to certain varieties of torts and the common law was not wholly abolished. However, the Act was a disastrous failure for political reasons and was repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974. Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 This Act still forms the basis of legal immunities in trade disputes, though  most of the relevant provisions have in fact been inserted by textual amendment by later legislation. Protection is granted, in the context of a trade dispute, to interference with contract (and not merely a contract of employment), to intimidation or conspiracy to injure and to interference with trade by unlawful means but by the Employment Act 1980 this protection was to a large extent withdrawn in case of‘secondary action.’ Present law (1) Trade unions It will have been observed that nearly all the cases in this chapter arising from industrial disputes have taken the form of actions against individual workers or trade union officials. This is because for many years trade unions themselves were immune from actions in tort. This was not based on the fact that a trade union was an unincorporated body, for in Taff Vale Railway Co . v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants the House of Lords held that a union registered under the Trade Union Act 1871 was enough of a legal entity to be sued in tort. The Taff Vale case was reversed by section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906. After a brief period during which a registered trade union was a corporate body under the Act of 1971, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 restored the immunity, though liability was imposed (where there was no trade dispute) for certain torts causing personal injury or breaches of duty connected with the union's property. It remains the law that a trade union is not, and is not to be treated as if it were, a body corporate, but a much wider measure of tort liability is now imposed by the Employment Act 1982. The central difficulty is that of attributing responsibility to the ‘centre’ in such a ‘devolved’organisation as the typical trade union, bearing in mind the likelihood that ‘unofficial action’will be taken at individual plant level without prior consultation with the union's central organs. The fundamental proposition of the 1982 Act is that the immunity of trade unions in tort is totally abolished, though the union enjoys the same defences as an individual where action is taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. However, the range of the union's responsibility for the acts of its officers and members differs according to the nature of the claim which is brought against it. According to section 15 of the 1982 Act, if the union is sued for inducing breach of or interfering with contract, or for intimidation by threats to interfere with contract, or for conspiracy to commit these torts, then the act in question  shall be taken to have been done by the union only if it was authorised or endorsed by a ‘responsible person,’ which means the principal executive committee, any person authorised by the rules to endorse acts of the kind in question, the president or general secretary, any other employed official, or any committee to which an employed official reports, but an act by an official or a committee to which he reports shall not be taken as authorised or endorsed if the official or committee was prevented from authorising or endorsing the act by union rules or if the act has been repudiated by the president or general secretary. In all other cases it would seem that the union's responsibility for the acts of an individual are to be determined by the general law of master and servant or agency. Where the union's liability arises in respect of personal injury caused by negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, or in respect of ownership or possession of property, there is no limit on its amount, but in other cases there are financial limits according to the size of the union. However, damages are not recoverable by enforcement against ‘protected property’(which includes a political fund which is not available for financing strikes and provident benefits fund). Actions for damages (as opposed to injunctions) have not so far figured largely in litigation against individuals caused by industrial action; the limits to union liability set by the 1982 Act are low in relation to the loss that may be suffered and the very large fines imposed for contempt by disobedience to injunctions have probably been a more powerful sanction. (2) Liability of individuals An individual (e.g . a shop steward) is liable for unprivileged acts in the course of a trade dispute, whether or not a trade union is liable. The extent of individual immunity in this context is found in section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as limited, in the case of ‘secondary action’ by the Employment Act 1980. Section 13 in its present form reads as follows: ‘(1) An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort on the ground only —(a) that it induces another person to break a contract or interferes or induces any other person to interfere with its performance; or (b) that it consists in his threatening that a contract (whether one to  which he is a party or not) will be broken or its performance interfered with, or that he will induce another person to break a contract or to interfere with its performance. (4) An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure the doing of any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort if the act is one which, if done without any such agreement or combination, would not be actionable in tort.’ (a) Trade dispute. In order to gain the protection of section 13, the act done by the defendant must be ‘in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.’ This concept, the so-called ‘golden formula,’ is defined in section 29 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as amended by the Employment Act 1982. It means a dispute between workers and their employer which relates wholly or mainly to one or more of the following: terms and conditions (including physical conditions) of employment: engagement, non-engagement, termination or suspension of employment or of duties of employment; matters of discipline; membership or non-membership of a trade union; facilities for union officials; machinery for negotiation or consultation and other procedures, including recognition of unions. However, by section 10 of the Employment Act 1988 the immunity is withdrawn where the reason or one of the reasons for which the act is done is the fact or belief that the employer is employing non-union labour. Action in support of the ‘closed shop,’ the source of many trade dispute cases, is no longer lawful. A crucial amendment by the 1982 Act was the removal of section 29(4), which provided that a dispute to which a trade union was party should be treated as a dispute to which workers were parties. For this reason, union officials cannot claim the protection of section 13, if, as part of a wider dispute, they initiate industrial action against an employer who is in harmony with his workers. If, however, some support for the union's policy can  be mustered among the plaintiff employer's workers the range of matters covered by section 29 is very wide. In B.B. C . v. Hearn the defendants, in order to protest against apartheid, threatened to instruct the members of their union to commit breaches of contract in relation to broadcast by satellite to South Africa of the 1977 Cup Final. In proceedings for an interlocutory injunction the Court of Appeal held it unlikely that there was a trade dispute, but Roskill L.J. recognised that the situation might well have been different if, instead of the defendants simply threatening to ‘black’ the broadcast they had gone to the B.B.C. and said ‘We wish it to be established as part of our conditions of employment that we are not required to work on broadcasts to South Africa.’ This received the approval of Lord Diplock in N. W. L. Ltd . v. Woods but it has since been remarked that a ‘trade union cannot turn a dispute which in reality has no connection with terms and conditions of employment into a dispute connected with terms and conditions of employment by insisting that the employer inserts appropriate terms into the contracts of employment into which he enters.’ An act is ‘in furtherance’ of a trade dispute when the doer genuinely believes it will assist the cause in support of which it is done: the House of Lords has emphatically rejected the addition of any requirement that the act be ‘not too remote’or ‘reasonably likely to succeed.’ (b) Interference with subsisting contract and intimidation. Section 13(1) protects the most obvious forms of trade union coercion,i.e . inducing breaches of contract and threats to do so. There would, for example, be no liability on facts such as those in Rookes v. Barnard if the threats had been made in support of a wage claim. The protection is not confined to interference with contracts of employment but where the contract affected is not a contract of employment, there are restrictions on the use of ‘secondary action.’ The word ‘only’ is important, for the protection is thereby confined to cases in which the defendant commits no other, incidental tort to procure the breach of contract. If,e.g . he uses words amounting to defamation he is not protected. (c) Conspiracy. Section 13(4) removes ‘conspiracy to injure’ from the  field of trade disputes because it involves an action which would not be actionable in tort if done without agreement or combination. The scope of ‘unlawful means’ conspiracy is also restricted by the requirement that the act should be one which would be actionable in tort if done by one person. Thus an agreement to break a contract may not be actionable. An agreement to induce a breach of contract might be thought to fall outside this protection because inducement is a tort if committed by one person, but this is not so if the inducement is protected by section 13(1). (d) Unlawful interference with trade. This tort is not directly referred to in section 13, except in so far as the ‘nominate’ torts above are species of which it is the genus. Obviously it should not be possible to evade the statutory immunity by pleading the genus and relying on the species as unlawful means, but there would seem to be no statutory protection if the unlawful means take any other form such as nuisance or trespass. A trade union or union official calling its members out on strike is therefore protected but it has been said to be arguable that an individual striker has no protection against a claim that he uses unlawful means when he withdraws  his labour because this situation does not appear to fall within section 13(1). (e) Secondary action. The complex provisions of section 17 of the Employment Act 1980 restrict the scope of the section 13 immunity for secondary action.’ Nothing in section 13 is to prevent an act from being actionable in tort on a ground specified in section 13(1) where (a ) the contract interfered with in respect of which the action is brought is not a contract of employment and (b ) there has been secondary action which does not satisfy the requirements of section 17. Secondary action is action interfering with a contract of employment in one of the ways specified in section 13(1) where the employer under that contract is not a party to the trade dispute. Hence if, in pursuance of a trade dispute between A and C, A induces the employees of B, with whom C has a contract, to break their contracts of employment with a view to bringing about a breach of the contract between B and C the action is presumptively unlawful. However, this is not the end of the matter for the scope of this withdrawal of immunity is limited by the remainder of section 17, which provides three routes through which secondary action may finally be held to be not unlawful. The principal provision is section 17(3) which provides that secondary action is not unlawful it — ‘(a) the purpose or principal purpose of the secondary action was directly to prevent or disrupt the supply during the dispute of goods or services between an employer who is a party to the dispute and the employer under the contract of employment to which the secondary action relates; and (b) the secondary action (together with any corresponding action relating to other contracts of employment with the same employer) was likely to achieve that purpose.’ This was considered by the House of Lords in Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton where, it will be remembered, the I.T.F. union, in dispute with Merkur Island, a flag of convenience shipowner, induced tug-boat crews to refuse, in breach of their contracts of employment, to move Merkur Island's vessel, thereby interfering with the charter of the  vessel to Leif Hoegh. Having said that any removal of the immunity by section 17 enured for the benefit not only of the person against whom the secondary action was taken but also for that of the employer who was party to the trade dispute, Lord Diplock held that the action by I.T.F. was not protected. Merkur Island were not parties to any contract for the supply of towage services, so it was not possible to say that the purpose of the action was to prevent the supply of services between an employer who was party to the dispute (Merkur Island) and the employer under the contract of employment to which the secondary action related (the tug owners). Similar provisions are contained in the Act to govern secondary action aimed at disruption of supply between any person and an associated employer of the employer party to the dispute where the goods or services are in substitution for goods or services which but for the dispute would have fallen to be supplied to or by the employer who is party to the dispute. (f) Picketing. Picketing in various forms has shown itself to be one of the most effective forms of industrial action. At common law it may be unlawful as amounting to a trespass to the highway, or a public or private nuisance, or as involving the inducement or procuring of a breach of contract. However, under section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 it is lawful for a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute to attend at or near his own place of work ‘for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.’ ‘Secondary action’(e.g . persuading a supplier's lorry driver not to deliver so as to disrupt a commercial contract) is protected if the attendance is lawful under the 1974 Act, but there is no protection for ‘secondary picketing,’i. e . attendance at the premises of the employer's supplier or customer. (g) Ballots. Yet another basis for the removal of the immunity granted by the 1974 Act is to be found in Part II of the Trade Union Act 1984. This requires action taken by a trade union to be supported by a majority in a  secret ballot of all those reasonably expected to take part in the action, and in view of the practicalities of organising a ballot and the fact that advance approval of action is valid for only four weeks puts a serious constraint upon the taking of effective action even where that has overwhelming support. Detailed modifications of the ballot procedure are to be found in sections 12 to 18 of the Employment Act 1988. (h) Injunctions. Where an employer is the victim of industrial action his primary purpose in embarking on litigation is usually (and this is likely to remain the case notwithstanding the extension of tort liability to trade unions) to get an injunction. Since an injunction may be granted on an interlocutory basis pending trial (which may not take place for many months) and, in cases of great urgency, on an ex parte basis, it is clear that there is a possibility of the union side being robbed of the initiative in an industrial action. To meet this point, section 17 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 contains two provisions. First, where an application for an injunction is made ex parte and the defendant claims, or in the opinion of the court would be likely to claim, that he acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, the court shall not grant the injunction unless satisfied that all steps which in the circumstances were reasonable have been taken with a view to securing that notice of the application and an opportunity of being heard with respect to the application have been given to him. This reduces the risk of the defendants in a ‘labour injunction’ case being taken unawares, but contains nothing about how the court should proceed when both parties are before it. At the time when the 1974 Act was passed it was thought that the issue on an application for an interlocutory injunction was whether the plaintiff had established a prima facie case, but in American Cyanamid Ltd . v. Ethicon Ltd . the House of Lords held that the test was rather more favourable to the plaintiff, was there ‘a serious question to be tried?’ To meet this development section 17(2) was inserted into the Act and provides that where an application is made for an interlocutory injunction and the party against whom it is sought claims that he acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, the court shall, in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant the injunction, have regard to the likelihood of that party's succeeding at the trial of the action in establishing the matter which would afford a defence under the Act. Under the American Cyanamid decision the court must ask itself whether the plaintiff has shown (a ) a serious question to be tried and (b ) that the ‘balance of convenience’ is in his favour. It is not very clear whether section 17(2) adds a third element or is subsumed in (b ), but it is clear that it was intended to be more difficult to obtain an interlocutory injunction in trade  dispute cases than in others. If the affidavits suggest that it is more likely than not that the defendant would succeed in establishing a statutory immunity that is a weighty factor in favour of refusing to grant an injunction. It has been suggested that now that unions (and not merely officials) may in certain circumstances be liable in damages for unlawful industrial action it is more likely that an employer will pursue his claim to a full trial and there is less reason to refuse an interlocutory injunction in trade dispute cases; but it has also been said that the ‘right to strike’ is a valuable (indeed essential) element in the system of collective bargaining and that it ‘should not be rendered less valuable than Parliament intended by too fanciful or ingenious a view of what might develop into a serious issue to be tried.’"
ACA ACA-J57-003 -0.85 "PAST AND PRESENT Historical Perspective and Contemporary Problems A NUMBER OF INTRODUCTION TEXTS on British politics do not have chapters devoted specifically to political history. The omission is a surprising one. When the proposal for this book was under consideration by the publishers, a number of American professors were asked for their comments. One responded with this advice: ""Make sure you incorporate as much historical detail as possible. American students don't know much about British history."" It was a shrewd response. The need for such detail, however, is not confined to Americans interested in the subject; it encompasses all those who seek to make some sense of the institutions and complex relationships that form the British polity in the 1980s. There has been no point in British history at which the prevailing method of government has been completely swept away, allowing those in power to sit down and create from first principles a new and clearly delineated form of government. The country has witnessed continuous and sometimes dramatic change. In the past 300 years alone, the nation has experienced industrialization, the advent of democracy, and the introduction and growth of the welfare state — yet the changes have never been such as to be described as revolutionary. They have been built upon and have adapted that which already existed. The body politic may have undergone radical surgery and it may have aged considerably, but it has continued to endure. What then, are the significant features of British history that help us  understand the contemporary political system and the political culture. Limitations of space preclude a lengthy dissertation on what is a vast subject. That vastness is apparent when put in comparative perspective. The Magna Carta, for instance , was signed more than two centuries before Christopher Columbus set sail. A Parliament was summoned more than 500 years before the United States Congress first assembled. And an American president, unlike a British monarch, cannot trace his presidential forebears back more than 1,000 years. Nonetheless, it is possible to provide a brief but structured sketch that furthers our understanding of contemporary British politics. This can be done under two headings: one is the emergence of parliamentary government, and the other is the development of the welfare state and the managed economy. The structure and relationships of the contemporary organs of government can be understood only in historical context. A study of the emergence of the welfare state highlights the increased demands and responsibilities borne by government. Both studies provide a necessary background to understanding some of the problems now faced by government. They serve also to highlight certain features of the political culture. One of the essential features of the British Constitution is a parliamentary government under a limited, or symbolic, monarchy. The formal elements of this type of government will be more fully outlined in the next chapter. For the moment, what concerns us is that this government is the product of change extending over several centuries, coming to fruition only in the past century. Its development has sometimes been characterized as being evolutionary, but in practice, it is the outgrowth of piecemeal change. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The Emergence of Parliamentary Government Let us begin in the thirteenth century. Traditionally, the sovereign power in England resided in the monarch. Nonetheless, the king was expected to consult with his tenants-in-chief (the earls, barons, and leading churchmen of the kingdom) in order to discover and declare the law and to have their counsel before any levies of extraordinary taxation were made. This expectation was to find documented expression in the Magna Carta of 1215, by which the King recognized it as a right of his subjects ""to have the Common Council of the Kingdom"" for the assessment of extraordinary aids — that is, taxation. Such consultation was undertaken through a Great Council, from which evolved what was to be recognized as a parlement or Parliament. The Great Council itself was essentially the precursor of the House of Lords. The House of Commons evolved from the summoning to  council, in the latter half of the thirteenth century on a somewhat sporadic basis, of knights and burgesses as representatives of the counties and towns. At various times in the fourteenth century the Commons deliberated separately from the Lords, and there developed a formal separation of the two bodies. During the period of the Tudor monarchs in the sixteenth century, Parliament acquired enhanced status. It was generally supportive of the monarch but became more powerful because of the dependence upon it for that support, especially during the reign of Elizabeth I. The relationship between Crown and Parliament under the subsequent Stuart dynasty was one of conflict. The early Stuart kings James I and Charles I sought to assert the doctrine of the divine right of kings and to deny many of the privileges acquired or asserted by Parliament. This conflict was to lead to the civil war and the beheading of Charles I in 1642. With the abolition of the monarchy came a brief period of rule by a Council of State elected by what was termed the Rump Parliament. (Some attempts were actually made to formulate a form of written constitution, but they came to nothing.) Rule by the Council of State was succeeded by Oliver Cromwell's unsuccessful military dictatorship, and in 1660 Charles' son returned to assume the throne as Charles II. The period between 1642 and 1660 proved an aberration in British history. The Restoration witnessed an attempt to return, unconditionally, to the country's position as it was at the beginning of 1642. Through this attempt the Restoration lent itself to a repetition of the earlier struggle between King and Commons. Relations between the two gradually deteriorated during the reign of Charles II and became severe in the reign of his successor, James II. James sought to reassert the divine right of kings, and Parliament combined against him. In 1688 James fled the country. At the invitation of Parliament, the throne was taken by William and Mary of Orange, James' son-in-law and daughter. The new occupants of the throne owed their position to Parliament, and the new relationship between them was asserted by statute in the Bill of Rights. Although the Bill of Rights was important for enumerating various ""Liberties of this Kingdom"" (Some of which were to be similarly expressed during the following century in the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution), its essential purpose was to assert the position of Parliament in relation to the Crown. The raising of taxes or the dispensing of laws without the assent of Parliament was declared to be illegal. The monarch was expected to govern, but to do so only with the consent of Parliament. The Act of Settlement of 1701, which determined the succession to the throne, affirmed that the laws of England ""are the Birthright of the People thereof and all the Kings and Queens who shall ascend the Throne of this Realm ought to administer the Government of the same according to the said Laws and all their Officers and Ministers ought to serve them respectively according to the same.""  The monarch thus became formally dependent on Parliament for  consent to the raising of taxes and for the passage of legislation. In practice, he or she became increasingly dependent also on ministers for advice. The importance of ministers grew especially in the eighteenth century. The Hanoverian kings were not uninterested in political life but they had difficulty comprehending the complexities of domestic and foreign affairs. According to the historian J. H. Plumb, both George I and George II were ""crassly stupid"" and ""incapable, totally incapable, of forming a policy.""  During the period of their reigns, the leading body of the king's ministers, generally known as the cabinet, began to meet without the king being present. The period also witnessed the emergence of a minister who was to become popularly known as the prime minister. (Not until the twentieth century was the office of prime minister to be mentioned in a statute.) The relationship among Crown, ministers, and Parliament in that century was one in which the king relied on his ministers to help formulate policy. Those ministers were chosen by the king on the basis of his personal confidence in them, and they remained responsible to him. They also were responsible to Parliament in order to achieve their ends, a fact recognized by both the king and his ministers. Nonetheless, parliamentary support was not difficult to obtain; the king and his ministers had sufficient patronage and position usually to ensure such support. A ministry that enjoyed royal confidence could generally take the House of Lords for grated, and provided it did not prove incompetent or seek to impose excessive taxation, ""its position was unassailable in the Commons.""  The position was to change significantly in the nineteenth century. Britain underwent what has been popularly referred to as an industrial revolution in the period from the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the nineteenth. Seymour Martin Lipset has characterized the United States as the ""first new nation,"" but Britain has been described as ""the first industrial nation.""  Industry became more mechanized, improvements took place in agricultural production techniques, and there were improvements in transport and in the organization of trade and banking. There was a notable growth in the size of cities, particularly in the early part of the nineteenth century. Men of industry and commerce began to emerge as men of some wealth. In 1813, Robert Owen referred to the ""working class,"" a term brought into common speech by Lord Brougham. By the 1830s, a nonlanded middle class, artisans, and an industrial workforce were important constituents of the country's population. Parliament remained dominated by the aristocracy and by the landed gentry. Representation in the House of Commons was heavily weighted in favor of the rural counties. Some parliamentary constituencies had only a handful of electors: known as ""rotten boroughs,"" they were often in the pocket of an aristocrat or local landowner. Pressure for some parliamentary reform, with a redistribution of seats and a widening of the franchise, began to develop. It was argued that a Parliament full of men of wealth and property  was unlikely to view industry, trade, and agriculture from the point of view of the laboring classes. Rotten boroughs were criticized as being used by the ministry to help maintain a majority. Unrest in a number of areas, both agricultural and industrial, and the French Revolution of 1830 (a spur to radical action) increased the pressure for change. One political group in particular, the Whigs, who had been the ""outs"" in politics for the 25 years prior to 1830, began to see the need for some response to this pressure. The concession of some parliamentary reform was seen as necessary in order to prevent worse happenings. The result was to be the Reform Act of 1832. The Reform Act, introduced, ironically, by the most aristocratic government of the century, reorganized parliamentary constituencies and extended the franchise. The electorate increased in size from a little under 500,000 to 813,000 electors. Although much remained the same as before — the new electorate constituted but one-thirtieth of the population, 31 boroughs still had fewer than 300 electors in each, voting remained by open ballot (secret ballots were considered rather un-English), and the aristocracy still held great sway politically — the act precipitated important changes both within and outside the House of Commons. The redistribution of seats and the extension of the franchise helped loosen the grip of the aristocracy and of ministers on the House of Commons. The size of the new electorate encouraged the embryonic development of political organizations. Members of Parliament (MPs) became less dependent on aristocratic patrons without acquiring too great a dependence on the growing party organizations. The result was to be a House of Commons with a greater legitimacy in the eyes of MPs and electors and one with an ability to assert itself in its relationship with government. The House proved willing to amend or reject legislation put before it as well as to remove individual ministers and on the occasion the government itself. In his classic work on the constitution, Walter Bagehot attached much importance to this ""elective function"" ; The House of Commons, he declared, was""a real choosing body: it elects the people it likes. And it dismisses whom it likes too."" Debates in the House really counted for something and, with the exception of the period from 1841 to 1846, party cohesion was almost unknown. The House of Commons did not itself govern, but government was carried on within the confines of its guidance and approval. The period after 1832 witnessed also important changes in the relationships within and among the different elements of Crown, government, and Parliament. The monarch retained the formal prerogative power to appoint the prime minister, but the changed political circumstances essentially dictated that the person chosen should be able to command a majority in the House of Commons. Royal favor ceased to be an essential condition for forming the Government. Within Parliament, the relationship between the two Houses also changed. Members of the House of Lords sat by virtue of birth, holding hereditary peerages. The acceptance of the Commons as the  ""representative"" chamber undermined the authority of the peers to challenge or negate the wishes of the other House. After the 1830s, the Lords tended to be somewhat restrained in their attacks on government measures.  ""This followed,"" writes Mackintosh,""from the view that while a ministry retained the confidence of the elected representatives it was entitled to remain in office. The peers on the whole accepted these assumptions, though many found the explicit recognition of the situation hard to bear."" The Lords' remaining authority was in practice to be removed in consequence of the 1867 Reform Act, though not until the twentieth century was the House forced formally to accept its diminished status. Whereas the 1832 Act helped ensure the dominance of the House of Commons within the formal political process, the passage of the Reform Act of 1867 began a process of the transfer of power from Parliament to Ministers. The act itself was the product of demands for change because of the limited impact of the 1832 Act and because of more immediate political considerations. Its effect was to increase the size of the electorate from 1,358,000 to 2,477,000. (The number had grown since 1832 because of increased wealth and population.) Other significant measures followed in its wake. Secret voting was introduced by the Ballot Act of 1870. Other acts sought to prohibit as far as possible corrupt practices and limited the amount of money a candidate could spend on election expenses. Single-member districts (known in Britain as constituencies) of roughly equal electoral size were prescribed as the norm. The 1884 Representation of the People Act extended the franchise to householders and tenants and to all those who occupied land or tenements with an annual value of not less than 10 pounds. The effect of the act was to bring into being an electorate in which working men were in a majority. The consequence of these developments was to be party government. The size of the new electorate meant that the voters could be reached only through some well-developed organization, and the result was to be the growth of organized and mass-membership political parties. The Conservative National Union and the National Liberal Federation were formed in order to facilitate and encourage the support of the new electors. However, contact with the voters was insufficient in itself to entice their support. Not only had a large section of the population been enfranchised, it was a notably different electorate from that which had existed previously. The new class of electors had different and greater demands than those of the existing middle-class electors. If the votes of working men were to be obtained, the parties had to offer them something. And the parties could fulfil their promises only if they presented a uniform program to the electorate and achieved a cohesive majority in the House of Commons to carry through that program. What this was to produce was a shift of power away from the House of Commons to the cabinet and to the electorate, with political parties serving as the conduit for this transfer. The electorate proved too large and too politically unsophisticated to evaluate the merits of an individual MP's behaviour. Political parties provided the labels with which electors could identify, and elections became gladiatorial contests between parties rather than between individual candidates. The all-or-nothing spoils of an election victory and the method of election encouraged (if it not always produced) a contest between two major parties. And having voted for party candidates, the electors expected the members returned to Parliament to support the program offered by their leaders at the election. Party cohesion soon became a feature of parliamentary life. The House of Commons in effect lost two of the most important functions ascribed to it by Bagehot, those of legislation and of choosing the government: the former passed to the cabinet and the latter to the electorate. The cabinet constituted the leaders of the party enjoying a parliamentary majority. It assumed that initiative for the formulation and introduction of measures of national policy and became increasingly reluctant to be over-ruled by the House. The growth in the number and complexity of bills further limited the influence of the individual MP. Increasingly, his role became one of supporting his leaders. The cabinet had previously rested its authority on the support of the House; now it derived its authority from the electors. As Mackintosh states,""The task of the House of Commons became one of supporting the Cabinet chosen at the polls and passing its legislation… By the 1990s, the Cabinet dominated British government."" Further modifications and addenda took place in the first half of the twentieth century. The House of Lords was forced by statute in 1911 to accept its diminished status. The franchise was variously extended, most notably to half the population previously excluded because of their sex. The monarch's political influence further receded. The growth and increasing economic weight of groups generated more extensive and complex demands of government. And the size of government grew as its responsibilities expanded. Basically, though, the essential features of the political system were those established in the preceding century. The responsibility for making public policy rested with the government, a government derived from and resting its support upon a political party. That same party's majority in the House of Commons ensured that the government's measures were approved. Formal and political constraints limited the effect of any opposition from the House of Lords. The monarch gave formal assent to any legislative measure approved by the two houses. Thus, within the formal framework of deciding public policy, the government was dominant. The role of Parliament became largely but not wholly one of legitimating the measures put before it. For the monarch, that became the exclusive role (that is, in respect of legislation). Government, as we shall see, operated within a political environment that imposed important constraints, but the limitations imposed formerly by Parliament and the monarch were largely eroded. Britain  retained a parliamentary form of government, but what that meant was not government by Parliament but government through Parliament. To comprehend some of the problems faced by British government in the 1980s it is necessary to know not only the structure and relationships of the political system but also the popular expectations and the burden of responsibilities borne by government. Those expectations and responsibilities have not been static. Just as the governmental structure has been modified in response to political demands, so the responsibilities of government have grown as greater social and economic demands have been made of it. The Welfare State and the Managed Economy Toward the end of the nineteenth century and more especially in the twentieth, the responsibilities of government expanded. In part this was attributable to the growth of the Empire. It was also attributable to the increasing demands and expectations of the newly enfranchised working population. Government began to conceive its duties as extending beyond those of maintaining law and order and of defending the realm. The statute book began to expand, with the addition of measures of social reform. Various such measures were enacted in the years prior to 1867, though the most notable were to be enacted in the remaining decades of the century. They included measures to limit working hours for women and children, to improve housing and public health, to make education for children compulsory, to provide for the safety of workers (including the payment of compensation by employers in the event of accidents at work), and even to extend the right to strike. Such measures, exploited for electoral advantage, were within the capabilities of the government to provide. They did not create too great an economic burden; they were not themselves economic measures. The growth of expectations and the greater willingness of government to intervene in areas previously considered inviolate was to be continued and become more marked in the twentieth century. The general election of 1906 was something of a watershed in British politics. It was the first election to be fought essentially on national issues and it witnessed the return not only of a reforming Liberal government but also, and in some respects more significantly, of 27 Labour MPs. The Labour party had been created for the purpose of ensuring working-class representation in Parliament, and from 1906 onward class became a significant influence in voting behavior. The nature of electoral conflict changed as the Labour party succeeded the Liberal as the main opposition party to the Conservatives. The franchise was further extended, notably in 1918 and 1928, and new expectations were generated by the experience of the two world wars. During the First World War (1914-1918), socialists within the Labour party argued the case for the conscription of wealth (public ownership) to  accompany the conscription of labor (the drafting of men into the armed forces). Politicians fueled rather than played down the belief that Britain should become, in the words of one politician, ""a land fit for heroes"" once ""the war to end all wars"" was won — in other words, that provision should be made for those who had fought for King and Country. The period of the Second World War (1939-1945) witnessed a significant shift of attitudes by a sizable fraction of the electorate. One informed estimate was that by December 1942, about two out of every five people had changed their political outlook since the beginning of the war. The direction in which opinion was moving was toward the left of the political spectrum. There was a reaction against (Conservative) government unpreparedness for war in the 1930s and against those who had not done more to solve the nation's problems during the Depression. There was support for calls for equality of sacrifice. There was some degree of goodwill toward the Soviet Union as a wartime ally. There was also, very importantly, the enhanced position of the Labour party. It had entered into Coalition in 1940 (its leader, Clement Attlee, became deputy prime minister to Churchill) and had demonstrated its claim to be a capable partner in government. As the 1940s progressed, there developed a notable movement, including within the Conservative party, for a greater degree of social and economic intervention by government. This was to find some authoritative expression during the war years themselves and more especially in the years after 1945, when a general election resulted in the return of the first Labour government with a clear working majority in the House of Commons. The period of the 1940s and the 1950s was to produce what Samuel Beer has referred to as the welfare state and the managed economy, or what some commentators have referred to as the period of the social democratic consensus. The welfare state and the managed economy did not suddenly emerge full-blown in this period. The preceding decades has not witnessed governments unresponsive to electoral expectations and the nation's problems. The Liberal government before the First World War had made the first tentative steps in the introduction of old-age pensions (1908) and national health and unemployment insurance (1911). The interwar years had seen the introduction of a number of significant measures of social reform, especially those associated with Neville Chamberlain as minister of health. He proposed to the cabinet 25 measures and secured the enactment of 21 of them. These included unemployment insurance, public health and housing, and the extension of old-age pensions. Much of this legislation, as one biographer noted, ""has an important place in the development of the Welfare State.""  The government also began to engage in certain measures of economic management. It embarked on a protectionist policy and in return for the grant of a tariff to an industry, demanded that its major producers should reorganize themselves. Such producers were encouraged to reduce capacity and maintain prices. The gold standard was abandoned, the pound was  devalued, and interest rates were lowered. The government even proved willing to take certain industries into public ownership: broadcasting, overseas airways, and the electricity-generating industry. By indulging in such policies, Professor Beer has contended, government was beginning to move in the direction of a managed economy. The movement, though, was modest. Government adhered to the prevailing orthodoxy that balanced budgets were necessary and desirable and that deficit financing was neither. Ministers showed little desire to emulate the innovative approach adopted in the United States by Franklin Roosevelt during the period of the first New Deal. (Indeed, Conservative leader Stanley Baldwin commented at one point that the United States Constitution had broken down and was giving way to dictatorship.) Britain and the United States were similar, though, in that both were to be brought out of the Depression of the 1930s not by government economic policies but by rearmament and the Second World War. Two major documents published in the war years provided the planks for the final emergence of the welfare state and managed economy. These were the Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services by Sir william Beveridge (the so-called Beveridge Report), published in November 1942, and the White Paper on Full Employment, published in 1944. The former proposed a comprehensive scheme of social security, one to provide ""social insurance against interruption and destruction of earning power and for special expenditure arising at birth, marriage or death.""  The latter was significant because of its opening pledge: ""The Government accepts as one of their primary aims and responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment after the war.""  There was also one particularly significant measure of social reform enacted during wartime: the 1944 Education Act, pioneered by R. A. Butler. The Act provided for the division among primary, secondary, and higher education — and, within secondary education, between secondary modern and grammar schools — that was to form the basis of the educational system for more than a generation. The welfare state was brought to fruition by the establishment of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, entailing the nationalization of hospitals and the provision of free medical treatment, and by the passage of the 1945 Family Allowance Act, the 1946 National Insurance Act, and the 1948 National Assistance Act. the principle enunciated by the Beveridge Report was largely put into practice. National insurance ensured a certain level of benefit in the event of unemployment or sickness. For those who required special help there was ""national assistance,"" the provision of noncontributory benefits dispensed on the basis of means-testing. There were family allowances for those with children. The state now provided something of a protective safety net from the cradle to the grave. It was still possible to pay for private treatment in the health service, but for most people it was a case of  having treatment ""on the national health.""  The NHS became a feature of some pride at home and of considerable interest abroad. Acceptance and usage of techniques pioneered by the economist J. M. Keynes ushered in the managed economy. Government accepted responsibility for keeping aggregate monetary demand at a level sufficient to ensure full employment or what was considered as far as possible to constitute full employment (an unemployment rate of 1% or 2% was considered acceptable), and the annual Budget was to be used as the main instrument of economic policy. The Labour government proved unwilling to pursue a more overtly socialist approach; physical controls acquired during wartime were eventually discarded and those industries that were nationalized, such as steel and the railways, were basically essential and loss-making concerns. Government was prepared to pursue a managed rather than a controlled economy. The Conservative party was returned to office in 1951 and was to remain there until 1964. It accepted, or appeared to accept, both the welfare state and Keynesian techniques of demand management. Indeed, it gave the impression of making a success of both. As heir to the Disraelian belief in elevating the condition of the people and as a party seeking to enhance its image among working class voters, the Conservative Party could claim both a principled as well as a practical motive for maintaining the innovations of its predecessor. At the same time, it was reluctant to pursue policies that would increase the tax burden or the public sector of the economy. Good fortune was with the government: world economic conditions improved and heralded a period of sustained growth in industrial output and trade. Government revenue was such that not only was it possible to sustain and indeed expand expenditure on the national health serve, it was possible to do so without substantial increases in taxation. Indeed, reductions rather than increases in tax rates were a feature of the period. There was an extensive and successful house-building program. Economic prosperity allowed government to maintain peace with the labor unions by allowing high wage settlements. It was also possible finally to abandon many of the controls maintained since wartime. Government was able to claim to have maintained full employment, an expanding economy, stable prices, and a strong pound. Despite the agonies of withdrawing from Empire and various undulations in economic performance, the decade of the 1950s was seen more than anything as ""an age of affluence.""  In July 1957, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was able to declare that, for most of the people, ""You've never had it so good.""  The 1960s witnessed a downturn in economic performance and a growing realization that, in comparative terms, Britain was faring less well than many of her continental neighbors. The Conservative government of Harold Macmillan responded with various novel proposals, including indicative  economic planning and an application to join the European Economic Community. The succeeding Labour government of Harold Wilson, returned to office in 1964, sought a more comprehensive method of national economic planning as part of its grand design of modernization. Inflation and unemployment became more visible problems. Despite the economic problems and some unrelated political problems of the 1960s, the country remained a relatively prosperous one. Living conditions continued to improve. The rise in wages exceeded the rise in inflation. Where economic conditions impinged on the ability to maintain the welfare state, it was essentially at the margin: government imposed nominal charges for medicines obtained on NHS prescriptions. Parties tended to argue more about means rather than ends. The consensus that developed in the 1950s remained intact. This brief survey not only provides some historical depth to an understanding of contemporary British government — its structure, responsibilities, and political dominance — it also serves to reinforce our grasp of the political culture and to provide in part an explanation for some of the problems now associated with government. POLITICAL CULTURE AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS From the foregoing sketch one can recognize not only the features of the political culture outlined in the preceding chapter but also the convergence of those features and their interplay with the experience of history. An empirical orientation to change and a conditional relationship between governors and governed are long-standing characteristics of political life. Clearly, government has been shaped by no grand design. Change has been piecemeal and largely incremental. Although the governed have been largely prepared to defer to those in power, their deference has been conditional. If presumed rights and privileges were ignored or dispensed with, the appropriate action was taken to restore them (e.g. the Magna Carta, the beheading of Charles I). The other orientations can be identified from the experience of reform in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. History and Political Culture The reforms of the nineteenth century were facilitated not only by an empirical orientation to change but also by the paternalism of political leaders. Noblesse oblige(privilege entails responsibility) is a foreign phase but it embodies a very British concept. Many of the country's aristocratic leaders believed that they had a duty to help improve the condition of the working man. The point should not be overemphasized, since on occasion this sense  of duty was not so much a cause of action but a post hoc justification of it. Nonetheless, it was important. It combined with need (to avoid social unrest) and political expediency (to steal the thunder of one's opponents) to produce franchise extension. Increasingly, change was more easily accommodated as political relationships changes. By the twentieth century, the hegemony of government in the political process ensured that measures could be carried through Parliament without too much difficulty. Equally important, once approved by Parliament, reforms were accepted by the populace and by those at whom they were directed. The widening of the franchise in the nineteenth century, House of Lords reform, and votes for women in the twentieth — these are issues that aroused great emotion and were fiercely opposed but on which reform was accepted once the government of the day had got the measure accepted by Parliament. This in part reflects the orientation toward cooperation. It also may be seen as the product of an allegiant orientation to the political system. The widening of the franchise extended the input of citizens into the political system. The passage of measures of social and economic reform appeared to be meeting their needs. Equally important, Britons have been taught that the political system works. Although the media of political socialization have changed over time, the content has not. There has been an emphasis on, and lauding of, the continuity and stability. Historically, as we have seen, the country has been rent by various upheavals, sometimes of a quite violent nature. The English Civil War was far from bloodless. The opinion of foreigners, wrote an English scholar in 1704, is ""that there have been more shakes and convulsions in the government of England than in that of any other nation.""  There have been various shakes since — social, economic, and political. In the popular mind, though, such convulsions have not figures largely.  ""What makes the history of England so eminently valuable,"" wrote T. H. Buckle, ""is that nowhere else has the national progress been so little interfered with, either for good or evil.""  British government has been accepted as the product of the collected wisdom of many generations, indeed of many centuries. It flatters the British mind, and certainly the English mind, to look upon it as the envy of the world. The Constitution has been lauded as ""a living organism in a condition of perpetual growth.""  George III described it as ""the most perfect of human formations.""  Only recently, in 1981, one member of Parliament declared that, distinguished from other constitutions, ""our constitution is the envy of the world.""  The virtues of the Westminster model of government have been widely extolled. They became embodied in what was taught in British schools. They became part of received wisdom, and to some extent, they remain so. The British have not been alone in such teaching. British parliamentary government has found its admirers abroad as well, and not least in the United States. Especially in the 1950s and 1960s, the capacity of the party  in government to enact a party program was compared with the brokered politics of the American system. It was a comparison that generated some calls for reform; most notable among these was James MacGregor Burns in The Deadlock of Democracy published in 1963, arguing the case essentially for the equivalent in the United States of a ""responsible party system.""  Such calls were to extend into the following decade. Charles Hardin cited British experience in contending that ""party government — if it can be attained — provides the best hope that our government will be able to meet its problems.""  Although not all observers wished to emulate British experience, their analyses appeared edged with a touch of envy. In more recent years, such perceptions have waned. In the 1970s, conditions in Britain began to change. Economic indicators worsened considerably, and unemployment rose dramatically (see Chapter 1). By 1973, Britain had the lowest growth rate of the major industrialized nations. Between 1974 and 1978 there was an annual rate of increase in retail prices in excess of 17%. Industrial disputes became more serious: there were more working days lost through such disputes in the period from 1970 to 1978 than there were in the whole of the period from 1946 to 1969. In less than 30 years, the British economy had declined from being one of the strongest to one of the weakest in Europe. Successive governments encountered problems in responding to the changed conditions and in raising resources to meet public expectations. Britain was overshadowed by a body of which, until 1973, it was not a member — the European Communities. Government was increasingly constrained by the activities of economically powerful groups, both at home and abroad (notably, in the latter case, the International Monetary Fund). Although parliamentary government did not cease to work, it no longer appeared to be working in the way that it had in the past. The positive picture of British government began to lose its gloss; academics who had previously written about the political system in positive terms now turned their attention to the problem inherent in that system. British parliamentary government began to assume the status of a rejected lover. Contemporary Ills and Analyses The diagnoses of Britain's problems have been as varied as the problems themselves. Some diagnoses are primarily economic. A number of economists have placed some of the blame for poor economic performance on a failure to modernize (there has been a tendency to retain old plants and to support traditional but declining industries, such as textiles); on the emphasis given to maintaining a balance of payments surplus in order to fund overseas military spending and foreign investments, pursued at the expense of economic growth, and on a failure of postwar economic management to  manipulate supply as well as demand. Others have stressed the legacies of former international glory, attitudes, and institutions derived from the days when Britain was at the center of the world economy, acting as a barrier to necessary change. Some diagnoses have been primarily sociological. As we have seen (Chapter 1), class did not displace status in British society. Preindustrial aristocratic attitudes were carried over into an industrial age. These attitudes included looking down on the pursuit of trade and commerce as somewhat inferior socially. Low priority was given to industry and science and, so the analysis goes, a tendency grew for those with wealth and some ability to avoid management in favor of professional pursuits such as the law. Some blame has also been imputed to the egalitarianism of the labor movement, harboring dislike of profits and risk-taking as well as the values of thrift and self-reliance that underpin the operation of the free market. In short, the attitudes of both the social elite and the labor movement have served to hinder economic growth. The other diagnoses are essentially political. They are important in the context of later chapters and hence deserve some attention. The historical background provided in this chapter helps us understand some of these diagnoses as well as some of the prescriptions. The three main diagnoses are those of government overload, adversary politics, and pluralist stagnation. Prescriptions have included decentralization, electoral reform and more radical economic policies. The thesis of government overload is that as the responsibilities of government have increased, its capacity to meet them has decreased: the combination of these two features has resulted in an overloading of government. A government White Paper in 1970 declared that government had been attempting to do too much. ""This has placed an excessive burden on industry, and on the people of the country as a whole, and has also over-loaded the government machine itself… The weakness has shown itself in the apparatus of policy formulation and in the quality of many government decisions over the past 25 years."" Some writers have argued that the problem of overload has been made worse by the centralization of government decision-making. Centralized government, so the argument goes, has proved too large and too far removed from the problems with which it seeks to cope. Distance from those affected by government decisions has had the effect of increasing their indifference and sense of alienation, especially in the economically disadvantaged regions furthest from London. Government, according to the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1973, was viewed as being too remote. A compatible but independent thesis is that of adversary politics. It contends that attempts to generate institutions capable of dealing with Britain's long-term economic problems are thwarted by a political system that encourages an adversary relationship between the two main political parties, one that enables them to alternate in office so that each undoes the work of the other. The consequence, it is argued, is policy discontinuity, making it difficult if not impossible for industrialists and investors to plan ahead. The adversary relationship also encourages a constant escalation of promises by the parties, each seeking to out-promise the other in order to win the all-or-nothing spoils of a general election victory. When, as happened in the 1970s, the resources are no longer available to meet the promises made, disenchantment with the political system begins to develop. Furthermore, the parties are unable to respond adequately to such developments because of an unwillingness to tamper with a system that works to their mutual advantage. In short, Britain has a political system that is malfunctional and not amenable to radical reform. Pluralist stagnation suggests that the problem lies with the growth of groups in British society, each group pursuing its own interest. Those groups have brought pressure to bear on government to provide resources or pursue policies to the benefit of their members. Such has been the economic leverage of some groups that the role of government has become increasingly one of arbiter between the demands of groups rather than one of policy leader. The tendency of government to wish to avoid conflict has resulted in political inertia, government being unwilling to pursue policies that would generate sustained opposition from well-entrenched groups. The problem has been made worse, according to Samuel Beer, by the numerical growth of such groups. Because there are so many, self-restraint in making demands of government would bring no discernible benefit to any one group. As a result, even though recognizing the need for restraint, a group is tempted to raise its own claims. Other groups then compete to raise theirs.  ""The source of the problem,"" argues Beer,""is not a lack of knowledge, but the structure of the situation, which continues to have compelling force even when participants recognise its tendencies. Their numerical pluralism makes it difficult, if not impossible, to make and enforce a bargain, tacit or explicit, that would achieve moderation. If there were only a few, each could know what the others were doing and all would be aware of being watched. But pluralism destroys the basis for such a self-enforcing social contract."" For government the problem is thus an acute one. It has fewer benefits to dispense than previously, yet is faced with a plethora of interests, each of which is unwilling to moderate its demands in the interests of all. These constitute the main political analyses that see the problem as a structural one. There are others that do not see it as structural. The two largest parties in Britain, the Conservative and Labour parties, view Britain's problems as stemming from the pursuit in the past of inadequate policies (Chapter 6). There are other analyses that go beyond the structural or policy analyses, providing somewhat more complex explanations. The most important of these is that provided by Professor Beer in his recent work Britain Against Itself. He argues that there is no single causal explanation for  Britain's decline; rather, it has to be seen as resulting from a convergence of pluralist stagnation, a decline of class, and a revolt against authority. The result has been fragmentation in political life. ""The outcome has been incoherence and immobilism; drift, not mastery. It is not hyperbole to call it a paralysis of public choice."" I shall return to these analyses in appropriate chapters, responding in particular to Beer's sophisticated analysis in the conclusion. For the moment, two concluding points need to be made. The first, rather obviously, is that no one approach is without its detractors. Each approach has its limitations and these I shall seek to draw out at appropriate points in the text. The second equally obvious point is that, given the disparate analyses, a variety of prescriptions have been offered for dealing with the presumed causes of the nation's ills. Exponents of the government overload thesis tend to favor reform of central government machinery and decentralization of government. Those who adhere to the adversary politics thesis support, for reasons that will be explained later, a reform of the electoral system. Pluralist stagnation, according to Beer's analysis, can be overcome only by mobilizing popular consent through restoring trust in government. For the Conservative and Labour parties the answer lies in (different) radical economic policies. So wide are the analyses and the prescriptions that one is tempted to wonder whether the concept of pluralist stagnation might itself be applied to the political analysis of Britain's ills. My own argument I will draw together in the conclusion. For the moment, suffice it to say that I take a skeptical view of the structural analyses offered. They are unproven and overexaggerated and they miss the essential point. The problem is not primarily a structural one — structures are dependent variables. The independent variable on which one has to focus is the political culture. The political culture may have helped generate problems of political structure, but Britain's problems, I will argue, are not essentially political: they are economic and social. And the political culture is one that provides government with the breathing space necessary to address itself to those problems. Government may not succeed, but the opportunity is there and in order to understand that one has to understand the political culture and the extent to which it endures. The decline in the culture detected by Beer is relative. The orientations of the political culture identified in the preceding chapter remain. I concluded that chapter by suggesting that the important question was not ""why had there been a decline in the civic culture,"" but rather ""why had that decline not been greater?""  The answer to that question, and the implications of it for the British polity of the 1980s, will form the basis of the final chapter. My conclusion will not necessarily be an optimistic one — it will emphasize potential rather than expectation — but it will lack the negative connotations attached to the foregoing analyses. It will also forgo structural change as the primary prescriptions. What is important is attitudes, not structures."

A so, but you can also go Yeah. Yeah add three. Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one. Do it that way on. Do you follow  Yeah. me? Yes I do. Right. Two multiplication Yeah. and two addition. Two addition. Right. So you, like, you . Yes, that's right. Then, it's like erm  One. seven times three, and three times seven. And three times seven. That's right. And you do the same there. Same on the adds. And then, this  we do  like Right, she wants currency in two divisions  in each, right? So it's  one, two, three, four,fi  That multiplication is a  yeah well divisions, okay, so it's twenty one shared by  say, if that's one, two, three, four, five, six int it? Oh I know what I've got! Six times three is eighteen  or three times six is eighteen. I know what I've done. I've put the, I thought it was  er  okay. Six. And division is shared by. So you got to do eighteen shared by  six is three  and eighteen Have you got shared by three is six. So like, you go one, two, three, four, five, six  six times  you swap  Three. six times three  times three is eighteen  is three times six. Six. Yeah, and and you got  Six times three and three times six. A and division is  eighteen shared by  three  is six, and eighteen shared by six is three! Yeah? Got it? I cannot read  . Three sixes are eighteen! You got it? And you do the same there? Hang on! I haven't finished  thirty three  one yet. That's what I don't get. Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't a get how you do that? Is it, would you like us to put It's fours int it? It's fours  No two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve Yeah. It  That's twos. No, but it's going to fours look. It's going to  fours. Alright. Going into fours. What would I put? Er  one four is four, two fours are eight, and thre three fours is twelve. As  this is been shared by  lines int it? Yeah and it's on that one. You do it like that do you? Yeah, cos it's being shared by Oh! So it's, I would say that is  er  nine times four equals thirty six. And on that one is  er, sixty three shared by nine  six time  sixty three divided by nine four. No! Sixty three divided by  nine is six! Write six through it. Ten six  innit? No, it's ten sixes. No, no wait a minute. Nines. What should nine times ten Emma? One nine is nine, two nines are eighteen, three nines  are Twenty seven. Four nines are thirty six, five nines are forty five, six nines fifty four, seven nine are sixty three. Oh thank you. Right. Yeah, seven nines are sixty three. Hang on a minute! Six nines are seven nines are sixty three. Hang on a minute! Seven Seven nines are sixty three! Sixty three. Yeah. You work them out like that look. Yeah. Well seven nines, well ee er, it takes you so long  Look one , one nine is nine Yeah. Two nines are  eighteen. So that one there is  sixes into si thirty six. I know! But I still don't get what you have to write! Well multiplication equation for this number line  I would say is  er  I've already told you that. No, but I don't know what I have to, I have to write! Eight times four equals thirty six. Don't get it. Because it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven  eight, no sorry, nine times four is thirty six. Nine times four equals thirty six. Like this look! Write it out on a piece of paper and you'll  and I'll write them down. No! You do it yourself! I've told you what to do. You do it like that. I don't get it though! I'll tell you if it's right. I'm just writing the answers out for you! I told you what to do. That's lazy! Int it? You crafty cow!

It went just straight in The Tottenham game was really good wasn't it? You let them down  Yeah you, you were meant to come on and score two goals and Yeah You got the score they had the chances they tried oh he did he did, he put one two chances in the first twenty minutes Had er, I was gonna say  wasn't in the game, I just thought he was kind of harden No, every time he got the ball he'd kick it away Let's face it, let's face it Liverpool are not an international class team, if they can't if they cannot they are not an international playing team Hey, switch that bloody thing off  Go on have your say Rob I hope you're not selling this the I think you have, I think you have to bear in mind the er circumstances  What's your address  they, they were going up to score Of course they were and they failed, and they failed to penetrate the defence Yeah until the second half, in the second half they got they got a bit closer than Dewsbury though I've got to, I've got to admit the second half they were lucky our goalie produced four brilliant saves in about three minutes He was very lucky, as well, it just happened so many times he but the point is the point is Liverpool spent er ninety minutes over in Italy and forty five minutes in Anfield to penetrate their defence, it wasn't until the second half last night that they got anywhere near through, through, through the solid block of the defence  No, no I don't agree with that  Yeah, but if there hadn't, there hadn't of given that goal away and they were pushing forward That's right and they hadn't given that goal away, they'd of scored another in that half Liverpool mm Yeah, but on a different day four of those could of gone in. they, they should of done, but they didn't, the point is they shouldn't of left it the last minute, they should of done it in the first place I tell you what they're under pressure from a hard manager I, I, I don't and I, I I've never liked I think I think there's a lot of hope and promise Well I've still got two accounts in er June They had more shots at the target last night than anybody  the second and the fourth  He, he had about half a dozen shots and there wasn't one of them that could of put by  You got, oh you've got a couple of days  Yeah Aye, but there wasn't one of them that went in by either Aye he shouldn't, he shouldn't of been shooting, I thought I think there were cases when he should of put it forward to Saunders, even though Saunders was playing poorly Every time, er every time the broke down, the er It's academic now because they've lost and they're out of Europe  and I'm not convinced, I am not convinced that they, that they are anywhere near the standard they used to be when they were last in Europe a few seasons ago Yeah, well Mike it comes down to experience if they had five years of European experience Yeah, yeah Not quite as long as  Jan shall we get that I thought we'd finished them No, not quite Like one of those er dead squirrels on the end of the Yeah really bushy Have you played?

To be honest I can't remember, I know my lot on the last thing Wigan was doing two hundred and thirty an hour, so twelve times twenty, two hundred and thirty If we allow two hundred Well thanks a lot Bill, bye interviews Mm, two and a half thousand then an hour that's a box that's only a hundred interview forms an hour isn't it? Of course, yeah, because there's two on a sheet And that's allowing for spares as well, cos my sites aren't gonna be busy enough to do that, that many anyway I wouldn't of thought, so what you doing twelve hundred  a day? Mhm, it's, isn't there two and a half in a box? Is it? I don't know Have we got one over there? So that's three thousand six hundred  so if I add four thousand, three and a half to four thousand Mm, mm I'd be well in the clear then  two, there's two and a half nine and a half boxes over here  And how many's in a box? There's no lid on it so I can't tell Oh erm  Is there no lids on them at all? No  so there's two and a half thousand so there's five thousand interviews  we could do five thousand interviews with that? Hang on there's gotta be something wrong there, that means I'm only gonna need a box at the most, doesn't it, hang on, let's write it out  Start at the very beginning, there's two and a half thousand  That's allowed , the maximum  that we could do is two hundred interviews an hour Yeah okay would you agree with that? which is a hundred forms Would you agree? Mm, mm Two hundred interviews per hour, equals one hundred interview sheets  there's been some very good cases of sexual harassment lately and  Mm  they're getting millions in compensation Check the information with you erm, so I don't even know what they are er I'm not sure if I didn't  You know when people talk about you and they don't actually ask you they just mention things and hated  Is anybody talking about me? so that's Sorry, right two thousand for Excuse me Yes mate did I ask you to bring no only the red boxes, I thought they were already done Only the red boxes, what, what were the red boxes? Well, erm which I've sorted this morning  right have you sorted them, right, so you've done, what are these things? Don't know with them  Don't know what Scott's already archived but why they weren't put in boxes away somewhere I've no idea These meant to be archived are they? Well or at least sorted, maybe they're the ones that was supposed to be left out for future reference. I thought they'd already been done  I, produced a list of what's already inside here, er, these calculate are the files registered, they're not numbered so they wouldn't be registered, but they would surely So Rob's instruction was that he put them in those files and I didn't think it was a particularly good idea because everything's easier to find if it's in the envelopes that we've put them in. Now here, he's put down the interview date that was here, yeah he was starting to transfer the interview days across and I This is er I stopped him, I said don't do that leave them in the envelopes and mark them as they are, so what  We, actually I think we stopped him doing that because we put information on the envelopes as well which he didn't see  Yeah we divided them all up, but if me or Jan needed to refer to anything we'd recognize the information that we've put on the envelopes quicker than we'll recognize the stuff that he's put in there  We realized too late anyway before we Is he, did, he's labelled this wrong anyway, he's called this interviewed date for data fifty three, but it isn't interview data, it's count data  oh  Wigan do you  If you put it with that pile of envelopes Mike can you sort that out cos that is Wigan and if you leave them in the pile fair enough and I think they can go to archive, but please can you re-title the contents page and the pages cos they're not interview data it's count data, er I would of thought by now Scott knew the difference between interview and account Why he's never done an interview Well to be fair you're right, but I would of thought someone Well he told me he'd gone for a count  sorry He said he'd gone for a count for a job Oh it's a good job we've got one wit in the team, I wonder where he is? Posy, er right where are we? Two hundred interview per hour equals four hundred and three sheets  three thousand Sixty three, seventy nine That's it no See again, he could of put some dates in so, I, this needs proper registering Yeah been on file well I've got another file that needs proper registering yeah, but again I should just get some of these checked, every content, you know that the heading Mm it, they look it hasn't done interviews unfortunately Right okay No, no, no, we only need a hundred sheets an hour  Hello mm, mm and there's twelve hours so we'll only need  a thousand and two hundred Mm, mm Which one is it? so call it half a box Mm, mm Wilf  telephone call, Wilf  telephone So I need one and a half boxes Mm, mm for, I'm gonna have them all in the boot of the car, at all times, so I'm gonna have two boxes please Mm, mm two boxes, er that's er ten whole boxes six thousand  so  right now you'll have so what did we just say for you? You need six thousands do you? Yeah divided by I'm not even sure, we don't even know his name so let's give you three Well my understand of control is is one at control that you can call back in or destroyed and be replaced by so the control copy should always be and I want two boxes we've already got four and a half boxes It's a very loose definition and one which so let's order two for us and that'll give us five and a half, six and a half boxes another half box spare but I mean there's spares in them anyway yeah but we never actually said anything to control, we only say what's wrong with the job and why, why people suddenly started saying we've got to go around marking what we should be doing is marking control, control Or doing nothing or doing nothing and say nothing to control Yeah we could possibly there's no guarantee which there can't be can there, and say it gets lost in the post then you're not gonna have it updated No no and automatically assumed that, if it's important even, even within our own little team No I'm sure your mum and dad will not find that  and we should have systems whereby if you were what's more I'm convinced it  and you can guarantee that you still a human error even though you know how to do it, and we cannot guarantee that you'll do it so it, so it is, the, it is very important that nobody takes anything off the shelf automatically assume Mind you no point in It does matter we really need to know whether to make necessary phone calls Right I'll make a note of yours I've put yours on separate sheet, have you seen it? The return return actually interview if I do effect all the Well you're all gonna have some with your timesheets  You go and see Will then before we think about ordering it then No, I said we'll go round and tell, tell him what we've just worked out there, get him to say yes Yes and then you can give okay yes How many? Ask Tracey how, whether they order them by the box or whatever Where, does Tracey yeah Oh I thought if Tracey can get them it might be more reliable to get them from Tracey. Could you do me a favour? About the interview forms, what you want yeah No Could you down there? Which one? No do a couple please if you don't mind, because you might need a couple spare  Hello can I speak to Bob  please  Have you used these things now Richard? Yes thank you no, why you volunteering? yeah You, you tell Bill what Well I don't, I don't really understand myself what it wants, so I'm not in a position to Erm, is that three eight one five oh no, no sorry that's the wrong extension, er have you any idea if anyone can get to alright, thank you  er, no I'll come back shortly, what extension should I ask for first of all? Three eight double one, okay thank you very much, bye  goes away, everything according to plan Why where is he? He's at Halford today and then he goes on his holidays for a bit Oh great  Well he's off tomorrow anyway Don't we get a stand in? and now we're short of paper No, what the green stuff? No, there's nothing downstairs, well Steve said he had the lot, the last box Oh good god, it's about time they got their arses in gear and started doing something properly Yeah Yeah, there really is no excuse is there? I get I ge to be honest though erm half the problem's been I think that it's been spoiling off so much crap, you know when I was doing those little things no wonder we're going through such a lot of paper Yeah if it's doing that for everyone and there's a mountain of scrap paper in there It's the way you speak to pardon? It's the way you speak to it what the printer, oh don't you make me feel guilty, no I it's just stupid isn't it? It is how many pages you getting? I was having about four pages, three pages before, four pages in between each one, and another at the end as well  At least I've cracked it I think I can get it to actually page properly until Vicky comes on Mm  Remember that report the Oh you are kidding"
FIC FIC-AC2-002 0.82 "While Mark was in Dublin the head of the French Development Authority DATAR paid a courtesy visit to Detroit to make the point to Nate Cocello, and Chairman, Tom O'Reilly that France was keen to attract very much more United Motors investment. The fact that France had already received the lion's share of new European component investment over the previous five years was beside the point. That was past. France wanted the lion's share of all future European investment too, and was most concerned to hear that the Corporation was also considering investment in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Ireland and the UK. It was put to the two top men and to the Vice President in charge of Overseas' Operations that the interests of France could only be adequately served by Frenchmen, and not by Americans or Englishmen. The fact that Sanders, an Englishman, had produced the plan which had changed French plants from ailing and unprofitable operations in the sixties, into expanding and profitable divisions in the seventies was discreetly overlooked. Mark had actually transferred certain expanding and profitable product lines and manufacturing facilities from the UK to France to consolidate a new range of components at French locations. All hell would have been let loose by the French plants and the French Government if the boot had been on the other foot and anyone had attempted to transfer products and facilities from France to the UK. The top men had listened courteously to their visitor's observations and requests without reaction. Under his breath, the Vice President was telling him to get stuffed. The French Government would object to Jesus Christ being head of European Operations, on the grounds that He wasn't a Frenchman. In his capacity as world-wide planning coordinator, Mueller had been invited by Nate Cocello to attend the meeting as an observer. He had listened to DATAR ‘s views with great interest, and from a totally different viewpoint to that of the Vice President. Mueller wanted to bring world planning under his personal direction and control from Detroit. He could understand — so he said to the top brass after the Frenchman had departed — why the French took exception to an Englishman holding such a key position in Europe. He could also understand why they objected to London being the European headquarters of United Motors. Chairman Tom O'Reilly took a similar view but for different reasons. He had been against the choice of London as the location for European Headquarters when he had been Treasurer. As an active supporter of the ‘Irish cause’ he hated Britain and the British. ‘I guess those European Government bastards would object wherever we located European headquarters,’ said Cocello. ‘The French hate London, but they would also object to Bonn, Rome, Brussels…you name it. It would still be wrong until you mentioned Paris. Then it would be right.’ ‘The same goes, I guess, for other Governments,, said the Chairman. ‘There is no single acceptable location, as they see it, unless it is in their own country. The French hate London and the British, but then, who doesn't?’ he added maliciously. ‘Waal,, rejoined Cocello. ‘If the Europeans fight like hell over new investment and where European headquarters should be, maybe we should consider running everything from here in Detroit, the way it used to be. We could do it, of course.’ ‘Sure could,’ added Mueller eagerly, and received a look of cold disapproval from the Vice President in charge of Overseas' Operations for his unwarranted opinion. ‘Well, why don't we chew on it a bit?’ asked the ageing Chairman. ‘Maybe we should,’ replied the President and Chief Executive Officer. ‘Randy, would you put down something for discussion by the Executive Committee?’ ‘Yes sir, Will do.’ Mark Sanders spent the next few days in his office, working late into the night to finalise the ten year European Business Plan and to summarise the massive document into a sixty minute presentation illustrated by thirty slides. Fred Klepner had been in and out of both Mark's and Pat Muldoon's offices, which were only a few yards apart, like an eager beaver. He would grab a completed section of the overall plan from Mark's private secretary just as soon as she had typed it, and dash off to his own office down the corridor to study it carefully many times over, before taking it along to Muldoon to keep him in the picture. Klepner played the usual corporate cat and mouse game of making at least one or two word changes on each and every page so that his own secretary could re-type each page under her initials and the initials ‘FK’. This practice achieved twin objectives. It gave the European plan anonymity by not identifying the author of the plan, while his own copy under his own initials and those of his secretary would tell Mueller and his Detroit colleagues that he had a hand in its formulation, which is what Mueller and Muldoon wanted people to think. As presentation day grew closer with Mark racing against time to complete the plan and finalise the slide illustrations, so Klepner read and re-read it until he had almost learnt it off by heart. So complete was his total immersion in the subject that he actually began to believe that he had assisted Sanders in the plan's preparation. His delusions were those of a messenger boy who assumes that because he takes the Chief Architect's drawings to the print room, he has played a leading role in the design of the building. A few days before the European Planning Committee was due to meet, Mueller decided to go for the jugular. His suggestion that United Motors should progressively wind up its European, South American and Asian regional headquarters and plan, direct and control world operations from its home base in Detroit, had been well-received by most of the top brass who liked the big bold approach of running  the world the way it used to be…from Detroit. They were under no illusions that they could do a better job from Detroit, but they had become increasingly concerned that they were getting out of touch with what was happening around the world, and that the tail was beginning to wag the dog. The European zone, for example, was growing twice as fast as the United States' zone, and now employed a quarter of a million people. This situation went against the grain, as the top brass always needed to be on top of every situation and on top of every executive if they were to do their jobs to their own satisfaction; not necessarily in the best interests of the Corporation, that is to say, but in their own best interests. Mueller's proposals appeared to be more in tune with their own thoughts at that particular time. For this reason he was given the green light to prepare more detailed proposals for further consideration. Confident in the knowledge that he now had the general support of most of the top brass to his world control plan, Mueller considered that he was now in a much stronger position to start pulling the rug out from under the Regional Area Managers. And, as the biggest zone by far was Europe, he would begin there. His plan to appoint Klepner to succeed Sanders as European Planning Manager, based on Detroit rather than London, was working out to perfection. Klepner had been doing everything that was expected of him acting as Mueller's eyes and ears in Europe. It was now necessary to give Klepner visibility in front of Cocello and the top brass. Muldoon was no problem. He wouldn't mind taking early retirement. He was over sixty and a relatively wealthy man, with a wife who was financially independent. He would welcome the chance of retiring to his yachts. McGillicuddy wouldn't relish the idea of giving up the General Director's job as European overlord, but he was also sixty and could be kicked upstairs for a year or so before taking early retirement. H e certainly wouldn't be short of a dollar or two. Sanders was a bit of a problem. He was in his early fifties  and couldn't be retired early, except on a very much reduced company pension. But…so what? He could count himself lucky to have got where he had got in an all-American company. He could be offered an MD job in one of the UK divisions which he would obviously turn down; but so what! From now on the locals would do what they were told to do by Detroit, and if they didn't like it they could take the option of either getting out of their own free will, or being booted out. He'd had enough of all that European political crap about overseas subsidiaries also having to represent the interests of the local host country where United Motors had a manufacturing presence. Bullshit. Their one and only interest was to serve the interest of the Corporation in the US of A and anyone in a top position overseas who didn't understand that number one lesson would soon have his nose put out of joint. From here on in, Randy Mueller was going to start calling the shots. He reckoned that his chances of making the Presidency before he was sixty were now better than ever. He should make a Vice Presidency within five, the Presidency within ten. President Randy Mueller, the all-American boy who had made it from right here in his little ole home town of Detroit. He rose from his enormous desk and lit a big cigar — it couldn't have been a Havana — and strutted around his vast office like a peacock, admiring his reflection in the long mirror. Randy loved himself and everything he stood for. It was surely great to be an American going up in the greatest company in the world and in the greatest country in the world. God bless America, and piss on the rest. He walked to the phone, pausing on the way to take another admiring look at himself in the mirror. ‘Miss Kopensky,’ he barked. ‘Yes, Mr Mueller, sir.’ ‘Get me Muldoon.’ ‘Yes sir, right away, sir.’ ‘And Miss Kopensky.’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘Have a nice day, Miss Kopensky.’ ‘Thank you, sir; have a nice day yourself, sir.’ ‘I will, Miss Kopensky, I will.’ ‘Mr Muldoon on the line, sir. ‘Hi ya Pat buddy boy. Happy Thanksgiving.’ ‘You're a bit earl Randy You puttin' the clock forward?, ‘You could put it that way. A long way forward.’ ‘I don't get it.’ ‘No buster, but you will, you will.’ ‘Quit stallin around Randy, will ya. What is it?’ ‘We got ourselves a new ball park,’ said the man from Detroit. ‘Nate and the Executive Committee have agreed in principle to phase-out all regional activities and bring the whole god-damned shootin' match right back here to Detroit, where I always said it should be.’ ‘You gotta be kiddin'.’ ‘Nope. I'm deadly serious. I produced some option plans and they took to it like a duck takes to water.’ ‘What, Nate and the Executive Committee?’ ‘Yep. Well…with a few exceptions.’ ‘You serious?’ ‘Course I'm serious.’ ‘You amaze me. That's a major organisational change. Fundamental policies.’ ‘Too damned right it is. And yours truly is in the drivin' seat. So hang on for the ride, Pat. It's all systems go.’ ‘And where do I fit in under the new organisation?’ Muldoon asked. ‘Do I get early retirement on full pension?, ‘Sure do. Yes, siree. Just what you wanted. Now you can quit the heat of the kitchen and swan around on those yachts of yours you got stashed around the world.’ ‘Yeah, guess you're right. It's gotta be better than work.’ ‘At your age. You better believe it.’ ‘What about McGillicuddy?’ ‘He'll be all right. He'll be kicked upstairs for a year or so before taking early retirement.’ ‘And Sanders? What about him? He's only in his early fifties.’ ‘Yeah, well. We ain't gonna have no limey runnin' Europe from Detroit, that's for sure. It's got to be an American. You  and I are gonna recommend Klepner. He's been doin' what he's been told to do, and feedin' me back all the inside information I need. I can trust him. He's the kind of guy I'm lookin' for to head up regional planning. Someone who will carry out Detroit instructions. I don't want Mister smart arse Sanders on my Detroit team.’ ‘Well, what's gonna happen to him?’ ‘Don't know for sure yet, but there won't be any European corporate jobs left after we centralise everything in Detroit. He can be offered a divisional job in one of the UK divisions I suppose.’ ‘Come off it, Randy. He won't go back to divisional work after ten years at corporate level. He couldn't possibly accept such a demotion.’ ‘Well, he ain't comin' here to Detroit, that's for sure. And I can tell you, buddy boy, that he's Persona non grata with the US vehicle divisions after his comments about the future European trend toward smaller fuel economy vehicles at the EPC meeting.’ ‘Well that's the way things are goin' over here, and that's the way he sees it goin' in the future, under the Government constraints he outlined at that meetin'.’ ‘Well all I'm tellin' you, Pat, is that he's made a lot of enemies. Those guys don't like being questioned by Europeans. We run this business…not Europeans.’ Muldoon stared into space, his face expressionless. ‘Hey Patrick. You still there?’ ‘Yeah, Randy,’ Muldoon sighed forlornly. ‘I'm here.’ ‘I want you to get Sanders out of the country just before next week's EPC meeting and keep him out until after the meetin's over. I want you to give the European components presentation to Klepner.’ ‘What's that?’ ‘No, correction. I want you to introduce the plan and then hand over the presentation to Klepner. You can introduce him as the guy you and I appointed some months back to work with Sanders on the preparation of the Business Plan. That way we can see that he gets the credit. It will also make it easier  when you and I recommend him to take over from Sanders when we pull it back to Detroit. If Klepner's gonna get his job he may as well do the spiel. We can go easy on him with the questions, but I want Nate to be impressed. Get it?’ ‘Yeah… I guess so, Randy…if you say so. But I gotta tell you that I don't like it. It stinks.’ ‘Yeah, yeah. But before you can make an omelette you gotta break a few eggs, ain't that so?’ ‘But the Business Plan is his baby, Randy. He's put that whole damn thing together, almost single-handed. And it's not gonna be easy to get him outta the country…. He'll fight like hell to present it. I just don't like it.’ ‘Aw come on, Pat. You're making me cry. OK, so you lose some and you win some. Sanders loses. We can't all be winners. Anyway, don't you worry none. You'll be all right. Just do what I say, will ya? There s no point in you tryin to swim against the tide now, is there? At your age, you'd drown!’ Muldoon winced visibly at the younger man's cruel analogy. But he was right. There was no point in swimming against the tide. At his age he really would drown and nobody in the Corporation would give a damn. ‘Are you sure, Randy, that Nate and the executive committee agree with your proposals?’ ‘Of course I'm sure. What the hell do you think I've been talkin' about the last few minutes? Hey and listen, Pat, I don't want to see or hear any reference to that part of the plan which shows that we can save up to a billion dollars a year by supplying components from the European plants to fit US manufactured vehicles. That's not on. The US components divisions would hit the goddamned roof if that proposal was ever given the light of day. Is that understood?’ ‘Well, I hear what you're sayin' Randy, but I don't necessarily agree with ya. Mark was asked by McGillicuddy for some ideas by which European plants could reduce corporate operating costs on a world wide basis. Mark's right. European component manufacturing costs are lower than in the States, and we could save the Corporation around a billion dollars a year by purchasin' components from our European plants. So what's wrong with puttin' it up for discussion?’ ‘Because the US components divisions ain't gonna like it, that's why! We'd have a full scale fight on our hands with those  guys if we went ahead with that proposal!’ ‘Yeah, but hang on a minute, Randy. Isn't that exactly what you are proposing to do in reverse? You and the Corporation have been telling us to purchase from our new subsidiaries in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore and even from Japan, for God's sake. Mark has told you guys many times that European Governments and European plant people ain't gonna like that one little bit, particularly when their own Far East markets are heavily protected. So what's different about Mark's plan to sell components from our European plants into the United States, if we can save the Corporation a billion dollars a year by doin' so?, ‘Whose side are you on, Pat?’ ‘The Corporation's, Randy. Whose side are you on?’ ‘The Corporation's and Uncle Sam's. Aren't you?’ ‘My responsibilities are European, so are Mark's. If the Corporation wants to turn our suggestions down, so be it. But we represent the interests of our European plants, as well as the overall interests of the Corporation. How else do we explain to Plant Managers and to Governments that it's right for the Corporation to purchase products from non-European sources, but it's wrong to supply European components to the United States because the US divisions wouldn't like it?’ ‘Since when has the interest of the United States come second, Pat?’ ‘Since when have we had a Corporation plan which is not truly multi-national, Randy?’ ‘Since the year dot,’ said the younger American with finality. Muldoon was beginning to get an uncomfortable feeling that he was pushing his opinions too far, something he had never done in his life. He sensed the danger and eased back. ‘Guess you're right, Randy,’ he said submissively. ‘Sure I'm right, Pat. You know that. Look, I'm simply tellin' ya to drop it out of the presentation, that's all. The executive committee won't go along with something which doesn't have the support of the US divisions. You know that. So why don't you do as I say and drop it? We will amend the plan from this end when we pull it all together. Just don't include it in the  presentation, that's all. Sanders has already got the US vehicle divisions lined up against him. No point you adding the component divisions as well. Be smart. Do as I say.’ ‘Yeah. I suppose you are right, Randy. It's a no-win situation. ‘Attaboy. Now you're talkin'.’ ‘But I don't like it, Randy. It's dirty.’ ‘Yeah sure. But you'll do it?’ ‘What choice is there?’ ‘None, I guess, if you're still interested in your own future.’ ‘How do I get him out of the country? As I say, he'll fight like hell to give the presentation.’ Don't worry. We'll cook somethin' up from this end. We got Government bastards crawlin' all over us out here with their beggin' bowls at the ready. How does he fancy Iran or Turkey? They are the two latest to join the beggin' bowl line. They'd love to see him down there. Lambs' eyes and bulls' bollocks for dinner. He'd just love that. I'll be in touch shortly to tell you what we've cooked up. Must go Pat. Nice talkin' to ya. Have a nice day.’ Muldoon lowered the phone slowly, shaking his head sadly. My God, what was the Corporation coming to when unscrupulous people like Mueller were influencing its future and the destinies of countless loyal, hardworking and respected executives on overseas operations? What in the world would the company be like in a few years' time if such people were in the driving seat? Well the answer to that question, he supposed, was that there wouldn't be an overseas Corporation to worry about. What would be the world reaction when the full implications of the new World Car Plan under the new centralised organisation became more obvious? What would be the reaction of local managers, of Governments, of the employees and the unions? He shuddered at the thought of all the potential conflict situations ahead. He was glad he was getting out."
FIC FIC-FAJ-001 -0.69 "TWELVE It's no news that memory is deceitful. I have tried to explain that in Claudia's case memory is particularly treacherous, but Letterman likes the idea of ambiguity. He sees it as European, a kind of intellectual chic, useful to our story. He has come a long way since he worked as a production runner with James Wong Howe and Martin Ritt in a coal-mining village in Pennsylvania. I suspect his own memory is a little unreliable; in his telling he was Martin Ritt's right-hand man and Sean Connery's golfing partner after just one week. He is self-deprecating but ail his anecdotes feature his achievements. Whatever the ostensible subject matter, Letterman — as clapper loader, assistant director, co-author, executive producer — emerges from the narrative undergrowth muddled, festooned in foliage, sometimes even bloodied, but always victorious. Muthaiga Club, where I am staying, releases forgotten gusts of memory, like those lilies which only exhale their sweet perfume at night. My father was happiest in places like this. He loved clubs and wardrooms with the pre-dinner drinks, the discreet signing of chitties, the smiling elderly waiters (from a class almost extinct now, men who lived to serve other men). I remember arriving in my father's Pontiac at clubs just like this, sweeping (not always silently; the car was old) down to the front door to be deposited and greeted, to be called ‘sir’ by elderly black men. I remember running on the rolling lawns of Kikuyu grass before dinner, the night noises of the exceptionally vocal African insect life striking up as it quickly grew dark, night unrolling from the ground upwards; bullfrogs — in fact all manner of rana and bufo-frogs the size of a pair of roiled-up rugby socks, toads with  great horned eyebrows, and tiny, reddish, darting amphibians, starting to howl, shriek, growl, and purr, a backdrop to our dinner on the terrace to which we have been summoned by the stirring, thrilling, beating of a gong hung from a pair of tusks. We sit straight, elbows tucked in, endless soup spoons, fish knives and butter knives to deal with. ‘A gentleman is a man who uses the butter knife even when his wife is not at home,’ said my father, only two-thirds joking. The dinner itself, a ritual of many courses, begins to emerge in relays from the swing doors of the kitchen, the food bland and unexceptionable, but plentiful and somehow sanctified by being served by the immaculate waiters in sashes and gloves. So Muthaiga Club is instantly familiar. My room looks out over a croquet lawn, at the end of which is a pond thickly planted with papyrus — the eponymous plant always mentioned by school teachers in any history of written language — in which, I know with certainty, all hell will break loose as dusk falls. High on the wall of my room, near the open window, waiting for the lights to come on, a gecko is clinging on hopefully to the knobbly plaster. Unlike other members of the reptile family, the gecko is a benign creature, cheery, opportunistic and patently useful. I am troubled by the thought that this familiar world into which I am able to slip without a moment's readjustment, is a vanishing world. The club is now written up in style magazines; models are photographed with the head waiter. (Models are often photographed surrounded by nearly naked Masai warriors.) The world of fashion and advertising (from which Victoria has not quite made her escape — she is like someone with one boot stuck deep in the mud, unable to move either way) now uses places like that as themes for new looks or as inspiration for ‘lifestyles’. S. O. Letterman has something similar in mind, a re-creation of colonial Africa, as seen from Santa Monica Boulevard. Right here, in Muthaiga, colonial Africa lives on. But does it live self-consciously, or blithely as it did when I was a child? I am as aware as anyone of the changes going on in the world. I earn my living by observing them and commenting on them. But coming here has made me realize how much time has passed since, as a small boy, we used to set off for dinners and functions. I have probably not heard or read the phrase ‘beetle drive’ in my adult life, yet on the noticeboard of the club, just under the list of aspirant members duly proposed and seconded and posted, is the announcement of a beetle drive in aid of the library fund. The notice is signed by Sir Thomas Fairfax, Hon. Secretary, Library Committee. I remember the frenzy of a beetle drive, the wings, the little legs, the stubby pencils, the cries of ‘beetle’, the powdering of the noses, the soda siphons fizzing. Proust (who was a near neighbour and acquaintance of Léon Cohn-Casson) thought that memory could unlock the imagination. He was always searching, rummaging:Les vrais paradis sont les paradis qu'on a perdus . I fear it can throttle imagination. These memories which are summoned here in Africa seem to me like tendrils of vines attaching themselves to me. They have in them presages of mortality; I have a feeling that there is now more of my past life than my future. And I am aware of my past life; I feel it looming up behind me, breathing lightly on the nape of my neck. Nineteen fifty-eight, small boy arrives in pontiac at club. Servants bow and scrape. Khaki shorts replaced by abrasive long trousers for the evening. My father, exuding his insubstantial charm, his hand-me-down cosmopolitanism, signs us in. ‘Good evening, Shadrach.’ ‘Good evening, sir.’ ‘This is my son.‘ ‘Nice boy, sir. Big boy now. Before, small.’ Shadrach — can he be this pleased to see me?— smiles as he cups his hands to indicate the tiny creature I was previously. ‘Too big now,’ he says. Muthaiga has the same system. The privileged sign in at  a large book attached by a thin chain to a sort of lectern. The head waiter already has my name memorized. I take a stroll in the sonorous gardens. There is a sudden flurry outside the main entrance, a Gothic porch. The evening is closing, a mist rising in the hollows of the golf course. The waiters are folding napkins, the insects are tuning up vigorously, the first croaks and ululations rise from the pond, the damp earth breathes out aromatically, the exotic flowers pump out their night perfumes, the sky in the distance over the knuckles of Ngong, the direction of Masailand, flails with electricity. (It seems more like buckets of thin paint dropped from the sky than lightning.) In the Delamere rooms a pianist is playing ‘Young Love’ and from the kitchen comes a waft of roasting meat. The flurry is caused by the arrival of an old car, of a type that retains a kind of dignity as it ages. Lady De Marr arrives every evening, God willing, in this old banger. I watch her arrival. She knew Claudia very well; they used to go to parties together dressed as boys. Now Lady De Marr staggers into the front door, saluted by the guard, the askari, disdaining the proffered help of the major-domo, who wears a fez and a sash. Another man drives her car away to park it. He does this gravely, perhaps fearing — with some justification from what I can see — that the whole thing might collapse like a car in a Laurel and Hardy movie, falling absolutely fiat on to the ground in its component parts. I hear her voice complaining of the ill-manners of the police at a road block. It is a voice unaffected by the changes in articulation which have taken place since the 1930s. She pronounces the word ‘damn’ with a little gurgle of amusement: ‘Dem cheek. Bloody road block outside the club. Silly arses. Somebody should tell them to bugger orff and catch some criminals.’ Nobody can reproduce this intonation. Actors and actresses produce a version of Noël Coward when they try. I follow after an interval towards the entrance. The frogs are already deafening. Claudia Cohn-Casson often had dinner here when she was in Nairobi. She sometimes had dinner with Sir Thomas Fairfax, who tonight is having dinner with Lady De Marr. I wish to observe this, because I find the prospect of two octogenarians having dinner in the middle of Africa moving. The intensely familiar surroundings, the froggy air, the starched linen earnestly folded, even the little fake candle holders on the wall with their chintz shades, shunt my real life, my sexual wrangles with Victoria, my work, to one side. This uninvited, almost uncontrollable, welling of memory is like finding a hard splinter in the soft, flabby flesh of my real life. But also I am suffering a pleasurable and painful feeling, a feeling so often made banal by film, of time reprieved and relived. Here I am, for Chrissakes, about to dine alongside two people who knew Claudia Cohn-Casson, in surroundings she knew well, in an ambience which I know ail too well, although I have only just arrived. After dinner, like some cultural tourist, I will introduce myself to these envoys from the past. A gong booms. The sound makes small silverfish run down the back of my neck. I am, as my father used to say, going to have the works. I start with a consommé Lady Curzon. Even in the soup, the old order is commemorated."
FIC FIC-FAJ-003 0.33 "FOURTEEN I picture the old man hopping and pacing to his cottage, finding the paper, finding the passage, transcribing it, bobbing back to the club and slipping the note under my door, in order to set the record straight; I find myself close to tears. The candlelight in the room wavers in a warm draught. In the shadows and its gentle movement I believe I see the firelight which constrains and defines the Masai night. Beyond the firelight there is the unknowable. Why do we persist in trying to know everything there is to know in the belief that one day, presumably quite soon, we will succeed? One had to forget . Nabokov's words, Fairfax's words. They could easily be rephrased: one could not understand. And he was right. I had discovered some time ago that he had loved Claudia Cohn-Casson. When I wake the candle has burned right down so that in the enamel holder there is nothing but a lava flow or wax. Outside I can hear a sound which is also achingly familiar to me: someone is trimming the grass outside with shears. They chatter and stutter in the never-ending colonial quest for the perfect lawn, which is, of course, a reproach to the disorderly lives and vegetation on the outside. S. O. Letterman has entered into a very personal contract with tennis. However well he does, however badly he is beaten, he contrives to incorporate the result into his bil-dungsroman . Like Marcel Proust, he is making art out of his life, and tennis is an important element. When we played at his club in Westwood and I beat him comfortably, he discussed the result with his friends in such a way that it  was clear that he had deliberately thrown the match in order to contribute to our personal relationship. In the locker room — no ordinary changing room this, but a soft paradise of fluffy towels, hairdryers, lotions, masseurs, electronic scales, isometric drinks, cardio-vascular scans and congratulatory attendants — he told a well-known (everyone in this club is said to be well-known) producer that he took the first three games off me in each set. And then he added that, of course, writers had nothing better to do most afternoons and since I was now writing a movie for him, he knew how to keep me happy. ‘You can't let these guys get depressed,’ he said. ‘Writing is a mood business.’ Somebody told me that Letterman had had five hundred tennis lessons. It was said with a ‘whaddya expect?’ kind of intonation. Not everyone, it seems, has bought his bill of goods. Certainly his tennis has an entirely synthetic look to it. There is a small, and often fatal, time lapse before he plays each shot, as he recalls the instructions concerning grip, feet placement, racquet position and so on. None the less, his tennis has high ambitions. He has all the latest equipment-vibration dampers, elbow restraints, luminous head and wrist bands and bicycle shorts under his strangely textured tennis shorts. His racquets — there are many — are transported in a bulging bag described with a crocodile, given to him by Michel Piccoli. ‘Very brave man. He signed a petition you know against Mitterrand and Vichy. Real shame our movie never got past first base. Anyway, this bag is a little souvenir. Mitterrand wrote articles for a Vichy newspaper before he joined the Resistance. Did you know that?’ He has had plenty of flirtations with European directors and writers and claims to be a great fan of Louis Malle and Alain Resnais, but when it comes right down to it, he doesn't believe that a European sensibility sells tickets at the box office. Yet he can work both sides of the street. In argument about the treatment of the script — these things process in  ordered stages — he is just as likely to enlist Bergman as Schwarzenegger as supporting evidence. Like his tennis, his movie-making seems to lack instinct, but half an hour in the locker room and lunch on the terrace tells you everything you need to know about the constraints under which he operates. Papal bulls issued from the Hollywood Vatican flutter in the air. There are prescriptions concerning actors, restaurants, religious sects, fads, social issues and automobiles which you ignore at peril of excommunication. The insiders — and Letterman is right on the inside track — pick up these changing signals constantly; they have no patience with outsiders' scepticism. I am reminded of Letterman's tennis because as I stroll through the grounds of the club, waiting for the arrival of my transcripts, I come upon a red earth tennis court. The surface of these courts is made with a clay brought up from underground by termites, the insects which create the famous anthills of the savannah. Nobody is playing as yet, but the lines have been freshly painted, a large old roller is being stored by an elderly man with tribal scars on his cheeks (like the marks made by French grill pans on bifteck ), and a big jug of lemon squash is standing in the shade of a little thatched tennis house, protected from the desires of wasps and flies by a beaded lace doily. Beside the court a bed of yellow canna lilies, with leaves the colour of red cabbage, is being doused by another retainer, this man with a little ornament, beaded like the doily, in one of his ear lobes. The water bounces off the waxen leaves. It was Letterman's idea to use the awful journey from the house in the avenue Hoche via Drancy to Auschwitz as a recurring, dreamlike image in the film. Letterman had previously told me that flashback is a device which must be used sparingly, yet now he was a plausible advocate for this treatment. It appeals to me, too. The final, defiant round-up by the retreating Nazis, in  which Claudia and her deluded father were caught, the train journey and the selection process at Auschwitz, will all be treated in black and white, in order, if I get Letterman, to increase the realism and to reduce the melodrama. I can see that his aim is to make these scenes so powerful that they will go beyond any fictional treatment of the death camps that has ever been tried before: the train roils through the night, the outcome, although certain, appallingly delayed by the shots of the iron wheels and the crude pistons; the final scene of the five chimneys pouring their shameful smoke over the polish countryside, intercut — this is my contribution — with the smoke rising from the savannah. Letterman confided to me after one of our tennis games that my pieces in Manhattan had always struck him as somewhat trivial — artifices — until he read my piece ‘Drancy, Ante-chamber of Death’. The mundane details of the denunciations, the decrees against Jews using the telephone or travelling on the Métro and so on had brought home to him that the French had both suffered by and been complicit in the Holocaust. (I forgave the fact that he was merely paraphrasing my final sentence. He has a way of drawing you into his enterprises, which is flattering.) Still nobody comes to play tennis. The lines are painted, the canna lilies watered. The lines are perfectly straight, their whiteness defying the ochre ant soil. On the cabbage leaves of the cannas, huge, shining droplets of water repose. Letterman told me that he once saw Steffi Graf playing tennis at Wimbledon. He was seated at the back of the court, initially angry that someone had screwed up with the tickets, but he quickly realized that every few games he was almost directly behind her. Each time she bent to receive serve he  found himself staring mesmerized at her derrière . Binding me with his confidences, he said that the wonderfully athletic, Aryan rear view of Steffi Graf made him understand how the camp inmates could believe they were indeed Untermenschen in relation to the SS. He was joking, of course. He squeezed my arm to make sure I got the point. The grounds of the club lead to a golf course, but this, too, is still, except for the attentions of green-sweepers and grass-cutters. The first fairway extends up over a gentle rise and into a forest of huge, native trees. These are the only trees around the town which have not yet gone for firewood. The town has an edgy, vicious hum. The poor see the lumpy, soapy tourists and they harbour thoughts of separating them from their possessions. A short walk near the university produces the dispiriting impression that urban life in Africa is hopeless. In their smart uniforms the police have a lethargic menace. A large Mercedes rushes by with outriders; the other traffic — held together with recycled parts, bits of wire and home engineering — is swept aside dismissively, mere twigs in the path of floodwater. I wish to run up to the window of the Mercedes and shout at the general sitting there:Wake up, you fat bastard, can't you see how you look parading in this cemetery, like some overstuffed SS officer in Birkenau ? Yet when I take a taxi back to the club, the driver tells me that the Indians will be getting it in the neck soon. They are to blame for the misery and squalor. Here in the club, gardening is still practised with religious intensity. In the Third World gardening is absurd. Why grow things you can't eat? Why water luxuriant canna lilies and fast-flowering, even faster-fading, roses, trained on ropes to make living swags around the croquet lawn? Why trim the grass so short that not even a goat could get its incisors into the chlorophyl? Why spend money on fertilizers and ant poisons and petrol for the mowers and whitewash for the tennis court — and incidentally any stray rocks that  need it — and why build great steaming compost heaps of the by-products of the above? The answer is that gardens re-create a corner of paradise. For a Masai, paradise is a vast savannah, dotted with beautifully marked and horned cattle. For a westerner entering this harsh, insected and vipered landscape, a small sanctuary of parterres and walkways and pergolas and gravelled paths and granite crazy paving, was evidence of faith. As the town began to grow and at the same time fragment in strange, squalid and unforeseen ways, the gardens became symbolic in a different fashion. This garden (protected from the road on one side by huge, untidy gum trees, in a permanent state of reptilian slough, leaving the discarded bark hanging from the newly emerged, silvery trunks) has for me so powerful a charm because it returns me to my childhood, with a complete collection of odours, insects, fragrances, ponds and over-vigorous plants. But there is more to it. The texture of the sounds, the little ant-bear funnels, the twittering of the water sprinklers, the unnamed but instantly familiar birds, the patient devotions of the gardeners, the numberless frogs (now in caviare-eyed repose on water lilies and ledges), the huge, lazy tadpoles, the dragonflies on their biplane wings skimming the water, the busy red ants returning with baguettes of grass (the same ants which used to run up the shorts of children and sink their vicious fangs into unwary little scrota) and now the distant thwack of tennis bails and the inevitable muted cries of anguish — all these impressions play so strongly on my memory because they leap thirty-five years of my life in one bound. It's pleasurable and it's surprising in its detail. The question is, what on earth does it mean? Why are these memories so strong and so personal? I am sitting now in an arbour of rust-coloured bougainvillaea drinking lukewarm, weak coffee, brought to me in a stainless steel pot by a waiter in a starched white uniform, thinking in an aimless way  about this puzzle, when I see the waiter returning. He is holding a round copper tray under one arm like a subaltern with his cap at a passing-out parade. ‘Telephone, sir.’ I walk up to the main building along a path of large brown stones with the shape and texture of unleavened bread. Within their surfaces are tiny specks of quartz. This is book to me — of which the clubhouse is built and which the early settlers favoured in their pursuit of the substantial. Taking a long-distance call still causes a certain turbulence here. I am ushered reverently into a cabin and pick up the quaint hand set, which has an additional round earpiece for clamping over the spare ear, so that I see myself reflected in the glass like a radio operator or a session singer. The call fills me with apprehension. Over the airwaves and under the sea, or however his quavering voice reaches me from LA, I hear S. O. Letterman. ‘Jesus, where were you, on safari?’ ‘In the garden, reliving my childhood. I'm the proust of the savannahs.’ ‘I didn't get that last bit. This is a fucking awful line. Do you want the good news or the bad news first?’ ‘I'll take the good.’ ‘The good news is that paramount have gone for it.’ ‘And the bad?’ ‘The bad news is that they want to see a first draft script within three weeks.’ ‘Anything else?’ ‘Isn't that enough? How's it going? Okay?’ ‘Fine. I met her ex-lover last night.’ ‘Jesus, he must be one helluva age.’ ‘Seventy-six. Imagine Robert Redford with a blue face in twenty years’ time.’ ‘You been drinking?‘ ‘Yes. I have. Brandy. Kenya brandy.’ ‘At my house you told me you didn't drink. You refused all my drinks. Listen, are you pleased?’ ‘I'm elated. Well done. Congratulations.’ The truth is, I don't feel elated. I wander back out to the garden, but the magic has gone."
FIC FIC-FAJ-007 -0.71 "EIGHTEEN ‘Women make us poets, children make us philosophers.’ This is one of Letterman's aphorisms. He has a number, many quite apt, which he is liable to produce to lend substance to his conversation. His conversation is a finely wrought sales pitch. He is selling himself. It has been his life's work. The events of his life are constantly incorporated into this spiel. For example, he has been married and is still on very good terms with his wife; their divorce unlocked her true potential, and she is now a part-time feminist studies lecturer at SCU. Letterman implies that he had to divorce her for her own good; he could not bear to see so much life force confined in marriage. Their son Dylan, who is twelve, lives with her but there are no custody conflicts and they have a wonderful rapport. Dylan helps him see things in an honest fashion, without all the crap. This is the philosophical side. On the poetic side, he has had many good relationships with women. He thinks that he has a part of his nature which is more in harmony with women than men. He sees himself as having an intuitive, feminine aspect. Although he mentions it to me, he finds he is unable to display this aspect to men. It only comes out in his dealings with women. Personally I think this is another of his sales pitches. I walk up the track past the fundamentalist missions, way above the coffee plantations, up into what is nominally a wildlife reserve. I am proposing to ponder the question of Letterman's script up in the higher altitudes. A sign reads ‘Crater Reserve, please Stay in Your Vehicle.’ This sign has been painted on a piece of board and is listing badly. Some small boys come down the track towards me. They are laughing and chasing each other. When they see me they become strangely still and respectful. They probably think that, like most of the white men in this evangelical belt  between the coffee plantations and the colobus monkey habitat, I have religious connections and perhaps even powers, the sort of powers that cause money to come to pass. This is the white man's greatest achievement: he has learned how to get his mitts on the money. (There is another argument, nowadays timidly advanced only by a few academics of the old hair-shirt tendency, that the white man has fixed the game, making it almost impossible for the others to get in.) The connection between religion and wealth is clear: the religious people have almost as many vehicles, servants and supplies of electrical goods as the aid community. I give these children my benediction. It is delivered in the form of a few coins which bear the likeness of the last president, a pleasant utopian who retired of his own free will. The children, their faith reinforced, run down the hill to tell others of their good fortune as I stride up the track towards the forest. The forest is cool. I ask myself why the people don't live up here in these glades beside the rushing streams. Life would be so much more leafy. It would be almost European. At a great height I catch sight of a colobus. These monkeys are used in the manufacture of household articles and headdresses by ail the tribes in whose domain they are found. This is the sort of relationship between man and animal which westerners find hard to accept: the use of a monkey as a fly-swat. In my excited state, as the trees close over my head, I see this kind of thinking, this desire to reshape the world into something reassuring, as having many applications. For example S. O. Letterman sees Claudia's story as a vindication of the human spirit, to which, professionally anyway, he pays tribute. The human spirit, in this estimation, is always on the move, restlessly upwards like climbers on K2. I am under notice to find a suitably uplifting ending for our movie. The smoke rising from the five chimneys of Auschwitz-Birkenau is a downer, although he thinks there may be something in my idea of complementary smoke rising from the savannah. ‘It's crazy, but people just won't go to the movies if the thing ends on a downer.’ I don't argue with Letterman. Why should I? He's an expert on popular taste. He sees Claudia as brainy, beautiful, romantic and symbolic. The last part of the proposition still needs some work. I have decided to broaden my idea of the savannahs with smoke rising from the Masai villages. I see the camera closing to find her old Masai friends gathering after a day, another of the infinite number of days, spent caring for the cattle. The ex-hunter, aviator and war hero, Tom Fairfax, who was her lover, is approaching in his biplane. First his small plane is seen searching the vast plains for her village. The sky is reddening, reminding the viewer of the ghastly hues of the night sky above Auschwitz when the ovens were working at full capacity. Down below, fires are being lit and the cattle are being driven gently into the enclosures of thorn bushes. Music rises on the soundtrack. Fairfax's plane circles once and then comes down to land bumpily on a piece of gazelle-inhabited ground. The warriors come loping for news of Claudia. Fairfax climbs from the plane and walks, surrounded by the tall warriors, across the darkening savannah to the laibon's manyatta. The laibon, dressed in his traditional finery, a cloak of fur on his shoulders and carrying a thin stick, walks across the enclosure, now thick with the strangely blotched cattle, their huge horns gently meshing and unmeshing, to greet Fairfax. The moment is prolonged and intensified almost unbearably. (The music, I will suggest, should be based on Masai chanting.) Anyway, this music rises hauntingly. The laibon and Fairfax face each other. They speak in Maa, but with subtitles. Fairfax tells them that Claudia is dead. There is a throaty murmur, a sort of groan. The laibon asks who killed her. Fairfax says she was killed by the Germans. He takes a piece of paper from his pocket, a letter from Claudia smuggled to him from the Drancy camp in Paris. He tells them that Claudia has written them a last message. He clears his throat, which is suddenly  somewhat congested, and reads: ‘Whatever happens to me, I shall always be thinking of you and hoping that you will have green grass for your cattle.’ From the Masai this deeply human murmur rises again. Night is falling. Fairfax stands surrounded by warriors with their spears, women holding their children, cattle and goats jostling; the music rises. The subtitles now roil over this scene. They tell the audience that Claudia Cohn-Casson, born 1912, is believed to have died in Auschwitz on or about 20 April 1945, fifteen days before Germany surrendered. I am panting now. The air is thinning. There is nobody in the forest although it is loud with calls and cries. A small antelope races away into the bush. For a moment before it separates itself from its surroundings I catch a glimpse of its round eyes, beautiful but stupid, taking in the sight of a forty-three-year-old writer wearing shorts and a faded polo shirt, his face somewhat craggier than he sees it in his mind's eye, his waist a little more solid and his eyes bright with the thoughts he is generating. Almost immediately it has vanished, able somehow to levée and jetée through the undergrowth without a sound. Further away I hear colobus monkeys again, crashing about like drunks after a party, but all I see is branches in motion semaphoring their passing. I think that Letterman will go for my new ending. I am light-headed, perhaps from a mild attack of altitude sickness. In a gap in the trees I can now look down over a green vegetable pointillism of tree-tops, falling away down to the town. It takes me another two hours to reach the top, which provides a view down into the crater which looks, from this height, like a small, almost perfectly oval park with artfully sited clumps of trees and lakes. On the other side of the rim I can see way over the savannah in the direction of the Mountain of God, which is reduced in size so that I can't be sure which of the outcrops on the horizon it is. From below, in the Bible belt, I hear hymn singing."
FIC FIC-FAJ-011 0.49 "TWENTY-TWO The canvas of my tent (to be exact, not canvas but a green plastic material) is flapping in the breeze which comes over the plains and stirs the dry leaves where they lie on the bottom of the dry river. Outside, the embers of my fire glow as the breeze fans them. A lion roars in the dense thicket into which the watercourse runs. Over at the laibon's engang they are bedded down behind their own thicket of thorn bushes, the cattle jammed together in a large boma and the goats in a smaller one right in the middle, as far from the athletic leopards as possible. My travel alarm glows in the dark. It is four thirty in the morning. I am out here alone, unprotected, only a thin piece of plastic-canvas away from lions, buffalo, leopards and hyena. But I am more disturbed by the sharp, diving whine of a mosquito, which produces an anticipatory tension by its frequency alone, just like the moment when the dentist turned on his drill and swung the whole clumsy contraption over my youthful, gaping mouth. I wonder if the children in the engang are frightened. Our own children are now so far removed from danger, at least of the primal kind, and these Masai are so close to it, that you would expect them to be cowed and fearful. Outside the engang is a night world into which the Masai never venture. It is a combat zone which they concede to the predators until morning, when they drive out their cattle again past sleeping lions and strangely reticent hyena. The children are left out on the plains with a few goats from a very young age. Yet as they step forward for a greeting, receiving the palms of your hands on their springy hair, they show no sign of fear or anxiety. With their monsters and wolves and unpredictable dangers, fairy stories are supposed to prepare children for life in some symbolic fashion. Here the dangers are real. In the few weeks that have gone by a  boy from the village has been killed by an elephant. If my understanding is correct, the boy was looking for a missing goat on the edge of the thicket when he was charged by a cow elephant and killed. There is no mourning for children; by the next day the body was eaten by the hyenas. There is a compensation scheme and the laibon wishes me to drive one of his sons fifty miles to a small town to collect the papers. My arrival and my anticipated help with the paperwork have been fortuitous. I don't like to ask how much money they will receive from the government, but the laibon tells me: seventy-five dollars, the price of two new cows. I realize that the forty-nine cows that were offered to the district officer's relatives was a huge sum, however you measure it. And the district officer's family got nothing. Dawn is approaching. The roof of the tent begins to glow, like the mantle of a gas lamp turned up very slowly. It is cool outside as I throw a log on the gently breathing embers. I put the kettle, already nicely blackened and battered, into the pile of ash and climb back into my camp bed. Wakefulness at this time of day is notoriously unsettling: in London it brings balls of anxiety to the gut as the sodden city outside sneers at the sleepless. Here I feel awake and ready, compelled to be on my feet when the sun reaches us, and the cattle, fretful and peckish, are released in a torrent of bay and brown and white, their huge horns gradually unlocking and separating as they spread out into the plain. The warriors always accompany them when they must travel long distances to find green grass. Green grass, green grass. Pre-dawn. Claudia lying in her hut listening for the first sounds of life. A satisfying pile of notes and tapes accumulating. The tapes, the same ones I have back at Mr Shah's cumin-scented hotel, neatly stacked on a shelf made from a tea-chest draped with Somali cloth. Over at the engang they  are starting their fires into life. Is Claudia longing for her Masai lover? When and where does he visit her? The emptiness of the landscape is illusory; there is no privacy here. A warrior will plant his spear outside one of the small huts to indicate that he is inside and should not be disturbed, but I can't imagine Claudia, chic Parisienne, et cetera, allowing her relationship to be semaphored in this way from outside her own hut. As I lie here under the green, seaweedy tent I remember from some trite television interview, a remark made by Brigitte Bardot, loopy Parisienne, namely that in all her many love affairs she was off at the first sign of the waning of passion. Perhaps Claudia grew tired of Tepilit. Perhaps the cultural divide was emphasized by being lovers and she quickly found she had nothing to say to him. Victoria and I have undoubtedly passed that milepost. Victoria thinks that I am not sufficiently in love with her to want children. Even the most liberated women believe that there is an evident connection between sex and children, a notion whose truth is only tested after the event. After her unfaithfulness, I found the connection severed. If the purpose of sex is to have children, then, is there a special sort of casual, slightly illicit sex with near-strangers which has nothing to do with procreation and is also more exciting than the other steady sort? (The wronged one feels entitled to the interrogatory role.) ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Was it more exciting?’ ‘Don't.’ ‘You know what I mean. The whole business. Getting clothes off, zippers, panties, his cock, what he wants to do to you and you to him.’ ‘You make it sound sort of mechanical.’ ‘Oh, so it was not sort of mechanical, but quite tender with a lot of cosy conversation? How nice.’ ‘Oh, Jesus.’ ‘What I mean is, why can't you just admit that it was wonderfully exciting to fuck somebody else?’ ‘How stupid do you think I am? If I say it was wonderfully exciting, you will wonder when I am going to do it again, and if I say it was a mistake, which it was, you are going to ask me under what circumstances it might not have been a mistake.’ ‘Actually, I could ask you a lot more interesting questions than that.’ ‘I know, like how big his cock was and so on. But these are not questions that come into it.’ ‘Did he come in your mouth?’ ‘Please. I have apologized, I have grovelled. I can't do any more. I just hope it will pass. That's the accepted wisdom.’ ‘Time is the great healer.’ The trouble is I don't want to be healed.’ ‘You don't want to be healed because it means you don't have to justify running away.’ I'm the injured party, yet she is suffering more than I am. The sun is now striking the tent and the trees around, producing an underwater effect on my green tent like kelp swaying in a tide. I clamber out of bed. I have to make a great effort to keep the tent tidy. It's amazing how quickly my few possessions become disarranged. Claudia lived here for nearly four years, creating a small, domestic homestead. Often she would go to Nairobi or the coast for a break and to get supplies. The fire burns evenly with a thin hot flame, as though there are no oils or resins in the wood. I am drinking my coffee from a tin mug, bacon frying in the pan and scenting the air, and toasting a large slice of bread on a fork, as the bee-eaters begin their busy day and the vervet monkeys start  to squabble. Although I know that in these matters there is almost no limit to what people will do, I am horrified that Victoria should have subjected herself to an Aids test and — as I have heard happens — the offers of emotional counselling and financial advice. My heart, however, does not respond in the desired way to her letter and certificate. I see it as a silly gesture springing from her work in advertising, the promotion of appearance over substance. What she won't want to hear is that I am cured of the madness which kept me from sleeping at night and the imagination which played havoc with my peace of mind during the day. This seems to be the way it is with men and women; buckets of water from a well, one drawing deep while the other is empty, and so on, as if there is a physical law governing the amount of emotional nourishment available to a couple. Bardot with her crazy affection for animals, Claudia and her unspeakable death, Victoria and her Aids test: I see them all linked in some fashion. I see women as closer to the tragic than men because of the frailty of their expectations which have no solid foundation in the world. I see their hopes like Masai villages, impermanent and leaving few marks on the landscape. Of course, I could never tell any woman these thoughts. Perhaps, like Letterman, I think of myself as having some useful feminine understanding. The bacon is strongly scented, very porcine; in the pan it is not going brown but looking more like a slice of pig than bacon should. I prod it with a fork and brown it on the fire before introducing it to the thick slice of toast. Another cup of coffee is ready as I bite into my breakfast. It's surprisingly good even though the presentiments of pig are confirmed by the taste. I throw the rind, as thick as a pencil, in the direction of the vervet monkeys, but they show no understanding of my offer. Nobody has ever donated anything to them before. From across the open stretch of ground hemmed in by the watercourse and the thicket, from at least half a mile  away, I can clearly hear the engang preparing for the damburst of cattle. I hurry over in that direction. I am impelled there. The grass is so dry it seems impossible that it can ever come to life again: yet the huge acacia trees along the riverbed are putting out blossom, delicate sprigs of green in anticipation of the rains to come. Mana. The old anthropological concept dreamed up in the universities to describe the potentialities of nature as understood by primitive people. As I stride across the plain I feel I have a glimmering of what it means. It means a nervous dependence upon nature, a relationship with a step-parent who can never be entirely relied upon. Non-stop vigilance and propitiation are advisable. The importance of trying to keep in nature's good books is plain as the cattle call and stamp impatiently. Today the laibon is expecting me to take his son in the Toyota. His son is standing near the main entrance, ready for the journey, carrying a stick, a spear and a small leather bottle, similar to the sort of thing drunken youths use to squirt wine down their throats before braving the bulls in Pamplona. (I have done this myself although no bull came anywhere near me.) The cattle are thin and some are listless but so far there have been no deaths. The young men split the cattle into two groups and head off to find pasture. Two girls are loading the donkeys with water containers and sacks. They greet me, but they are amused by my appearance. I see them discussing me; one of them doubles up. They compose themselves as the laibon appears and suggests we sit down for tea. With a few whacks and some loud whistles, they drive the donkeys out of the enclosure. The laibon's face is always troubled, as though the thoughts which are his special preserve are weighing on him heavily. He drinks the tea brought to us by the koko gravely, and makes exasperated noises. The laibon's son, paramat, and I walk back to my camp. He is tall with an elongated, finely made face, a Masai face, lending some weight to the myth that the Masai came from the Nile. When he smiles, he looks slightly goofy, the skin pulled right over his cheeks like the face children make by sticking their fingers in the corners of their mouths."
FIC FIC-FAJ-014 0.0900000000000001 "TWENTY-FIVE The koko served us tea as we sat in the middle of the boma after the cattle had gone. (We were probably sitting on about three feet of dried dung, crumbly and friable.) She poured the tea into large enamel mugs. I had seen the donkeys plodding reluctantly up the escarpment to fetch water miles away. Donkeys are not natural enthusiasts; they walk as if they have arthritis. I felt guilty that this hard-won water should be wasted on a tea ritual when I had gallons of mineral water at my camp. But she ministered to us as the tape-recorder whirred. The tea was loaded with sugar, and milk from a gourd was added in a thin stream like milk being drawn from a cow's udder. As she was pouring the tea it occurred to me that maybe she knew Claudia too. She was the first of the laibon's four wives many years ago. Now she is a benign presence which gives the engang a heart. I am now reading Uitsmijter's transcript of what the laibon had on his mind. The owl of Minerva flies as dusk is falling: the laibon believes he is not long for this earth. He has had some revelations which he wants to pass on to me. They are that the rains are going to cease falling and, because of the restrictions placed on their movement, the Masai will not be able to follow their tradition of moving on. As I read, it seems to me that this is not his literal meaning. He is voicing the complaint of all old people about the closing down of their universe. Death is the removal of all the possibilities which sustain us in our lives. But also, I guess, he is exercising his right as a laibon to prophesy. Headmasters, senators, judges, priests all see themselves as having a particular duty in this regard. A politician invited to make the wedding speech can be relied upon to dish up some  predictions along with the eternal verities. The laibon retells the accounts of his illustrious ancestors of the great migration from the North. He wants me, for some reason, to realize that he knows the lights are going out in the Masai world. He sees that finally the Masai myths have been overtaken. He tells me of a great battle his ancestors fought near Lake Victoria. He speaks of a battle against the Germans. He prophesies a war of the Masai against the townies. (I wonder if he realized that there are serried ranks of townies behind the front line that he has encountered.) The pebbles he has thrown have shown these things. The uprising against the townies will take place after the next eunoto, which is the gathering of thousands of warriors at the end of their time as morans. Thousands of warriors collect from the huge Masai district to have their heads shaved by their mothers before undergoing rituals to launch them on their new — somewhat dull — life as elders. There is no music, only the hoarse, erratic bellow of a kudu horn and the chanting, a strange noise which comes from inside the earth itself, as though the rocks and the soil were singing as best they could. The infinite possibilities of Masai life, on the face of it a simple desire to wander the earth following the cattle, have been denied. Every single thing the Masai value depends upon this possibility. This is the object of life. It is life. Uitsmijter, under the academic compulsion to explain, adds a note about the nature of prophecy among the Masai and — the comparative method — among other tribes such as the Dinka and the Nuer. Prophecy is expected of the laibons. It is usually expressed in the vaguest terms, like a horoscope in the newspapers. Another disciple of Nostradamus, S. O. Letterman, has been throwing the pebbles in LA and finds the omens good. So far no progress with the female lead. But Mel Gibson likes the treatment, which Letterman himself has had to work up  a little. In principle he would like to do the movie, but you know how it is with agents. (I don't, as a matter of fact, but this is the chummy method at work.) In many ways the time is right — fiftieth anniversary, uncertainties in the world, French self-examination and so on— for just such a movie. It feels right. The response is good. He is off to Paris to interview actresses. This sounds like a wonderful opportunity for Letterman to bring to bear his feminine understanding on eager actresses, although something tells me that his Californian slightly-absurd-boyish-middle-aged charm will not go down well in Paris. I wonder if what Mencken called ‘the usual hypocrisies’ aren't too well understood by women in Paris. I am sure that Letterman would like to have some of Polanski's assurance with young women, a knowingness which makes the Californian mania for self-presentation look quaint. The success — I am looking out of the window at the thickly carpeted mountainside — comes from the knowledge of shared weakness, the weakness of both men and women in matters of sex and passion. It does not arise, as Letterman imagines, from impressing on women your sympathy and sensitivity to their imagined plight. This is why bastards continue to score heavily with women who should know better. For all his working of the flesh and his golden suntan and his deployment of pop philosophies and credos, Letterman is too contrived an individual to be successful with the sort of Frenchwoman — my gaze descends from the mountain to my backyard where they are pegging out a goatskin — whom he desires to play the part of Claudia. But I can't be sure."
FIC FIC-FAJ-016 -0.18 "TWENTY-SEVEN I am waiting for Tom Fairfax. For an elderly man he has a great many demands on his time. He is a polo umpire, a judge of horseflesh, adviser to the Farmers' Union, a stalwart of regimental dinners and a confidant of opposition politicians. Letterman sees the role of historical adviser in the way that he sees the role of writer, only less so. The historical adviser is there not to ensure verisimilitude, but to be an accomplice in furthering the aims of the producer. When I tell him that Fairfax seems to have played a very big part in Claudia's life, he doesn't see any problem. Great news, he says. As far as he is concerned, nobody cares how accurate our portrayal of Claudia's love life is. He cites Out of Africa . But Karen Blixen did not end up in Auschwitz, I reply. We are not making a documentary — get him on side if you can. Fifteen thousand for the research. Mr Shah, although he does not comment, appears less concerned about my bill now. Letterman's expansive style is getting to him. But I don't bring up the subject of money with Fairfax immediately. I ask him to come down for a few days and I also invite Lady De Marr. I offer to book them into the hotel, owned by an airline, which carries on a heroic but losing battle for French standards. The hotel operators are only here because of some trade-off between governments. This has resulted in a restaurant which serves the regional specialities of France to bemused locals. One woman, a party official's wife, is said by the Anglican vicar to have eaten twenty-one croustades of morels in a sauce of cream and truffle, with a vapeur of Armagnac, in the belief that she was fostering international relations. (The vicar ate the other four. Absolutely delicious.) But Fairfax has made his own  arrangements. He will be staying at a coffee plantation on the edge of town. Lady De Marr will not be coming. Letterman tells me that casting in Paris is going well. He has a short list. Candice Riberon who was in a thriller called Le Métro is his favourite so far, but there is a long way to go. I have seen Métro . It opens with a very long sex scene in a small apartment. On the bed lies Candice Riberon. For a few agonizing minutes the camera holds on her face as she experiences — she hardly seems to be enjoying — sexual attentions out of the range of the camera. Her face is very mobile. Her eyes close, open, close again. Her lips move in an anguished chewing motion, so that her mouth widens and closes, a fevered sea-urchin. Now the camera begins to move down her body, over her breasts, which are lightly beaded (and quite widely separated) although it is hard to tell in the chiaroscuro created, as we are soon to find out, by the shutters of the apartment. As the camera moves down her body, which is undulating beneath its gaze, almost vibrating, and leaves her navel behind, it comes to a dark, tousled shape, not clearly visible in the low levels of light. Immediately the audience believes — I certainly believed — that somebody is eating her pussy. We do not see his face, but we see her hands clutching his head. It is moving up and down in an ever increasing tempo. She climaxes and pushes the face away. It is turned in this action towards the meagre amount of light, light which has a density and texture not often seen in real life, created by filling the air with smoke and piercing it with tungsten light. The camera holds this face. The eyes are open but they are unseeing. There is blood coming out of his ears. The camera cuts to Candice, dressing. Her body is boyish, her breasts quite full, a very dark, dense thicket just disappearing as her skirt is pulled up. The titles roll: MÉTRO. Un Film de Jean-Claude Reed . It is a shocking scene, because it starts by involving the audience in its raw eroticism and then turns on them, so that they feel guilty for the stirrings they have inevitably been experiencing. After  this virtuoso shot, the rest of the film is disappointing, often silly, but I remember thinking how well Candice Riberon handled the rather artificial dialogue. I remember, too, her strangely spaced cheekbones and severely cut hair. She is a serial killer who picks up men in the Métro. I can imagine S. O. Letterman being drawn to her. I try to see her as Claudia. In this movie she adopts a coldly dismissive tone with men — her lovers and les flics — which is supposed to be chic, and she is placed rather artificially in perfectly arranged and photographed surroundings. Her ostensible job is something in advertising or public relations, but this is laughable: people are always rushing off to catch planes or to have showdowns with clients or engage in unmotivated conspiracies to deceive the public. There is something so fatally trivial about this movie in its elevation of appearance over substance, that I feel an irrational resistance to her as Claudia. Of course I know that movie actresses often cannot choose their roles. For a start they are in a race against the clock: by the time they have the clout to choose the right roles, they are too old for them. Producers and directors adore very young women. Like the Masai, they think you can stay young by sleeping with young women. The filming of young actresses is a sexual act. But I can't prevent myself thinking that the person who is to play Claudia should possess a clearly defined personality of her own. This is crazy, because I have not yet been able to decide what Claudia was like. I want Fairfax to tell me, but I don't hold out much hope. The hotel is quiet. Outside, the cottage industries have taken a rest as the heat of the afternoon settles heavily on the town like an unwelcome blanket. The earth throws off the heat it cannot accommodate. As I lie on my bed I can feel it coming in the window. It is like an open oven in a kitchen, giving off gusts of heat. I am almost asleep. I think of Claudia and Victoria and Candice and I compare their facial motions in an impertinent fashion. Mr Shah wakes me. I am drained and startled. The mountain outside is darkening. He apologizes and hands me a note: Sir Thomas Fairfax is expecting me for dinner at Folly Farm. ‘I am afraid I have come to the conclusion, reluctantly, that the different people and races of the world were never intended to meet. For thousands of years, hundreds of thousands, they stuck to their own backyards. When they did run into each other on the borders of their territories, they usually tried to kill each other. primitive people regarded themselves as the only humans. In their languages they described themselves as ‘the man’ or ‘the human’. The idea that we ail belong to one human family is a relatively recent one. Of course Claudia believed it.’ Fairfax and I are sitting on the verandah at Folly Farm. He is able to re-create his own world wherever he goes. He has no taste for the new world, either in Africa or in Europe. He was once a director of the company which owned this coffee estate, and he seems to have squatter's rights here for life. The manager is on holiday at the coast and Fairfax has seventeen rooms and six servants at his disposal. The verandah is long and overgrown with climbing plants, which are wrapped around the varnished poles that support the tin roof. Our drinks are served on elephants' feet which make good side-tables and were once popular as souvenirs. You can't give them away now. ‘I think’, he says, ‘that the Germans had convinced themselves that there was something noble in their quest to clean up the world. They were acting in the interests of western civilization. When I was in Germany at the end of the war, I met hundreds of Germans who tried to explain this to me. They were upset that their efforts had been  misunderstood. It was quite offensive really, particularly to me, this desire for a pat on the back.’ We are edging nearer to the subject of Claudia, who, so far, has not been mentioned by name. We are silent now. The insects are egging him on. ‘Look, old chap, I'm sorry about the note at the club. I must have been tight. I hope you didn't mind.’ ‘I was touched. Please don't apologize.’ ‘Tell me what you want to know from me and I'll see if I can oblige,’ he says, after another pause slashed and stabbed by the insect life. ‘I want to know what she was like, and I want to clear up some questions which have been puzzling me and which don't appear on the record.’ ‘Fire away. Or perhaps I had better have another brandy first.’ He rings a bell. The mountain rises above us, now completely black against a sky which is spangled (what a charming, folksy word) with jagged sugar crystals. ‘Do you want one?’ he asks. ‘I don't drink. Despite what you saw at the club. I gave up a few years ago.’ The servant, a white-coated padder trained for the infrequent appearance of people like us, goes off on the long march to the kitchens. We sit here, comfortably wrapped up by the night. I can see that England would be anathema to Fairfax. Here, with his little moustache, each hair as thick as a fishing line, and his noble, gelid face, he counts for something. There, he would be another old person elbowed and nudged by the hordes in their restive wildebeest migration in search of gratification. But we can't start the serious business until the brandy arrives. We are like small boys on a high diving board, making excuses. ‘How is Lady De Marr?’ I ask. ‘Camilla is a wonderful woman. By the way, she has sent some letters and notes for you. She and Claudia were very  close for a while. But she hasn't been well. She has a problem with some little gland or other, which can throw her right off balance. There's no proper treatment out here but she refuses to go home. Home. I can think of nothing more awful than England for us. It's a nightmare. I can't understand a word they're saying on the television and the streets of London seem to be full of people in tennis clothes. I nearly married Camilla in the fifties, but it wouldn't have worked. We were friends, never lovers. Can I ask you one thing?’ ‘Please do.’ ‘Is there any money in this historical adviser business? I didn't like to ask earlier.’ I tell him the amount Letterman has promised. ‘Bugger me. Well, I'll be blowed.’ My mind turns, trivially, to the shot of Candice Riberon having posthumous oral sex. ‘Have you got time to come out and see the laibon with me?’ I ask. ‘My dear Tim,’ he says, ‘fifteen thousand dollars is slightly more than my annual pension.‘ The brandy arrives. His whole life, like my very early life, has been punctuated by these soothing ceremonies. Servants throw a reticulation over the day, giving it some order. They are always busy with the morning coffee, the lunch, the tea and sponge cake, the drinks, the dinner. The Masai, I have read, cannot understand our preoccupation with eating; it fills our day. In France every other truck on the road is carrying food —poulets from Bresse, melons from Cavaillon, Camembert from Normandy. There is something risible about this mania. ‘Where do you want to begin?’ he asks. His right eye is tired, so that it lags minutely behind the other. He bombards the brandy with a violent infusion of soda from the large siphon. The brandy releases its poisonous fumes into the air already richly scented by unknown blooms. ‘Where shall we begin?’"
FIC FIC-FAJ-019 0.07 "THIRTY It is dawn. The first rays of the sun are just touching the summit of the Mountain of God. In a cleft in the escarpment beside a stream is a camp of a few tents. There is also a hut with a thatched roof and beside it a store room of split poles. The main tent stands near the stream away from the others. It has a thatched roof over it. It is open on one side to the view of the mountain across the valley. Seen through the mosquito netting are Tom Fairfax and Claudia Cohn-Casson. She lies asleep on her bed, which is draped in a mosquito net, now tied back. Fairfax leaves the tent and walks over to the fire. He starts to rearrange the still-smouldering logs, fanning them into flame. He places some more logs from a pile near by onto the fire and pushes an old, blackened kettle into the middle of the newly revived flames. He rubs his hands. It is still quite dark in the tent. Claudia opens her eyes. They are greeted by the magnificent vista of the plain and the strange, but familiar, shape of Ol Doinyo Lengai, which is steadily catching fire at its summit as the sun rises. She is naked and makes no attempt to cover any more of herself than people do who are all alone. Fairfax returns with two enamel mugs and a brown teapot on a tray. He passes her a cup. Outside the sunlight has raced down the slope of the mountain and has almost reached the floor of the valley. ‘I love you,’ he says, placing her tea beside the bed and sipping his own. She is lying on her back; her breasts adjust to a new position tardily as though they contain some viscous substance, set fling gradually as she raises herself on her elbow. ‘Thomas, je t'aime.’ ‘Thomas. You make it sound suave. Thom-as.‘ They drink tea. They are at ease. Outside cowbells can be heard and in the distance a group of Masai enters the landscape driving their animals; despite the fierce colours of their robes, completely at home in this brown and ochre world. Fairfax puts down his tea. They kiss. In the police cells the Masai warrior, Tepilit, lies on the mud floor. He is roused by the sergeant, accompanied by armed askaris. When he stands up he is handcuffed. The handcuffs are cumbersome, perhaps little used, and it takes an askari a long time to adjust them to Tepilit's thin wrists. Tepilit is led by the askaris out of the small police station to a waiting van, which drives off down the track in a billowing cloud of dust. Fairfax is driving down the same track in the opposite direction. He arrives at the police station. The sergeant comes out to meet him. ‘What's happened?’ ‘I'm afraid he's been sent off to the railway, sir. We had orders from the DC.’ ‘When did he go?’ ‘He went this morning, sir, just after dawn. To meet the midday train.’ He looks at his watch. ‘He'll be on the train by now, sir.’ ‘I see. Did you tell the DC I was here?’ ‘He knew, sir. He would know. There are not many white people in this district.’ ‘Does the man's family know what's going on?’ ‘We haven't had a chance to tell them that he's gone for trial yet, sir. To tell the truth I'm not sure it would make much difference. They don't understand our system at all. We tried to get witnesses for the defence, but they ail confirmed that he had killed the DO on purpose. That, as far as they were concerned, was the whole idea. ‘Yes, he did kill the DO. How many cows is his family asking?’ That's  how they saw it, sir. Ail they've done is sign his death warrant for him.‘ ‘Do you think he should be hanged?’ ‘It's not for me to say, sir. But I think it would be a shame.’ They stand for a moment locked by their feelings in an awkward embrace. Around them cicadas are screaming at the sun. ‘Do you want a cup of tea, sir?’ ‘No, thanks, I have to be going.’ Claudia has been weeping. She and Fairfax stand beside the stream in front of her tent. He has an arm lightly around her, his hand cupping the point of her shoulder. ‘Will they hang him?’ ‘I will go and see the governor tomorrow. I'll explain the problems with the Masai evidence to him.‘ ‘Do you think he will listen to you?’ ‘I'll do my best. I want you to come as soon as you can.’ ‘It's finished for me here. I can't go on with these people. How can I speak to them? I will come as soon as I can.’ ‘You can stay at my house.’ ‘I would like that. I must write my thesis. Just for a few weeks.’ ‘And then?’ ‘We will see.’ ‘Claudia, I will move heaven and earth. Please try not to think about it.’ ‘They just want to take him away and hang him. Finish. As quick as possible. That's the truth. You know it.’ ‘Unfortunately, he did kill someone. Ail the witnesses say the same thing.’ ‘Of course. They think it is an honourable thing. Already that day is famous among the Masai. The day the muzungu was killed. Will you walk with me?’ They walk up the cleft in the hills beside the stream and  begin to climb above the valley. Now, across the savannah, they can see the Masai village. They stop beside some huge aloes, spiky plants with red flowers, where sunbirds hover and dart. ‘I have lived here for more than four years. I don't want any other home.’ ‘Do you know, almost all of us who have lived out here prefer the bush and a tent? I don't believe we are so far from the nomad as people in Europe believe. Tell me, what have you discovered about the Masai? What is your thesis about?’ ‘You know the main idea, the academic idea, is to understand where they fit into human society. We must compare with other societies. But the more I know them, the more I ask myself the question, ‘What is the purpose?’ I find that I am writing a kind of completely sterile account of their life. It is like writing a family biography using anthropology terms. Do you know what I trying to say?’ ‘I do. I believe I do.’ ‘Your birthday anniversary would be described as a ritual exchange of gifts designed to cement clan relationships. For a researcher like me, you are not supposed to become involved. How can you not be involved? If some child is sick. If someone needs some clean water. It's impossible. And now I have been responsible for getting this man hanged. I have been a disaster for these people.’ She sits on a rock. Fairfax crouches beside her, African style. ‘You are not responsible and you haven't been a disaster. Your thesis will help them because it will enable people outside to understand their life.’ ‘Thomas, in Europe millions of people are being killed. Nobody cares about a few thousand Masai. Why should they? I am here making recordings of the Masai singing about cows and meanwhile my father is sitting in Paris pretending to be a man of the world, a saviour of his people while they are being sent off to be killed.’ ‘Hang on. That's a bit exaggerated. Don't be too  gloomy. The war will be over in nine or ten months at the most.’ ‘You know, my father thinks he has somehow mastered the situation. He, of all the Jews in Paris, has been able to understand the character of the Nazis. He is the only one who is doing his duty. It's crazy. He must come out before it's too late. And my brother must come out, too. He is only eleven years old. Will you help me arrive to Paris?’ ‘Just wait a few months and we will go as tourists.’ They rise and walk back down the valley. In the distance over the mountain, thunder sounds. The noise is like kindling crackling. On the landing strip, Fairfax says goodbye to Claudia, who stands, subdued but beautiful, at a short distance from the plane. A few Masai look on. There is lightning in the sky. Fairfax walks to the plane. He removes the chocks and starts the plane by hand. Claudia's face is obscured by the dust which rises. Soon we see the plane bumping along the runway. Fairfax waves. The plane rises unsteadily into the air. Claudia's brown eyes well with tears. She stands for a long moment. A twisted filament of lightning signals a constriction of the atmosphere. It is accompanied by the distant rise of Masai singing. In this landscape she seems, despite the onlookers, completely lost. We fear for her. She turns back towards her camp. We hear the distant — and growing more distant — engine of the plane, a whine underlaid by an occasional choking sob. A small Masai boy, carrying two whittled sticks, joins her and they walk together. The moment is poignant. The sky is full. The singing overwhelms us. A small colonial town. The main street, which circles round a clocktower, is busy. A broad road, with a park on one side, leads to the small stone law court, a modest Palladian  building. In the street outside the court, Indian traders, a few Masai and the occasional European in military or tropical kit pass by. Inside the courtroom. The Masai, Tepilit, is standing handcuffed between two policemen in the dock as the circuit judge enters. The policemen push down on Tepilit's shoulders as the judge takes his seat to indicate that he, too, should sit. The judge wears a wig. He is short of time. ‘Who represents this man?‘ ‘He has pleaded guilty, my lord,’ says a senior policeman. ‘He has no defence?’ ‘No, my lord. He pleads guilty as charged.’ ‘Ask him if he understands the charge fully.’ The court interpreter exchanges words with Tepilit. ‘Yes, my lord. He understands the charge. He killed this man.’ ‘All right. I will pass sentence tomorrow when I have seen all the papers. Take him away. Who is next?’ Fairfax waits in an echoing anteroom of the governor's office. He is summoned by a male secretary. The governor is sitting at a broad gilt table. He stands up and extends his hand. He is about sixty, tail, thin and elegant. ‘Tom, how are you?’ ‘I'm fine, sir. Fine. Very good of you to see me at such short notice.’ ‘What can I do for you?’ ‘Well, I wanted to see you two days ago, sir, but my plane was grounded by storms. It's a matter of clemency for a Masai. The facts seem cut and dried, but I am afraid there has been a grave misunderstanding. You know the Masai.’ ‘I used to love watching Lord Delamere's chaps going out with the cattle carrying umbrellas. Marvellous sight.’ ‘Yes, sir. I have seen it.’ ‘Wonderful chaps. Can't help thinking that they are on the right track and it's we who are barking up the wrong tree. That's not for publication. So what is the problem?’ ‘Well, sir, I went down to see Claudia Cohn-Casson, the anthropologist, whom I have known slightly on and off, whenever she came up to town, over the last few years.’ ‘And rather a beauty, incidentally.’ ‘So they say, sir. It seems the Masai man who killed the DO down there was under a misapprehension. He believed the order had been given to kill him by the DO. It was an interpretation problem, sir, with a rather rum Nandi interpreter who has since run away. Anyway, the Masai threw a spear and it struck the DO.’ The governor speaks to his secretary. ‘I'll just get the papers. How's the army? Looking forward to getting back to your farm, I should think? What's your guess on the invasion of France? January's probably too soon. May, June. Ah, here we are. I see. I'm afraid he was sentenced to death yesterday.’ ‘But it's only four days since I saw him.’ ‘It's policy now to get these things done with all dispatch. There just aren't enough policemen and warders to feed them and so on. I must say, it seems quite clear that he intended to kill the DO. Wretched business. You can enter an appeal for clemency, of course. But don't let your heart rule your head.’ Fairfax stands up. Thank you, sir., ‘Goodbye, Tom. This whole awful war will be over soon and we can get back to normal, thank God.’ Fairfax turns towards the door. ‘Tom. You going to be able to turn out for the polo team?’ ‘I hope so, sir.’ ‘Good show.’"
FIC FIC-FAJ-021 -0.26 "THIRTY-TWO My personal circumstances. Avid as I am for details of Claudia's personal life, I have lost interest in the details of my own. Like pascal, I wish to live quietly in my room, which I have interpreted as my head. Victoria has slipped from that part of the head where pressing thoughts gather, taking with her a lot of the baggage that was cluttering up the hallways. The sexual longings, the accusations, the lubricious details. All gone, for the moment anyway. As a teenager I was worried by the battle between the sexual thoughts and the more exalted impulses going on in me. I see now that these were just the first skirmishes in a never-ending guerrilla war. These are not the personal circumstances I recount to Fairfax. I don't tell him why I was so keen to accept a commission which involved six weeks in Africa, from a fading and somewhat ridiculous Hollywood producer. Even as I am recounting the edited version, it occurs to me that Fairfax has probably been doing the same thing. What I tell him is the background to my commission to write the script. I tell him how it all started with an article about French involvement in the transportations from Paris. I tell him that the idea of investigating the life of a beautiful French anthropologist, who, in common with seventy thousand other Jews from France, was gassed (in a crowd, indistinguishable to the SS as the laibon's cattle are to me), was my starting point. My piece on Claudia Cohn-Casson had moved S. O. Letterman, the well-known Hollywood producer, to commission me to write a script. And here I am. Here we are, by a redolent log fire, in a world which has slipped from sight. I can't tell him how this exercise fits into the human background. I leave out many things that matter. We all dissemble on the subject of our inner life, because it is in  such a fluid state. When we talk about it (now all too common in public), we do so as though it had set fast, even for a moment, in some way. But what are my real purposes? I am talking to a man who has seen things I can only imagine. Yet he avoids shows of emotion and personal feeling because he believes they are destructive. Also, if I were to try to explain to him the nature of my personal circumstances, he would be embarrassed. He hasn't bought the widely held idea that a good airing is beneficial for the inner life. There seems, anyway, to be a metaphorical confusion in this idea: if the inner life is in need of air, how come it takes place in the least accessible parts of our being? In my piece about Drancy, I had written, ‘There are clues here to the nature of humanness.’ They may be clues, but the mystery is as insoluble as ever. Why do I need all this detail? Am I expecting to be able to know all there is to know about Claude Cohn-Casson? Am I hoping to understand the nature of the Nazi mind? Of course not. Perhaps Victoria is right. I pretend to believe in living in my room, but it's true that I am trying to thrust myself on stage. The last thing Letterman wants from me is an alternative, goy, version of the human dilemma. What he wants is a confection. (He is, furthermore, doing me a favour:. I have no track record in scriptwriting.) He has seen a certain facility in my work for grading and assembling the facts. He probably sees me as having mechanical skills, like a dentist's, which higher types must occasionally employ. I am not so green that I expect to get the sole credit on this movie. I don't really believe it will ever be made; I am just providing the raw material which Letterman and some highly paid specialist screenwriter are going to work up into a proper script. Letterman has already sent many messages. His suggestions, his imperatives, have kept Mr Shah's fax humming. I tell Fairfax a great deal more than I had intended, but I believe our confidences are drawing us together. I certainly hope so. He listens, and sometimes he inclines his head  sympathetically, as if to get a better purchase on what I am saying. I wonder, however, if he wants any more personal details at his age. There must come a point when you realize that all these confidences are piling up, useless, in the store room, like the possessions elderly people sometimes keep for no purpose. Eventually we retire. Retire is the right term for what he does: it is a ritual demanding a nightcap, a pee on the edge of the firelight, another nightcap, the preparation of a vacuum flask of hot tea for the bedside and a laborious change into old-fashioned pyjamas. I have offered to sleep in the back of the Toyota. I hear his couchée going on for some time. The tent eventually fails into a deep stillness. I don't sleep immediately. I see the editing together of these elements repeated with new possibilities. Where do you close off the possibilities when you write a script? For example, does the lion hunt become symbolic, bigger than the actual facts warrant? Do I try to see it from the laibon's point of view? How much should Fairfax be seen to know of Claudia's love affair with the laibon's brother, Tepilit? And should I ask Fairfax's permission? Ail these questions — and there are many more — also suggest to me another bigger question, the one that Victoria had noted, the extent of my own involvement. As I lie uneasily in the cab, I wonder why it is that I feel propelled to barge in here. What she is saying is that there are hundreds of millions of people out there who can let life go by without trying to relate themselves to the big issues. She thinks the big issues are grist to self-appointed mills. It's a devilish perpetual motion contraption. Yet I see the mundane matter of the script quite clearly. I see the obvious physical limitations, one hundred minutes, no room for interior monologue, unequivocal scenes of love, grandeur and horror. (Ail of which are well represented in the story as I am learning it.) What I can't do, however, is close off the script until I know the facts. In mitigation I could appeal to Proust: ‘Beneath the signs there lay something of a different kind, which I must try to  discover…’ Sadly, there is a lot about proust's mission which I will never be able to believe in. My feelings are similar in this regard to what Claudia felt about her father's pretensions. And yet Victoria has accused me of exactly the same sin as I am so lightly attributing elsewhere (incidentally, to people who are more fiction than fact). For all I know, Léon Cohn-Casson might have had substantial reasons for believing in his invulnerability. In the way these things happen, the oppressed are sometimes revealed to have a hold on the oppressors. The survivors are the ones on whom suspicion falls. This is commonly reported by the cursed survivors of Auschwitz. I lie in the metal box hoping to hear the elephant passing or the lions roaring, but I only hear a distant hyena against the myriad squeaks and screeches of the night. These noises make a tapestry, each one an individual stitch. I owe it to Victoria to lend some retrospective weight to our parting. Yet I can only picture her in the posture of Candice Riberon in Le Métro lying on her back, her face caught in an agony of uncertain provenance. Sadly it's not an erotic picture. It's more like a Munch. Recalled sexual longings would at least make me feel we had not wasted our store of human essence needlessly. I feel as if I haven't got that much to spare. Also, I wish to recall Victoria as an entire person. But it doesn't work. I see the rictus and an entirely gratuitous glowing flush on her throat. I remember her claim — which I found exciting — that semen contains Vitamin E and is therefore good for the skin. Not to be taken internally. For external application only . But it doesn't summon the erotic circumstance. Gone, gone, gone. I climb out of the Toyota and go to the fire and push the kettle deep into the ash which now mutes the heat. Underneath, the embers are still vivid. I wonder if more people in the world are still heating their water in this way than on some sort of stove. At first I think that the answer must be no. But then I reconsider: what about China? I can't decide. I place a teabag and some powdered milk into the enamel  cup and then pour on the water and stir with a twig. There is a lot of satisfaction in these simple actions. I like the tea with its powdered milk. Excessively milky in the way that artificial banana or strawberry can be excessive in flavour. I drink deeply. Along with the phoney milkiness is the ever-present taste of wood-ash. The laibon is trying to tell us something. Who knows what he has been dreaming? His famous ancestor, Mbatian, made a prophecy about what would happen after the arrival of the white man. He got his information from God via a dream. You don't need a line to God now to see the way things are going. He has seen that the Masai stories and dreams are not going to be much use in the years to come. I wish I could tell him that we are all in the same boat. I finish my tea and climb back into the Toyota. The laibon's fingers are like rolled-up tobacco leaves, crudely made cabbage cigars. They are dry. You feel that the skin would crackle if they rubbed together. His hands are always holding the cylinder which contains his stones. He has read what the care-worn pebbles say, and he doesn't like it. I dream about the Masai. Specifically I dream about the old man's parchment hands with their cheroot fingers, endlessly rolling the container in his hand, this movement polishing and burnishing it, an insistent but unexplained movement of the sort that happens in dreams."
FIC FIC-FAJ-022 -1.32 "THIRTY-THREE The grassland waves and undulates in the morning light. It looks like wheat, except that right in the middle of this prairie is a group of small hills rising unexpectedly out of the flat plain. The hills have clumps of rocks precariously balanced on them. The rocks themselves are streaked with gleaming mineral secretions; in the cracks between them grow spiky aloes with bright red florets. Now a line of Masai warriors appears, walking fast. They are in elaborate head-dresses and carry shields and spears. They approach the first rocky hill and pause. The colour of their cloaks is exactly the colour of the aloe flowers, which stipple the rocks like blobs of oil paint. Some way behind the warriors comes a small caravan of safari vehicles, two open-topped Willys cars and a truck. They pause, too, about a hundred yards from where the Masai are fanning out around one of the hills. In the first vehicle are Waindell Leavitt and Claudia Cohn-Casson. Leavitt has binoculars. He looks ahead to see what the Masai have found. In the second vehicle are the cameraman, his assistant, and the camera equipment. In the truck are servants and armed guards accompanying the safari goods. Tepilit signals to the driver of the first safari car to stay where he is. His arms rise and his hands spread out, pushing them back like someone miming the action of pushing against a wall. He walks fast over to the car and talks to Claudia in Maa. He is lightly beaded with sweat. The lions are here.’ Claudia tells Leavitt. ‘Okay, get the equipment out.’ The Willys behind them is signalled to move up. The crew begin to rig the camera equipment on a platform. This  requires ropes and stays. Leavitt is stout and impatient in his khakis. Under his bush hat he has a thin moustache. ‘Let's get moving.’ Tepilit is anxious. He speaks quietly to Claudia: ‘These men from the other side are not brave. They are afraid to kill the lion.’ ‘Be careful.’ ‘A moran must be brave.’ Claudia touches his hand. Tepilit goes to talk to the warriors. There is evidently disagreement among them. Tepilit and his brother can be seen arguing with the others. In the tangle of rocks and trees we get a glimpse of the lions, now becoming agitated. The cameraman is taking light readings and setting his lenses. The camera is bulky, mounted on a wooden tripod. He wants to get closer. They move the car towards the hill. The askaris have their.303 rifles ready. Tepilit comes running back and speaks to Claudia. She translates for Leavitt. ‘He says that the lions will not stay any longer. They will either run or attack if they are surrounded.’ ‘Just tell them to wait. Just a few minutes. Come on, load the fucking camera.‘ The camera assistant drops a cumbersome magazine. ‘You dumb-ass motherfucker.’ From the hill, which is now completely surrounded by Masai, we hear some growling. The Masai have their spears ready and their shields held high. ‘Hold them, for Chrissakes. And tell them we want the action this side of the hill.’ Claudia tries to explain to Tepilit. He gestures to her to get back. He says something. ‘They can't wait. The lions are going to attack.’ ‘Are you ready yet?’ ‘Almost ready, sir.’ The three vehicles are drawn up in a semi-circle. In front of them is the kopje, surrounded by Masai. The snarling and  growling is very audible as the lions move about, looking for a way out. The camera assistant is having trouble getting the magazine on to the camera. At this moment a lion bursts out of the long grass and bush and leaps on a warrior. Tepilit throws his spear which strikes the lion just behind its shoulder. The lion mauls the warrior, who is desperately trying to fend him off with his knees and shield. Tepilit runs up to the lion, draws his long knife from its sheath and sticks it into the lion's throat. The lion immediately jumps on him and forces him to the ground. At this moment another lion bursts out of the bush and attacks a second warrior. Some of the warriors run. Others hurl their spears blindly. At least six lions and lionesses make their escape, but a third black-maned lion stands menacingly ready to attack. One of the spears strikes a warrior in the chest. Claudia shouts at Leavitt: ‘Shoot, shoot. They are being killed.’ ‘Turn over. Is the camera running? Roll the camera.’ Claudia is horrified. We see her face, paralysed for a moment. Tepilit has pulled his sword out of the lion's neck and plunges it under its throat again. The lion leaves him and staggers away before falling. Tepilit's head is covered in blood and his shoulders and arms are ripped open. Claudia runs to the askaris and tries to seize a gun. ‘Run that camera. On your right. Get that.’ The first Masai is dead. Tepilit, however, rises to his feet. Claudia seizes the askari's gun and fires at the waiting lion. It turns and disappears. The Masai, wounded by a spear, is lying on the ground too. ‘Get out of the fucking way. Keep turning. Claudia, get in the car.‘ The black-maned lion now charges out of the bush in the direction of the cars. The askaris open fire and it drops. Now the Masai are gathering, arguing and shouting. A fight breaks out and one man is struck on the head by a stick. Tepilit, streaming blood, goes over to them. He speaks to them and they separate into two groups, trembling. One man is foaming at the mouth and moaning. Claudia runs over to Tepilit. ‘Get out of the way. They are going to go at it again. Keep turning.’ ‘Salaud. Salaud. Salaud.’ Claudia is hysterical. The askaris are now gathered around the vehicles, perhaps fearing that the Masai will attack them. ‘Get out of the way, for Chrissakes.’ Claudia is weeping. The Masai, who are still highly agitated, back away from each other. One warrior is having a fit. We now see a view of the battlefield: two lions dead, two Masai dead and Tepilit, although standing, severely mauled. ‘Okay. Cut. Cut. Fantastic.’ Claudia and the askaris move Tepilit to the shade. Claudia goes to get the first aid kit. Leavitt intercepts her. ‘I'm real sorry I shouted at you. We got a bit excited there for a minute.’ ‘You are a murderer. You don't care about these people.’ ‘I make movies, sweetheart. That's my job.’ ‘Movies. You don't make movies. You are making a mockery. Look at them. Two men dead and another badly ‘I thought they knew their business. Jesus, I have never seen such a shambles. Let me tell you, these guys don't have our feelings about death or pain. Life is cheap. That's how they live.’ ‘You think that? You think going out and killing oneself for a few shillings is normal to a Masai? You are crazy.’ Leavitt walks with Claudia back to where Tepilit is lying. Tepilit looks up and sees Leavitt. Claudia starts to clean his wounds with mercurochrome, but Tepilit stops her. He speaks with difficulty. ‘What is he saying?’ ‘He says you should leave Masailand now. He says you have caused a lot of trouble.’ ‘Shit. You tell your lover boy next time he goes lion hunting he should get himself just a little better organized. You tell him that. Dumb fuck.’"
NWS NWS-AHC-004 -0.12 "Odd Man Out: The man who carries the can By MARTYN HARRIS AT 1.15 I call the AA to ask can I borrow a patrolman for the afternoon, and at 1.45 he's at the door with sewn-in trouser creases and a shiny van, packed tight as an egg with tools and spares. ‘Mark Roke,’ he says, offering a clean hand. The man who can. The speed may be just because I'm press, of course— Which? magazine said this week the AA is slowest of the big motoring organisations to answer a call. ‘But we always try to get the car going,’ says Mark. ‘A lot of them that works on commission just say there's nothing they can do and call in the tow-truck.’ Not that he will name any names. He's a very nice man. On our first call, from a dreadlocked Rastaman, we are faced with a clapped-out Mini Clubman. Mark says that if it's a fuel leak I can chuck down a lighted match, but I can tell he's only joking. Lots of people with old bangers use the AA instead of basic maintenance, and this is the Rastaman's second call-out of the day for a flat battery. Mark props the rusted bonnet of the Mini with an iron bar, jump-starts it with a pair of wrist-thick wires, and we are away. ‘He won't get far, so if he turns left at these lights we go right,’ says Mark, but it's only his sense of humour showing. As the dash-mounted computer pecks out our next job on its paper roll, Mark runs through his daily routine for me. Commonest call-outs are flat batteries first thing in the morning, flat tyres any time, and at weekends the woman shopper with her keys locked in the car. Effecting an entry, this is called, and a job for Slim Jim, the flexible steel ruler owned by every mechanic and car thief, which, shoved down the side of the driver's door glass, will open anything from a Jeep to a Jaguar. JOB two is a Fiat Panda in Finchley, losing power on hills according to the owner. ‘Frayed clutch cable most likely,’ says Mark before we pull up and I'm profoundly impressed when we find it is. Job three is a scatty old lady with an NS on the computer roll, meaning non-start, and an automatic garage door. ‘Careful you press the right button,’ says Mark. ‘I rang what I thought was the doorbell once and nearly cut this geezer's Mercedes in half with his up-and-over.’ The scatty lady has left her passenger door fractionally open all night and the courtesy light has drained the battery, which takes Mark about two seconds to figure. ‘Always pays to think simple.’ For a soft-shoulder Sunday mechanic like me it would have taken all day, but most of the jobs are incredibly simple to the man who can, who served his time with Ford and spent years at London Transport. People like me are a menace to the AA men, calling them out on Sunday afternoon to rebuild engines that we idly began to dismantle on Sunday morning. ‘Either they hands you a boxful of bits and says ‘These seem to be left over’ or they swear they never touched the car, when you can see all the leads are on back-to-front.’ MEMBERS! They call you out to snowswept motorway verges at four in the morning, talk to you through a quarter-inch crack in the window and drive off when you've finished, without a word. Single women get priority from the AA, so many's the girl will hide her boyfriend behind the hedge to get a faster call-out. Get stuck into an engine without confiscating the car keys, and plenty of drivers will start the motor out of curiosity to see what an AA man looks like without any hands. When you apply to become an AA man they give you six broken cars to get started in half-an-hour. Five minutes per car, but Mark hardly takes more than 15 seconds over our jobs, and nobody waits more than 30 minutes. The only technical challenge of the day is at the home of a lawyer, whose Peugeot 405 has conked out at the bottom of a steep drive. Mark eliminates starter motor, battery, alternator, and ignition coil, and fixes in the end on an obscure switch which isolates the electrics from the gearbox and would have taken me a month to find — but, for the man who can, about three minutes. Last job is an ancient Granada with a jammed starter, driven by another man who has already called the AA once today. Mark frees the starter with a swift smack from the iron bar, which is the only tool I see him use all day, and gently ticks off the driver, who seems lacking in gratitude or humility. ‘You will go and get another motor this time now, won't you?’ And then, as he drives away: ‘We'll see him again soon, don't worry.’ Members!"
NWS NWS-AHD-010 -0.29 "In The Country: The boys from the black stuff Sara Jackson sees how charcoal burners are surviving as a symbol of traditional methods of woodland conservation By SARA JACKSON IN A WOOD in South Ockendon, Essex, on the very outskirts of London, two brothers spend their days cutting dead timber, loading it into a steel kiln and setting it alight. The brothers, Ray and Alan Mitchell, are charcoal burners. Theirs was once a common line of business, but now there are only about two dozen professional burners left in the country. Ray and Alan, who took it up only two years ago, use a method practised for 150 years. As ex-plumbers they are unlikely candidates for resurrecting ancient woodland traditions, yet they are part of a growing drive to do just that. The Mitchells set up Eden Woodland Products in 1990, after the builder they were contracted to went bust in the 1988 crash. They wanted a new start and found one in the form of nearby Hangman's Wood, owned by the Marley Paving company. ‘After the storm of 1987 it was just devastated,’ says Alan. ‘We thought: there's got to be something we can do with all that wood.’ Now they produce barbecue charcoal from it. It's a growing market. In 1987 Britain imported 20,000 tons, and by 1990, 90,000 tons. Hangman's Wood suffered so severely from the gales because, like much of our woodlands, it had been neglected for decades. Yet until the 1950s most had been managed as coppice since Norman times. It provided grazing land, timber, fruits and fuel, while remaining an undamaged wildlife habitat. Coppice management involves dividing a woodland into compartments, or coupes, which are cut on a rotation of five to 25 years. The small ‘underwood’ trees (or coppice) are chopped back to stumps, producing shoots cut for sticks and brushwood. A portion of ‘standards’, such as oaks, are cut for timber at the same time, but saplings are left to replace them. Grazing should be prohibited in the newly-cut coupe for about seven years to allow the establishment of new seedlings. The wood therefore is constantly regenerated, yet also yields a steady supply of timber and grazing. The Mitchells were granted permission to burn charcoal from coppiced timber at Hangman's Wood if they returned it to this state of management. They have cleared their first coupe and, aided by the Woodland Grant Scheme, will replant next spring, replacing weed species — such as sycamore — with oak, cherry and ash. ‘Last spring, bluebells grew in this cleared area for the first time in years,’ Alan said. ‘They couldn't get through the undergrowth before.’ The Mitchells coppice their woodland to earn a living. But other organisations supporting traditional woodland management have more far-reaching objectives in mind. The idea is a simple one; begin working our dwindling woodland again and we could be providing the best argument for preserving it. These organisations include the Woodland Trust, and Thames Chase: the Community Forest in whose area Hangman's Wood lies. Community Forests, funded by the Forestry and Countryside Commissions, were set up in 1990 on the outskirts of major cities. They encourage landowners and businesses to plant on their own land. But the woodland they create will be managed as it was in the past. The principle behind this effort to resurrect the countryside is ecnomic viability. Landowners are more likely to plant and maintain woodland if it provides income. So far, local companies have been the most responsive. Rhone Poulenc at Dagenham is financing the planting of 2,000 trees at nearby Eastbrook School. Two thousand trees on a two-acre site is a lot — too many to survive as fully mature trees — but this excessive planting keeps the programme economically viable. After 20 years or so thinning can begin; the excess trees are used as timber and the remainder form a naturally spaced woodland. But it is the farmers who are the hardest to interest (although all planting is grant-aided). For companies the benefits of co-operation are clear. It is good public relations. ‘The mineral companies especially will find future planning permission easier if they put the land back to good use,’ says Max Hislop, a community forester. Hislop believes that, as crop subsidies fall, farmers will see woodland creation as a practical alternative. Meanwhile, recession hasn't helped the programme. ‘We'd have so much more planted,’ says Hislop. ‘But when companies are laying off workers, they can't then be seen to donate money to charity. It's very difficult.’ It's very difficult too for Ray and Alan Mitchell. The UK imports 95 per cent of its charcoal, mostly from rainforests. Charcoal consumption from these sources is not environmentally acceptable. But the price is. To produce their charcoal, Ray and Alan cut the wood, load the kiln, empty it into sacks after the burn and then re-bag it for retail sale. They also drive around trying to market it. Last year their turnover was £6,000. None of this was profit. They subsidise their income by doing odd jobs for Marley Paving. ‘We can't compete on price with Third World countries,’ says Ray, ‘because it's so labour-intensive. Wholesalers buy imported charcoal at around £1.80 a bag, add 130 per cent and sell it on. We sell these bags at £2.49 and have added only 15 per cent profit.’ But the brothers have faith in the product's future. They believe it will sell because, if consumers are boycotting tropical hardwoods stocked by DIY stores, there is no reason why they should condone burning them on the barbecue. As a sign of their optimism they have begun producing artist's charcoal from willow. The concept behind planting and working woodland deserves to survive current hardships. After all, if the Normans hadn't thought long-term and picked up their trowels 1,000 years ago, there would be no New Forest today. It is ironic that it has taken until the dawn of the 21st century to realise that the best methods of utilising — and hence preserving — our woodlands are those employed a millennium ago."
NWS NWS-AL5-003 -0.1 "‘The NHS is not for sale’ Virginia Bottomley talks to George Jones in her first interview since joining the Cabinet By GEORGE JONES THE NEW Health Secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, set herself an ambitious target yesterday — to ‘take the politics’ out of the National Health Service. But her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the NHS is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform, with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-1990s. Labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the NHS, asking voters for a mandate to reverse the changes. Mrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms — and to give doctors, nurses and managers the confidence to make them work. In her first full interview since being appointed Health Secretary, she said the election result, and Mr Major's unequivocal commitment to the NHS, had finally ‘nailed the lie’ about privatisation of health care. ‘The NHS is not for profit. It is not for sale. It will continue to be true to its founding principles, available to all and free at the point of delivery,’ she said. She recalled a promise made by Mr Major when he became Prime Minister: that he would work for a nation at ease with itself. ‘I want to see a health service at ease with itself — optimistic and confident about its essential work. Health is something which touches every individual and family in the country,’ she said. ‘But there must be changes. An organisation that doesn't change fossilises. Health needs to develop and alter.’ By next year, she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within the NHS. She pledged that the Government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status, but she expected this to be a minority. The Government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to ‘buy’ services for patients, and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding. The election result has given the Conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changes. Most people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment — the issue behind the ‘Jennifer's ear’ controversy during the election campaign. Mrs Bottomley stressed her commitment to the Patient's Charter, which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for NHS operations. The next step is to ensure that, from March, no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation. A national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting times. Mrs Bottomley's first big test as Health Secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round, which will be conducted against a background of concern over high Government borrowing and pressure from the Tory Right for public spending cuts. The Conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase, year by year, the level of ‘real resources’ committed to the NHS — though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated. Mrs Bottomley, representing ‘caring Conservatism’, will face Mr Michael Portillo, the new Treasury Chief Secretary, who is equally keen to establish his Right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings. She acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead. ‘It will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always, inevitably, be more than we can do.’ But she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiency. As well as fighting for more money, her task was to ensure that ‘every last pound’ was spent as effectively as it could be. Her priorities include giving more encouragement to medical research; emphasis on preventive health to make the NHS a ‘health as well as a sickness service’, with the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancers; and pressing ahead with care in the community. As a former psychiatric social worker, Mrs Bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people. ‘It is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settings. That is a real challenge,’ she said. Mrs Bottomley's rise to the top has been swift, with only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the Cabinet table. But she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women — Mrs Gillian Shephard at the Department of Employment and herself — has excluded more able men from the Cabinet. ‘Prime Ministers always have to consider balance in the Cabinet — and at least we now have the same number of women as old Etonians in John Major's team,’ she said."
NWS NWS-BM4-030 -0.16 "Village school prepare for a new history lesson BENTLEY Primary School are celebrating their 150th anniversary this year and preparations are well under way for a week under way for a week of special events in May. Highlights will be an exhibition of photographs and artefacts depicting village life, a Victorian Day in school when everyone will be in costume, a drama production and a Victorian fete. The exhibition will not only show life in Bentley during the past 150 years, but also that of Froyle, concentrating on the development of both village schools, culminating in their merger in 1986. Head teacher of Bentley School, Philip Callaway, told the Herald that during the week, the children's topic work would also be looking at changes in everyday life over the 150 years. ‘Hopefully we will be able to make history come alive for the children,’ Mr. Callaway said, adding that the school would still be grateful for as many old photographs and bits and pieces of memorabilia as possible. ‘We would also like former pupils of the school, both locally and from more distant parts, to visit us during the celebrations, he said. Bentley School was built 150 years ago on half an acre of land given by Bishop Sumner of Winchester but its history prior to 1882 is almost non-existent since the log books for the early years have long since been lost. But from the log books of 100 years ago, there is a very vivid picture of school life in Bentley. Main industry Hop growing was the main industry in the village and the school's calendar was very much influenced by the farming calendar: ‘August 24th, 1883 — broke up for the harvest and hop tying today. Very few children have been present during this week, many with their parents in the field. We should have broken up before but there is every prospect of a late and long hopping in which case we should have difficulty in making the necessary attendances.’ The building itself, today so warm and modern, left a lot to be desired: ‘March 3rd, 1890 — Temperature at school at 9.30 a.m. is 32F… December 23rd, 1891 — It has been impossible to do much work this week, for the room has been so cold, we have been obliged to drill to keep ourselves warm. It was no better in the summer: ‘July 10th, 1885 — The hot weather makes the work very difficult. As the ditches smell so badly we are obliged to keep the north windows shut…‘ In 1892, the school managers’ book reveals that the infant classroom was enlarged and in 1893 the ‘excellent master's house’was built by public subscription at a total cost of £613.7.3d. Then, in 1914, major renovation of the building was undertaken to give a new large room, some 5ft. wider and 7ft. higher, as well as a new infants' classroom and cloakrooms. During these alterations the school moved into a nearby hop kiln, to the great delight of the children. Walter Sherfield, who had started school the year before, remembers the time well, particularly during the long hot summer days when lessons were held out in the open, under the old oak trees. He remembers that work on the new school building had to be completed by the end of August since the hop kilns were needed in September. With the coming of the first world war, the children of Bentley School were soon busy with their own war efforts — they had a collection for the Blue Cross Fund for horses and a War Loan Savings Association was formed. A war school garden was started in 1917 with some 20 boys planting potatoes…in October the records show that ‘Each of the 20 boys received about 56 lbs. of potatoes.’ Acorns and horse chestnuts were collected to be used in the making of munitions and several old pupils, on leave from the front, visited the school. In 1918 it's disclosed that: ‘The managers have arranged to supply those children, who remain, to dinner with a hot meal for a penny halfpenny per day per child.’ Each day, the meal was made up of baked potatoes and either rice pudding, soup, hashed beans and vegetables or oatmeal porridge. Forefathers Around the time of the renovations, there was some discussion on handing the school over to the state, but the management committee, headed by the rector, the Rev. Henry Moody, concluded: ‘The time has not yet come…for the surrender of these schools and the forfeiting thereby of the gifts and labours of our forefathers.’ Indeed, it wasn't until 1958 that the committee's successors decided that the increase in pupils needed better amenities than the dwindling funds could provide. State aid was accepted for the school, although the Church still retained some control. In recent years, the school has seen major changes with the enlargement and modernisation of the building to accommodate the extra children from nearby Froyle, following the closure of the school there in 1986. An entry in the school log book after the earlier renovation in 1914 might have been written today. It states: ‘I received a letter from the chief inspector, Mr. Wynne Williams, today saying that he wishes to congratulate the managers on the new buildings, ‘among the best in the county’. He adds: ‘Educationally, the school seems to have a future’…‘. If you can help the school with photos or exhibits or would like to get involved in some way, ‘phone 0420 23273.

NWS NWS-BM4-035 -0.15 "News from Alresford Does the town want a new cemetery? COUNCIL ASKS FOR RESIDENTS' VIEWS THE limited powers of the parish council, which are in turn further limited by lack of resources cause much frustration, said chairman Roy Downham at Alresford Parish Council's annual meeting held in the Phair Hall of the Community Centre on Friday evening. There is always, he said, more than needs doing, than can be afforded. Mr. Downham asked the public their views on two subjects currently under discussion. One is the need for a burial ground, as the town cemetery, in St. John's churchyard, is very nearly full, and there is no possibility of any extension. A new ground will be costly and a suitable area will need to be found. He asked if residents wanted a new cemetery in Alresford, rather than use the Winchester cemetery. Water fears The second subject was that two dry winters are inevitably leading towards a summer of water shortages. The council are considering asking the Southern Water Authority to impose restrictions on use of water now rather than wait until matters become really serious. Mr. Downham also presented the financial account, saying that it had been decided not to increase the parish council's share from the community charge, by more than five percent. Reporting for the recreation grounds committee, Barbara Griffiths said that £25,688 had been spent on recreation in Alresford in the past year. The major project, costing £20,698, had been the refurbishment of the play area at the Stratton Bates recreation ground, including new equipment and a safety surface. It has been agreed that the changing rooms at the Stratton Bates playing field needs to be replaced and £10,000 has already be set aside in the current budget towards the cost, which is anticipated to be in the region of £55,000. The Sun Hill recreation ground is in need of similar treatment to that of Stratton Bates. A grant has been requested towards the cost of installing a safety surface and a number of residents have volunteered to form a family fund-raising group to help with providing equipment. This has been welcomed by the council. New lights The shelter and the shed at the War Memorial gardens have been vandalised. The tennis courts at Arlebury Park are to be resurfaced shortly, and the football pitches at both Arlebury and Stratton Bates continue to be well used and are an ongoing maintenance expense. Bill Liddiard, chairman of the lighting committee, referred to new lighting in Station Road, additional lighting in The Avenue, and the proposed changes to lighting in Broad Street. The lights in Broad Street are both corroded and obsolete. Lighting columns now have to be to regulation safety standards, and it is hoped that the new lights chosen will be complementary to the street. Two sample lights have been installed, and plans showing the changes are on view in Eddolls shop window in Broad Street. Members of the public expressed some dismay that the new lighting would be yellow, pointing out that the white light gives a character and atmosphere to this conservation area which should not be altered. Chris Webb reported a quiet year for the planning committee, with only 78 applications, most of them for extensions, alterations and change of use, although it had included plans for low cost housing. A new amenities committee had been formed within the parish council during the year, and chairman Ken Yeldham explained that it had been formed to deal with the things that fell outside the scope of the present committees. Six committees of the new committee had taken place, with a watchful eye being kept on environmental improvements, the need for bus shelters, involvement in finding a place for the youth of the town to meet, and consideration of the difficulties faced by the very elderly and disabled in the town centre. The committee had also carried out a survey of parking problems in residential areas. Currently they are seeking suitable permanent parking places for the local St. John Ambulance vehicles, and organising an official Spring Clean Day on April 4th. Hampshire county councillor Peter Maxwell was at the meeting and he said that the community charge had been set at £237, which is £33 below the government guideline. Winchester city councillor Major Dougie Covill requested that more pressure be put upon the county council to improve the footpaths and pavements which are in a very dangerous condition, and a Broad Street businessman wondered if residents were really aware of the changes going on in Broad Street, and the manner in which they were to be undertaken. The meeting ended with a talk with slides presented by Rod Murchie of the National Rivers Authority. Broad Street changes on show OUTLINES to the proposed changes in Alresford's Broad Street are on display in Eddoll's shop window in the street until the end of March. The scheme was brought about by the need to replace dying trees and a desire for a comprehensive improvement scheme. Princes Street limes have been especially selected as replacement trees, paid for by the town trustees. The first phase will begin at the Horse and Groom end of the street in the coming financial year and later works will proceed when finance and opportunities permit. Key aspects of the scheme will be widening and repaving footways, replanting trees, retaining car parking and private accesses and improving lighting. The town trustees say they would welcome any comments on the scheme. Manuscript evening reveals ‘things not generally known’ FROM memories of a journey through Alresford in the 1920s to a paper on Rasputin, the stories told by members at Alresford Historical and Literary Society's annual manuscript evening held the large audience's attention with their detail and variety. Reg Sanders' ‘Things not generally known’ opened the evening with a mish-mash of information gleaned through some 300 historical reference books. For instance, he said that the expression ‘by hook or by crook’ came from the period of Charles II when there were two judges called Hook and Crook and ‘a man of straw’he discovered, was one who could be brought to bear false witness — recognisable by the straw in his shoes. Ursula Oxley read from the memoirs of Henry Hunt who was born Wiltshire, was elected to parliament, and worked for the repeal of the corn laws. On February 15th, 1835, en route to the west country he stopped at Alresford, was seized by paralysis and died. His mistress, Mrs. Vince, wanted his body to be placed in her family vault, but the family objected, and the corpse was eventually removed to Parham. Some years later, another Henry Hunt, Alresford's famous architect, was born but there is no connection between the two. Mrs. Oxley concluded her reading with three poignant poems about her son that she wrote herself. The Russian monk Rasputin, who was influential in Tsar Nicholas II's court, was the subject of Cyril Flack's manuscript. Mr. Flack's own interest began in 1934 when he was in court for the libel case brought against the MGM film company who had made a film about Rasputin. The case became the standard for setting the difference between libel and slander. Early memories of Northern Rhodesia were the inspiration for Robin Grieves-Cook's manuscript. He remembered small birds cleaning teeth of 14ft. crocodiles and a close encounter when he accompanied a hunter and ‘bagged’ six crocodiles. Motorcycle ride One of the highlights of the evening was Roy Robins' beautifully written ‘A journey through Alresford’. This recalled a journey from his home in Farnham to Dorset by motorcycle and sidecar in the 1920s. His lively description had the audience sharing the thoughts of the small boy as he travelled through Alresford, Romsey, Wimborne and Blandford, and almost feeling his stiff limbs and sore bottom. Elsie Sanders concluded the evening with a visit to West Meon cemetery, to the grave of Tom Lord, cricketer and founder of Lord's Cricket Ground. He retired to Hampshire and died in 1832 at the age of 76. The MCC continue to care for his grave. In contrast, on the other side of the same cemetery is the grave of the Burgess family, where the ashes of the spy Guy Burgess, who died in Russia, were placed. Appropriately, this manuscript was called ‘The Famous and Infamous’. CHERITON CUBS GO FORWARD BEAVERS and cub scouts of the Alresford scout district held their annual football rallies in the grounds of Sun Hill Junior School. Beavers from Alresford, Medstead, Ropley and Four Marks took part in the morning rally. Every beaver played in the six-a-side on two pitches, each one receiving the certificate for good teamwork. Referees were Tim Giles — who organised the event — and Mark Appleton. The cub rally followed with eight teams, two Medstead, two from Four Marks and one each from Alresford, Cheriton, Ropley and the Candover Valley cub packs. In the semi-finals Cheriton beat Candover Valley and Alresford won their game with Ropley. A well fought final resulted in Cheriton beating Alresford 1–0. The team from Cheriton will now go forward to the county finals on April 5th. Referees were district commissioner David Harvey, Alan Pritchard and Bob Rodwell. Live frogs at the club LOCAL GP Dr. Michael Clark was the guest of the Alresford Afternoon Social Club recently. He talked about frogs, with a few live examples, plus some tadpoles. After the talk he was invited to select the best dressed carrot in the club's competition for the month. This was won by Ruby Lansley who had turned hers into a caterpillar. Meditation for Lent ALRESFORD Mothers' Union members were welcomed to their March meeting by Pat Ruffle, deputising for chairman Barbara Jones. The Rt. Rev. Leslie Lloyd Rees led a meditation for Lent, which opened with a hymn and went on to consider the ministry of Christ's passion and resurrection. PLAYING SAFE JAMES Linington, aged seven, Peter Rogers, aged six, and his brother, Alex, aged four, were having fun on the side at the refurbished play area at the Stratton Bates recreation ground in Grange Road, Alresford when it was opened officially by chairman of the parish council, Roy Downham, on Saturday morning. Accompanied by Winchester city councillor Major Dougie Covill, Mr. Downham and Barbara Griffiths of the council's recreation committee, watched children enjoying the colourful new equipment with safety surfaces. The cost of this project to the town has been £20,698 and Mr. Downham hoped that it would not only give much enjoyment, but would be treated with respect by all, so that it can be enjoyed for many years. Second time winner MORE than 100 guests took part in Perin's School Association's table quiz evening on Saturday. Questionmaster was Colin Chard, and there was a break for supper. The winners were Hilary and David Carr, Geraldine and Stephen Pinch, Liz and Peter Petherham and Diana and Edward Woolridge who also won the quiz last year."
NWS NWS-CH3-224 -0.19 "My sacking hurt me, my family and my friends like hell PHIL THOMPSON ON THE CRISIS AT LIVERPOOL NEIL SILVER PHIL Thompson last night described the torment of his sacking by Liverpool. In a frank debate on the Anfield crisis on Sky TV Thompson, former Liverpool skipper and coach, told how his shock sacking had shattered his family. ‘It hurt me, it hurt my family and friends like hell,’ said Thompson. ‘And I've not been given a good reason for it.’ Thompson was backed by former hard-man Liverpool colleague Tommy Smith, who said Thompson should have been given a medal for what he did at Anfield, not the sack. Here is the amazing transcript of the debate, on The Footballers' Football Show, which also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrenson, and which was hosted by presenter Richard Keys. Debate We pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisions. BRIAN HALL: ‘At that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cup, he's got the opportunity of reaching Wembley, he's had a difficult time in the League, it's been a traumatic season okay, then he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39. ‘There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solid, rational decisions. I don't think so under those sort of circumstances.’ TOMMY SMITH: ‘So you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five seconds?’ HALL: ‘No, what I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologised, he's made apologies. I think we ought to make some understanding of the sort of pressures that the man was under at the time when all this happened, and it happened very quickly.’ PHIL THOMPSON: ‘So that mean's I get my job back does it?’ RICHARD KEYS: ‘We should explain that too. Phil, you were on the coaching staff and left in the summer. ‘I understand you've got a legal problem which means we can't go too deeply into that, but from the outside is it hurting you a little bit?’ THOMPSON: ‘It hurts like hell. Reasons for my dismissal were nothing like I think I deserved. I think it lies a little bit deeper.’ SMITH: ‘I think the lad deserved a medal, because they won the Cup with half a reserve side out last year — and he was taking care of the reserves.’ THOMPSON: ‘All I've just said is that it was not a good enough explanation of what I got and I don't think anybody has been told, not only to the media out there, myself who is the most important one. ‘But it hurt me, my family and my friends like hell. And I've not had a good enough reason why — that's all I'm hurting Brian, I don't think that is taking anything too far.’ KEYS: ‘Mark, somewhat distanced from it now, what's you're impression of what's happening at Anfield.’ MARK LAWRENSON: ‘I think the thing you have to say Richard, they've only played eight games. This has happened before and no matter what people say I think in my second year we were about 16th or 17th.’ KEYS: ‘But it is not just a question of what is going on on the park, it's what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previously, ever. LAWRENSON: ‘No but I honestly believe that there are certain members of the Press that are delighted to have a go at Liverpool because of the success that they've had. ‘They are a victim of their own success. It has been absolutely phenomenal, it really has, and now all of a sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the stories. ‘How many games are there left? 34? You know, I don't think he (Souness) has been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been there. ‘So I think it is a bit early to pre-empt things.’ Souness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian club. SMITH: ‘Souness seems to be changing an awful lot. If he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then great, but so far it hasn't been that successful. ‘I know that Liverpool won the FA Cup — thanks to Phil and his reserves, because most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuries. ‘There's a big question mark about how Liverpool train. They go on pasta diets now. If food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 years. ‘An awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly club.’ THOMPSON: ‘The thing with Bill Shankly was that we were always a family and everyone knew each other from the cleaning lady to the girls in the ticket office. It was something special.’ PHIL Thompson is still bitter at the way he was treated at Anfield. SMITH: ‘Thompson deserved medal’ LAWRENSON: ‘Too early to judge’ SOUNESS: Upset some Anfield fans"
NWS NWS-K38-001 -0.17 "WE PROMISE FULL CONSULTATION AT ALL TIMES IT HAS been reported that the Flaybrick Chapels in Boundary Road, Bidston, were to be renovated and turned into a ‘Crisis Centre’ for Birkenhead. As vicar of Bidston and deeply involved in the plans, may I correct a few misleading rumours. Firstly, any plans for the chapel complex are only in embryonic form. We have no money whatsoever in the ‘kitty’ and things are at a very early stage of development. It has always been my intention to call a public meeting for all interested parties once we have something definite to report. We would never dream of beginning anything of this kind without gaining the views of local residents. Secondly, I am well aware that the idea of a ‘Crisis Centre’ conjures up all kinds of pictures. Perhaps that is not the best way of describing what our ideas are. What we envisage is somewhere open and staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, where anybody can come for help and advice. Our aim would be to link in with all the caring agencies in the area and provide care and assistance as and when it was needed. Any activity taking place around the refurbished buildings would be carefully controlled and would not be troublesome. The idea would be very much an extension of our activities at St Oswald's Church Centre in Bidston Village. Since this centre has been open vandalism has ceased. Thirdly, our plan is to screen the buildings from the rest of the cemetery and to have the entrance on Boundary Road. Please rest assured that nothing will get beyond the earliest stages of preparation without full consultation taking place. If anyone has any further questions, do not hesitate to contact me at St Oswald's Church Centre (tel:). Ice cream charges have certainly changed since the days of this 1920s ‘Stop me and buy one’ trike Ice cream racket AS SUMMER comes in and the demand for ice cream increases so the opportunities arise for the vendors to overcharge, especially when parents are treating their children. Prices for ices vary considerably and this also applies to quality. Recently, I was charged £1.45 for a ‘cornetto-type’ and a choc ice. As there were a number of Wall's stickers on the van, I thought I was getting ices of their make. The charge at my local sweetshop for genuine Wall's Cornetto and a choc ice is £1.10. Name and address supplied. Strong campaigns I READ the letter headed ‘White elephants’ which concerned the Playhouse, Everyman and William Roberts Centre. I find it amazing that reader Mrs J.  took the time and effort to castigate another community Norris Green for fighting to keep an asset in an area that is one of the most socially and economically deprived in this city. Mrs  states that the people who want these facilities should pay for them. We do. Does she think that we get access to these facilities free of charge? We not only pay an entrance fee to access these facilities, we also pay a community charge for local amenities. The quote ‘These outfits lose money because no one wants them’ does not make sense. If no one wants them, why are there such strong campaigns to keep them? Murder victim Fiona Jones THIS JUSTICE IS A FRENCH FARCE THE ABSURDLY lenient sentence given to Frederic Blancke, the French hospital worker who brutally murdered British school teacher Fiona Jones, is a travesty of justice. After attacking Fiona and leaving her for dead, he later returned and repeatedly slashed her throat, ignoring her pleas for mercy. This monster could be free, to possibly kill again, in less than seven years. Therefore the French judicial system must at least review this erroneous judgement. Fiona's mother says she will never set foot in France again in view of the treatment by the French towards our British fishermen, farmers and truckers. That may not be too bad a criterion for many of us. Please support Fiona Jones's parents by asking your local MP to take up their cause. Echo's June 1st headline WHAT ON earth are the bosses of Wirral Social Services being paid for? I ask this question after reading in the Echo about their latest crazy scheme sending out instructions to all child-minders that they must feed their young charges ‘culture food’. By this they apparently mean curry, etc. Curry is an acquired taste and heavily spiced food is surely not suitable for the stomachs of very young children. These Social Services bosses should leave English people to feed their children in the way they see fit, just as ethnic groups feed their children. If they think forcing strange food down children's throats will enhance good race relations, then they are barking up the wrong tree. It is only by teaching respect for one another that different races can live peacefully together. CAN ANYBODY be expected to take the Deputy Director of Wirral Social Services seriously when he suggests that feeding curry to toddlers will help them counteract the evils of racism? On reading the Echo report I had to look at the top of the page to make certain that the date was June 1st and not April 1st. Princess Diana under fire from reader D.P.  of Bootle Di can't know PRINCESS Diana knows nothing about the lives of ordinary, everyday people and of inner city deprivation and squalor. She cannot even begin to comprehend how a mother feels about bringing up children on state benefits or the frustration and despair of young people who can see no likelihood of ever finding meaningful employment. Nor can she be expected to. Yet here she is on television telling us all how to manage our lives and formulating phrases about how best to overcome adversity. If only those grey establishment figures would stop putting palliatives into her mouth in order to mitigate her credibility under the Crown. I MUST PAY £22.50 MORE A WEEK WHY WAS so much noise and trouble caused over the poll tax? Now that the council tax is implemented, not a dicky bird from Labour, Liberal or the people of any of the big cities. Now tax on electric, gas, and every other fuel and still no shouting. The council tax, increase in rents, and tax on electric and gas now means I must find approximately another £22.50 a week. I wonder if my pension will be increased to meet some of these demands? The council tax is a disgrace. These valuations are way over the top and it is time a lot of these councillors where brought down to earth. No to 40hr week THE CONTROVERSY concerning the EEC directive for a working week of not more than 48 hours is beyond belief. Anyone who knows anything about the building workers and continued process working will understand that there are numerous reasons why it is impossible to have a 40 hour working week. Sickness of workers requires skilled process workers from other shifts to fill the gap. Selected holiday dates also cause an effect. This means a slight rise in the wages account which is no different than working overtime for cleaning and maintenance of machinery. Politicians should think and inquire before they speak trash. Live in harmony WHY CAN'T everybody be in harmony with each other? I am sick of people arguing over their colour because it affects so many children and they have to suffer the consequences."
NWS NWS-K4S-150 -0.25 "MONEY still does not grow on trees. But from this weekend the public gets a chance to see the old phrase turned on its head. Flanking the drive to Middlesbrough's innovative Botanic Centre, to be opened by Professor David Bellamy tomorrow morning, are native trees such as oak, maple and mountain ash. Bursting with spring health, they are drawing sustenance from a compost containing thousands of banknotes and travellers cheques. Discarded and shredded by the Bank of England and banknote manufacturer Thomas De La Rue, the paper money has been mixed at the Botanic Centre with sludge from a KP crisp factory on Teesside to form a peat-free compost. ‘We're confident we've created a good product,’ says centre manager Stuart Goldie. ‘It's ideal as a soil conditioner and for tree planting, and besides being used here it is being used in planting Cleveland's new Community Forest.’ At the centre, visitors can see not only the trees flourishing on literally the world's richest compost. Also on view are the 16 ‘bins’, or bays, where various blends of the novel mixture, which also includes straw and other organic materials, have been prepared. Some newly-planted cabbages also have the cash-based compost at their roots. ‘We're still developing it for use with seedlings and delicate plants,’ says Stuart, ‘but we're certain it has tremendous potential.’ The compost initiative is just one aspect of a project which, perhaps against expectations, puts Middlesbrough in the forefront of ecological awareness. And evangelism. For on its 20-acre edge-of-town site, with neat new houses nudging its entrance just off a busy roundabout, the Botanic Centre is ambitiously committed to spreading the Green gospel. ‘The headlines on environmental issues are invariably about problems and catastrophes,’ says Stuart, a former ICI technical manager. ‘We want the centre to project the positive side. In particular we want to provide inspiration and ideas for the public, showing methods and techniques that they can adopt. Apparently a poacher turned gamekeeper, Stuart sees no conflict in having switched from ICI's fertiliser division to the organic field. ‘The principles of good husbandry apply whether you are dealing with organic or inorganic methods,’ he says. Perhaps more important is that the demonstration role of the centre, which was launched by Prince Charles three years ago, marks it off from most traditional ‘botanic gardens’. For their prime concern is conserving and showing plants. But the Botanic Centre, initiated by Middlesbrough Council, is determined to build bridges with the community. Already about 80 well-wishers, including Middlesbrough FC striker Bernie Slaven, have ‘adopted a tree’ their £10 sapling marked by a plaque. And strong links have been forged with local schools. ‘Pupils have been involved with soil analysis and seed propagation,’ says Stuart. ‘They've collected conkers, ash keys and acorns, to produce seedlings here which they will later transplant in the Community Forest.’ Most imaginatively, one school closely involved with the Botanic Centre, Acklam Grange comprehensive, is now devising a scheme to clean its waste kitchen water, which will feed a pond network. Stuart comments: ‘We hope to extend these contacts by developing a complete education package. We believe the Centre offers tremendous scope for projects and studies within the National Curriculum.’ Opening tomorrow is the centre's shop, tearoom, demonstration garden and exhibition hall. Items on sale will include vegetables and herbs from the centre's own three-acre market garden and bread, jams, and other produce from the well-known Camphill Communities of Botton Hall in the North York Moors and its sister settlement at Larchfield near Middlebrough. In the garden, visitors can see compost systems, natural means of weed and pest control and various cultivation techniques, including a ‘no dig’ system. Head gardener Matthew Hayes, who trained at Emerson College, Sussex, a leading centre for organic horticulture, says: ‘We aim to provide a good insight into sound organic practice , which visitors can adopt in their own garden or allotment.’ Though still in a somewhat raw state, the Botanic Centre is well laid out, with attractive pergola-framed walkways planted with honeysuckle, roses and clematis. A terrace for open-air teas looks towards the award-winning British Tioxide white garden, re-created here after its success at the Gateshead Garden Festival. The demonstration garden itself leads to a so-called 21st century garden, with wildflower meadow, pond, orchard and soft fruit area. ‘The idea is to create a garden that combines minimum maintenance with maximum attraction for wildlife,’ says Stuart. ‘Our wildlife areas are attracting a lot of birds, insects and butterflies.’ Though half the £300,000 spent on the project so far has come from central and local government and charities, the other half has been provided by industry. This is mirrored in the exhibition centre, where, alongside displays on issues like global warming and acid rain, sponsoring firms including ICI and British Steel set out their environmental stall. To some visitors this uncritical PR might strike an uneasy note. But Stuart says: ‘Companies are keen to improve their image and there's a lot of good work going on. It seems fair to provide a shop window.’ The centre hopes that cash generated by visitors will chiefly propel it into the final two phases of its development. Expected to take at least four years to achieve, these will see the creation of a wide range of specialised habitats salt marsh, sand dunes, mountain stream, moorland and wetland all with their associated tree and plant life. And the centre will equip itself to demonstrate the latest developments in wind, water, and solar power. ‘We think it will be unique,’ says Stuart Goldie. — David Bellamy will arrive at the centre off Ladgate Lane (A1044), near the Blue Bell Hotel, Acklam, at 10.30am. The opening events, between 11am and 11.30am, will include a Free Fall display by the Black Lanyards and music by Lingdale Silver Band. Attractions on Sunday and Monday include the Tetley dray horses, a Barley to Beer exhibition and a farming display. — The centre is open at weekends and Bank Holidays, admission £1.20 adults, 40p children, 80p OAPs and unemployed, £2.50 families. No charge for shop or tearoom. Phone Middlesbrough (0642) 594895."
NWS NWS-K5C-023 -0.23 "Taking note of sex and the single student As university teachers suggest a code of conduct, Dea Birkett recalls a personal encounter with a lecherous lecturer AS EVERY student knows, affairs with lecturers are as much a part of university life as examination nerves, drunken parties and late night deliberations on the Romantic poets. But as long as these extra-curricular affairs are conducted discreetly behind closed departmental doors, the academic establishment turns a blind eye. At last the Association of University Teachers (AUT) has brought the subject of staff-student sexual relations out into the open. In a draft policy statement entitled: ‘University Consensual Relationships’ published last week, the AUT recommends lecturers officially report romantic or sexual involvement and cease professional responsibility for the student concerned. The AUT statement is designed to protect students from sexual harassment and lecturers from charges of favouritism. As the statement makes clear: ‘Students who are involved in sexual/romantic relationships with staff and who do not consider their involvement to be truly consensual should have the right of complaint under a sexual harassment policy.’ But in the hierarchical world of academia, drawing a line between consensual and non-consensual sex is far from easy. As the AUT statement recognises: ‘to embark upon a sexual/romantic relationship with a student involves serious difficulties rooted in the unequal power, and hence choice, of the parties concerned.’ My own experiences echo these difficulties. When I was a 22-year-old Edinburgh University student, a tutor made unwelcome sexual advances to me in his office. From my perspective, it was a clear cut case of abuse. But at the same time as my accusation was being assessed by a prestigious board of Edinburgh academics, just a departmental door away a female student and her male lecturer were engaging in clandestine consensual sex. There was nothing forced or unwanted in their relationship; they fancied each other, mentally and physically, and as two reasonable adults indulged their desires. She felt no grounds for grievance, and many years later still has no regrets. Now a lecturer herself, her former lover is a good and supportive friend. Not all academic alliances are as equal. I remember one dashing lecturer who regularly took his pick from each year's fresher intake. All of his young women would have regarded their conduct as consensual. The lecturer may have been 20 years older, wealthier, and inevitably wiser, but that is often why the student chose to sleep with him. Power, even academic power, is very sexy. The AUT's draft policy statement points to this imbalance. But is it the role of trade unions to monitor how equal personal relationships are? Should an office worker's union draw up guidelines requiring bosses to declare publicly if they see their secretaries after hours? Perhaps the relationship between academic staff and student is essentially different so that regulation is required. It is only the medical profession that legislates for sex between doctors and patients. The General Medical Council advises that if a medical practitioner engages in a sexual relationship with his patient this may be considered an abuse of privilege and lead to charges of serious professional misconduct. The AUT's discussion paper points to many qualities — trust, confidence and dependency — shared by academics and doctors. In addition, it argues that in the academic arena, a single affair can affect more than two people: ‘Fellow students and colleagues and the learning and working environment will be affected, especially when conflict of interest and unfairness are involved.’ In the United States, some colleges implement policies which bar staff from engaging in any sexual conduct with a student, however consensual. The AUT has rejected recommending such strict policing of personal relationship. A motion supporting a code of conduct ‘preventing consensual relationships as constituting an abuse of power’ was dropped in favour of a more softly-softly approach. The member of staff must report, but need not terminate, the relationship. The AUT's code is an implicit recognition of the right of university students to bed down with the partner of their choice. Women should not simply be seen as smitten fools in need of protection; when they accept the advances of those professionally above them, they know the murky pond in which they plunge. Yet still many choose for reasons — good or bad but their own — to sleep with their academic teachers. We cannot separate power from sex. But we can distinguish between wanted and unwanted sexual attention, especially important in universities where futures are forged. Staff-student sexual relationships are not role models, but nor are they necessarily deplorable; sexual harassment of a student is. My own case dragged on for months, swamped with innuendos — if another student was having a clandestine consensual affair, why couldn't I have been too? Eventually my case was supported and the tutor asked to resign. By opening those departmental doors, the AUT guidelines provide a powerful weapon against the hidden crime of sexual harassment in the ivory towers."
NWS NWS-K5C-030 -0.14 "The ugly truth about being a glamour puss My thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them WHAT IS happening today? Has someone turned the clock back 100 years and forgotten to tell me? Perhaps I have just become too comfortable with the cheering notion that women are far too busy getting on with their careers and their lives to crucify themselves worrying about ragged cuticles or the size of their ankles. Stupidly, I presumed that the ancient axiom that females were put on this planet for purely decorative purposes or that being pretty (or perhaps a spot of procreation) were the pinnacles of achievement had forever died out alongside the bustle and/or the bubble car. But no. We're still talking about Fiona Armstrong's calves and debating fulsomely about the length of hemlines. And how enervating, how disappointing, how absolutely…crushing to realise that nothing has changed — over the last few decades at least— and that for many women, their primary response is still to be beautiful rather than brainy. And why the hell not? The current status quo demands that others remain more interested in the size of one's bust rather than the size of one's IQ. And — good grief — the news that it is successful and powerful females saying this is enough to make strong women weep into their double gins. Or should that be double chins? This latest bulletin is so depressing, I put on 6lbs just thinking about it. And do you know something? I don't care. Really, Fay Weldon of all people should know better. In a volte-face that makes Germaine Greer's change of heart look like a tiny emotional trifle, the former feminists' champion has switched from the red corner to the blue corner without a blush in the process. The author of The Fat Woman's Joke and The Life and Loves of a She Devil has suddenly decided that being one of Britain's highest paid and smartest novelists who can command fees of £200,000 per book simply isn't enough. ‘I used to think that you should always be yourself but now I like to be made up, smile and look like a woman should,’ preens Fay. she added: ‘Looking good on your book jackets means that more people will read you.’ Oh really? I can't recall Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Jeffrey Archer, Frederick Forsyth and Uncle Tom Cobley and all looking luscious on any of their best-selling titles. There is, of course, nothing wrong with trying to look your best, but for the born-again Weldon to refuse to see anyone unless she spent half the day in the hairdressers and then proclaim that she's only doing it to further her career (oh, please) smacks of hypocrisy of the very highest order. What she is really saying, after all this time, is that it is more important for a woman than a man to look good. Sadly, this makes all her high moral stances and her bonny sights of yesteryear come tumbling down like a house of cards. And weep, once more, for Steffi Graf who was hot off the baseline this week with a whingeing moan about her physique. Graf is one of the world's top tennis players whose supreme athleticism and guts have put her at the top of a very tough profession. Is this enough? Of course not. ‘I am no fan of my muscles,’ she bleated to a German magazine. ‘I hate my size.’ What on earth does she think has powered her to the top of her sport and put millions of deutschmarks into her bank account? Her winning smile or her pretty blonde hair? Not that you're interested, but my thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them. If I had a physique as powerful and beautiful as Graf's, I'd use the strength to knock some sense into her daft head. Who does she want to look like? Vanessa Paradis or Michelle Pfeiffer? Sometimes despair is the only option. And what about Body Shop supremo Anita Roddick, the woman who has been feted for the last ten years as some kind of environmentally conscious feminist icon. I have always been deeply suspicious of Roddick and her cliche-ridden slogans and highly-publicised efforts to save the world, while quietly amassing a fortune on the side. I never bought that stuff about her ever-expanding conscience and I certainly never bought any of her beauty products. Life, for me, is certainly not too short to stuff a mushroom. However, it is at least ten million years too short to spend an evening piddling about with peppermint footbaths or rainforest elixir ear-lobe exfoliators. But wait! Anita the fabled feminist has a complaint she want you all to hear. She thinks it is simply awful that being successful and (reading the ill-camouflaged sub-text) gorgeous means that men won't chat her up, admire her breasts or perceive her as a sexual creature. Anita doesn't want to save the planet any more. She wants to save her self-esteem. She has decided that pretty compliments from members of the opposite sex are what, after all, is important in this life. Anyone viewing all this nonsense from another planet — as most men do — can be forgiven for assuming that women are a bunch of mixed up crazies who don't know what they want, but do know that they want it all, both ways and with jam on the top, too. No-one can deny that being pretty helps — no female on breakfast television would have a career otherwise — but I cannot believe that we are turning back to the dark days when it was deemed the most important thing of all."
