HOC HOC-AZ -1.41 " Having recently become self employed, my company's Christmas party will just be for one this year. I won't let that stop me though. Now, if only I had a photocopier...      Unlike some of you Yanks, we really know how to let our hair down at our office Christmas parties in the UK. Last year we all got really drunk. I had such a hangover the next day!!      I used to get drunk at parties, but don't any more - I grew up!      Just had the Christmas party this weekend - flight to the Highlands, posh hotel, top food, free bar and a leisure suite to recover in the next day.. Toodle pip!      In answer to a lot of bemused writers from mainland Europe and from across the Atlantic the whole point of a Christmas party is for everyone to get horribly drunk. If you get lots of people who work together in a room and keep them sober then you just get another day at work. However, give them all some alcohol and you get a more relaxed atmosphere that supplies everyone in the office with stories aplenty.     Shortly before the firm's Christmas party last year I was offered an excellent opportunity of three years work in India with a substantial rise. Unfortunately at the party I got terribly drunk and after spilling beer over my manager, and being reprimanded, I stormed out in disgust and shouted ""I resign"". Unluckily he wasn't drunk and it was accepted.      I find office parties a bit of a bore. People either get steaming drunk or talk shop all the time. Not my idea of fun.      A couple of years ago I attended a nice, swish, black-tie party in Edinburgh. After a very nice meal accompanied by a few bottles of wine, the comedian came on stage. One of my ex-colleagues decided to heckle him - a bad idea in the end. The comedian was Lee Hurst and he hates hecklers. She had to be led out of the building, send a letter of apology to Mr Hurst, and left the company a month or two later. We, however, found it enormously funny!      I just wanted to say that considering the fact that the Brits are meant to be the reserved ones we seem to be dispelling this vicious rumour very well. All I can say is it's Christmas - if you can't let your hair down at this time of year, when can you? Personally I feel bad that people look upon the Xmas party as a disgraceful display of behaviour. They should lighten up a little and get into the spirit of things.      Personally I think it more sickening that accountants actually work out how much money we lose in productivity to judge the worth of the Chrissy party. The worst I ever saw was a photo of one of our managers, naked from the waist down, asleep in a toilet cubicle with vomit all down his front. After rescuing him from the cubicle I had to carry him upstairs and place him on a hotel trolley, to wheel him outside to be picked up by his amused but somewhat worried wife. He never saw the photo, but the rest of the office did.      I have many fond memories of office Christmas parties in the UK. However, one that will stick in my mind for a long time to come, was the one at which I, as a senior manager, decided to do the trick of whipping a table cloth out from under a load of glasses. I had consumed a fair amount and overlooked the fact that nearly all of the glasses on the table were full! A wet and sticky evening was had by many.      The best Christmas party I had was in Ottawa where I went to an office party with my date and ended up meeting another man who is now my husband. How romantic!!      These stories are so funny. I want to come and work in England!      My last company's office party a couple of years ago was more debauched than normal. It took place in a new office that we had finished refurbishing that afternoon. They had made the mistake of hiring a proper cocktail bar with professional servers. Incidents were too numerous to go into detail but #1000 modern art pieces were covered in noodles, the freshly laid carpet was covered in sick and we were still drinking and indulging at 5am with the bemused cleaners cleaning around us. We all slept on the sofas in the boardroom, I reappeared at something past 9am walking through the office wearing my unbuttoned shirt, shorts and a wide grin.      To Evo, UK: Throwing noodles over a #1000 piece of modern art has probably at least doubled its value.      My company doesn't have a Christmas party. After reading all the accounts here of fights, drunkenness, insults, and vomiting in car parks, I'm glad we don't have one!      As an outsider I have come to the following conclusion. The Xmas party for the English is the equivalent of a social laxative for the general retentiveness that exists in the day-to-day office environment. The relaxed environment, with dollops of alcohol, results in the kinds of excesses that represent some kind of catharsis from the usual constipated English social inhibitions, or good old-fashioned stiff upper lip. This can be the only explanation of why so many people try to photocopy their backsides! Freud, eat your heart out.      At our last Christmas party I got drunk and called the boss a stupid idiot. Funny thing is I'm self-employed.      The perils of alcohol impairment and addiction aside, it's good to know that some people in Britain still know how to party. Drinking with your co-workers almost never happens in the hygienic US. The failure to cut loose together spawns a considerable barrier to mutual trust: do my co-workers have something to hide? Are they afraid of letting down their guard? In America, nobody knows.      Last year's Christmas party offered free cocktails. Within two hours, I had a few too many cocktails to handle. I went to use the toilet, but that was the beginning of the end of the evening for me. I went into the women's toilet by mistake, passed out while I was in there, and then vomited all over myself. Fortunately I had some good colleagues looking out for me! The next thing I remembered was waking up at 1pm the next afternoon. They got me out the women's toilet, drove me home, and washed my shirt and tie for me. This year's Christmas party is next Friday night. I'll probably do it all over again.      It is a sad reflection on the UK to see all these people who think getting drunk is fun. Maybe this is the reason we have a drink driving campaign every Christmas. And the sad reason why the number of deaths have gone up for the past couple of years.      Just think about the damaged property and healthcare cost that could be saved by having dry parties.      Went to an Xmas bash run by one of my customers in the Netherlands..... Got a but ""under the weather""..... Next thing I know, it's the following afternoon, I'm at the Railway Station in Lille (next country but one) and I'm unaccountably dressed as a Chorus Girl (a grim sight!).      I was at an office party and ended up going home with a very pretty workmate. Little did I know that she lived with the boss, who had invited everyone back while I was in the living room in a compromising position with my workmate. The return to work was very embarrassing.      I love your UK Christmas party stories. And as for all you Americans and we Canadians who don't want to say so, we do too spend much of the time wasted during and after Christmas parties, despite our restrictions.      Derek from Hong Kong obviously works for the wrong British bank. Our Christmas lunch starts with champagne, continues with wine and ends up with decanters of port. The first one to leave gets jeered! (I'd switch bank if I were you Derek!)      The British tradition of getting drunk does not really carry well to the other side of the globe. The British bank I work for does not appear to be anything like British. The annual event is capped with formal speeches, presentations and dinners. To make the event more memorable, the drinks are always limited to ten small cans of beer to a table of twelve.      I'm up for a Christmas bash. Pity the company I work for and my colleagues are not. Miserable swines.      Last year, I was told that California's liability laws forced the company to discontinue alcohol at any company function. So, the drinkers on the staff moved the party off-site and paid for it out of our own pockets. This year, I was told that the latest interpretation made me, a supervisor, liable if any staff became intoxicated, wandered back to the job and injured themselves. I now feel like I need to be in disguise to have a drink or a cigarette with staff. I would trade a month of sunny days for one really good English office party.      I went to the office party of the language school chain that I worked for in Sevilla - a four day alcoholic extravaganza that resulted in my firing. I arrived at the hotel, drank the minibar, went out all night and ended up being dragged out of the pool at 7.30am by two security guards, stark naked, then went into the 'business breakfast' room and tried to steal the coffee machine in front of 70 centre managers. Then missed the flight back, wound up in the wrong town and got barred from an Irish pub and arrested by the police for not being able to pay for a large rum bill and the hotel room.      It seems that people from the UK are proud of how drunk and sick they can get at the office party as almost all of your letters are from the UK. These type of parties, while not unknown, are rare in Canada due to our drinking laws      Barbara from Canada: There are loads of similar Christmas parties here in Canada. I don't know where in the country you live, but where I am there are many. I think you may want to get a position with a better company.      My most hilarious memory is the chap who, having had too much to drink, lost his false teeth down the toilet.      Our company party in the UK once got out of hand in a Greek restaurant. It ended with the human resources manager hitting the MD over the head with a plate, not realising that you are supposed to use specially supplied plates for this - I'm sure he woke up with a headache the next day....      I just do not understand why everyone must drink so much! It is a thing you English do that is most different from the French (and the Italians, and the Spanish)!      Having been taken out by the senior guys at work, they left me in a drunken mess asleep in one of London's exclusive clubs. The following morning I was still drunk enough to fall asleep in the toilet for two hours!! I later fell asleep during a meeting in front of my boss and his boss. I was asked not to return to work in the New Year.      Well lucky you lot...our company have decided not to have a Crimbo do this year - so we are all very dry and cheesed off.      Having read all these stories, is there anyone out there like me who cannot understand why a good proportion of the English do not consider that they have had a good time at Christmas without drinking to excess, being ill and feeling wretched the next day? In my experience it is rare to see such drunkenness on the continent, yet everyone still seems to be able to enjoy themselves without getting plastered.      My husband's company has a big children's party with Santa every year. One of the nice things about working there -- they also have a summer carnival with fair rides. Well, this year they gave the money to a New York charity, so no party. This is common, this year, across the Midwest. You Brits will have to do the drinking for us - we don't feel like it, this year.      We are civil servants and last year a former colleague was kicked out of our Christmas party for weeing on a Christmas tree - he was rather drunk. Another time I got a massive love bite from an Italian waiter. There is generally a lot of emotion at our parties.      Some of these stories (in addition to Tony Blair) are precisely the reason why we Americans love the UK.....      Our hospital had a Christmas ball with free wine provided all night. I decided to wear the red ribbon from the table around myself in a Mr. Universe style, and had a rather intimate dance with one of the department managers (who was very nice). Having descended the stairs to visit the loo, I found that I was unable to climb back up them. Feeling like I needed fresh air I grabbed my coat and went outside.      Sat on the marble steps of the posh hotel, I started to vomit in a scene similar to that of the Exorcist. Luckily, the friend who was driving me 20 miles home had brought a washing up bowl just in case. I spent the whole journey home with my head resting on the dashboard and face in the bowl being sick. The next day, all I could taste was red wine, and I didn't manage to get out of bed until the nausea went at 5pm. Needless to say, I missed out on anything with the nice department manager, I had to brush off the dried vomit off my hired dinner suit to return to the shop, and I tend to drink small amounts of wine now at Christmas parties!      I remember a few years ago, the staff party had a free bar in a local restaurant, and several of us had taken full advantage. The boss was talking to us about the future of our department and the next step forwards when the DJ put on the disco classic 'It's Raining Men' (pre-Geri). We abandoned our MD, and ran screaming to the dance floor. More surprisingly, we all still work here.      Last year I danced, ate and drank during the office end-of-year Christmas party. I won the man of the party award for the best performer. This did not go down well with my immediate boss because he too was eyeing the prize. He revisited the matter during the staff performance appraisal. He rated me very low saying that I can only perform at parties. This year I decided to boycott the end-of-year party for my boss. Once beaten I am twice shy. I have realized the truth- Christmas is for sober reflection.      #110 million cost per year? Who pinched my four quids' worth?      I got incredibly drunk at last year's Christmas party as I was nursing a broken heart and ended up putting on a display that would not have been out of place in a lap dancing club. I latched onto one of the guys who I thought looked half decent. I remember sucking his earlobe in the bar where the lights were full on, with his rather amused colleagues watching from all angles, Let's say that I got ribbed about it for several months afterwards and the bloke in question never came down to use the photocopier on my floor.      Christmas two years ago, my sister arrived at my home very drunk and very upset after her Christmas work party. It transpired that she really fancied this man at her workplace and just as she attempted to introduce herself to him for the first time, she proceeded to vomit all over him. I was very pleased to be a witness at their wedding this year! A very unique way to chat up a man!      At a previous company several years ago we were taken to a well-known American restaurant that served cocktails. The open tab on the bar allowed us to consume the majority of the cocktails on offer. So by the end of the night we were somewhat out of it. We then proceeded to pull down our trousers and moon at the police outside who had turned up to make sure no one was drink driving. This escapade got us kicked out, barred from the restaurant and a severe ticking off from the police.      Work parties from hell! I had a Christmas job at a well-known department store. On 25 October at 11am they squashed 20 of us into a tiny meeting room. We were handed a plastic cup, half full of a mixture of cheap wine and tap water. The manager explained that they didn't want us to get tipsy. This was accompanied by a cheap and nasty mince pie, which we stood and munched in silence. We were then filed out and the next set of staff were filed in. The whole thing took just over 10 minutes. It was the worst party ever but for all the wrong reasons. I left in mid-November to work for someone else!      In Canada employees who hurt themselves at office parties have started suing their employers for letting them get drunk - honest. So now the parties are dull with no more open bars.      Just a note of cheer for the intoxicated. Last December in Ontario a drunken woman left an office Christmas party, had a car accident and is now a paraplegic. Her employer, the Christmas party host, was found guilty of negligence and is currently responsible for a huge insurance pay out. Is drunkenness all it's cracked up to be?      My advice is to get as drunk as physically possible, so when it does come to the point of sneaking off with the MD's PA, you are either incapable of doing anything or too drunk to ever remember anything happening, or like me, learn the hard way!      At my very first Christmas party I was feeling very nervous as I had only been at the company, a rather prestigious investment bank, a few weeks so rather foolishly I drank very quickly to overcome my nerves. By 9pm I was dancing on the stage without my top on, by 9.15pm I was telling the head of my department exactly how brilliant I was at my job and that he should give me a pay rise. By 9.30pm I was staggering around the dance floor clutching an empty champagne bottle. My wonderful boss took pity on me, found my missing clothes and took me outside where I proceeded to be sick all over his shoes. He then put me in a cab and gave the driver the fare and sent me home. I did go into work the next day but I had the hangover from hell and I spent the day with my head down avoiding curious stares. It took about six months for the slagging to stop.      Last year's Christmas party started as usual at 11am in a restaurant for a big meal. After many drinks the party then moved onto a local pub, where some people stayed until closing. At around 10pm one rather drunk colleague tried to get a round of drinks, although they told him the bar was closed. This same person was later seen attached to a lamppost outside Embankment tube station. He never did make it into work the following day.      My company has just made us redundant, asked us to reapply for our own jobs, and will send out job offer letters on the day of the office Christmas party. I don't think many people will be turning up!      The last company I worked for had two Christmas parties. The official black-tie West End swanky do where everything was very boring and then the unofficial one where the rule was no girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives or cameras. The system worked very well. Seeing a colleague pour himself a pint through the roller shutter of the closed hotel bar using two snooker cues was my fondest memory of that company.      When I was a part timer years ago, I was caught with the boss's mistress in the computer room during the Xmas party. Needless to say he was slightly annoyed, but as he was terrified I would spill the beans to his wife, he let me off and offered to take me on full-time. I thought about it, told him to get lost and told his wife anyway.      Around four hours after entering the free bar party, I noticed myself pulling off my infamous Benny Hill routine. This involved me chasing various members of my team in a jazzed up walk. I then inserted sausage rolls into my ears and began to make kangaroo noises. My staff, I'm assured, still respect me.      I have been going to office Xmas parties for nearly 30 years and have never seen anything untoward. Either I have worked for the wrong/right companies (depends upon your point of view) or they are a bit of a myth.      Like Colin Mackay, I too have never seen anything untoward at an Xmas party. I've always been far too drunk to notice.      The road to hell is paved with good intentions. I arrived at my office party determined to stay sober. I arrived home again several hours later, smugly convinced that I'd succeeded, then spoilt it by laying my suit on the bed and climbing in the wardrobe.      At the last Christmas party the wine was free so like the stereotypical Scotsman I am I take full advantage of this and after polishing off all the bottles on my table I go round all the other tables and finish them too. It seemed a good idea at the time, but oh how I was mistaken. I left to get the last tube and it all went downhill from there, literally. I fell down the whole length of the escalators at Holborn station. I still wonder to this day how I actually survived. I missed the last train and decide to walk home to East Croydon. The next thing I remember is being at my door five hours later with my shoes in my hand and blood all over my feet. I actually made an appearance at work the next day although I did have a sore head, back, legs, arms, knees, and feet.      I worked for a global vehicle leasingAcar rental company in the 80's. One year they hired a function room overlooking the pitch at Old Trafford for the works Christmas do in the afternoon. The party was pretty poor until the DJ organized a game of musical chairs that involved removal of clothes. It ended up with all the directors running around the dance floor in their undies!      We had an office party last night, we all had a great night, drunk loads and I got dumped and then fell down four flights of stairs! Dragged myself into work today to find that there are only 10 people in out of about 80! I'm gutted.      I have been to many Christmas parties in the past where it is generally accepted that people will turn up a bit late and be a bit off-colour the next day. Non-attendance is frowned upon (if you can't handle it, don't drink it) but a general lowering of productivity is not only accepted, but also expected!      Two years ago my boss hired a very posh and glitzy wine bar for our Christmas bash. Because I had only been working at the company for two weeks, to make a good impression I started with just drinking water. By 7pm I was starting on the white, by 8pm I was on the red, then the spirits and then the slammers. Everyone was out of their heads by 10pm. The last thing I remember is laughing at my boss who was doing his Right Said Fred stripping routine. He started stripping off on the dance floor, lost his balance and fell straight into a waitress who was serving drinks. Being paralytic myself and losing all coordination, I could not remember any more than that. Going back to work on Monday was easy though because it turned out that my boss ended up completely stripped off and ran naked through Covent Garden. Someone called the police and he was taken into a cell for the night. After his strapping performance I couldn't look at him seriously again.      I took the more sensible precaution of not getting too drunk...and taking a camera to our Christmas party last night. We've had some laughs looking at the pictures this morning and I'm one of the few without a thumping head.      At our company Christmas party last year, after consuming too many free drinks a few of us got onto a table to dance, I fell off and although I was fine for the rest of the party, I was signed off work for the next two weeks with whiplash and couldn't remember anything about it!      One year my old company had a 'forties theme' fancy dress Christmas party. Myself and friend went dressed as GI's in Army uniforms. There was an authentic forties band with a singer in white dress and a dance troop dancing the jive for most of the night. I got chatting to a rather attractive young lady who was one of the dancers. We chatted for a while and at the end of the evening she asked if she could try on my GI Jacket (as she loved men in uniform). She gave me the jacket back as she had to leave. So I took my chance and asked her for her phone number. She looked back at me, gave me a sexy smile and said 'Its on a piece of paper in your jacket pocket' - It was the best chat up line I have ever heard - she bowled me over.      I used to work behind the bar of the largest student union in Wales. At Christmas, we used to hire out our great hall to companies. One year we had Marks and Spencer. The staff on duty that night made so much from tips (#100 or more), the signing up for the same shift the next year was oversubscribed 15 times!      Last year at our Christmas party, a (now ex) senior colleague who was very quiet - always the way - had a few wines too many to conquer his nerves. He subsequently groped all the women in the company (plus one or two of the men) and landed a punch on a colleague who was trying to move him outside. After a short exchange of punches, he walked off, vowing to get the train home. The next day, we had seen and heard nothing until he phoned in from hospital where he remained for some time with a smashed kneecap.      My personal favourite, from a party a good few years ago when photocopiers were still a novelty, was a young lady who managed to successfully obtain a very graphic image of not just her bottom. Foolishly she left a copy in the machine, which of course was copied and recopied several thousand times. Copies appeared all around the office, reached all four corners of the globe and still turn up at the bottom of desk drawers from time to time. As far as I know, the now not-so-young lady still works in the same company.      A work Christmas party in Bristol was a bit disappointing. The turkey was inedible and the IT boss ended up having to go back to work to sort out urgent problems.      At another, in London, I was unimpressed to end up with a pint of rather off beer... in a brewery. The following Monday, we received a message on our computer screens to tell us that a man's wedding band had been found in the brewery. I wonder why...      Two years ago while I was with a fish packing company we all got a little bit sloshed at the Christmas party. As a joke we decided to fill our manager's car with fish guts (normally used for fertiliser)! Well lets just say the car never recovered, guess that was at least #15,000 of the #110 million in festive damages!      The day after an office party should be given in goodwill as a holiday. That way your employees will love you and you won't lose so much money by trying to run a business were the work force is either absent or nursing a screaming hangover.      I've had my fill of Christmas parties so I'm giving ours a miss this year. While my colleagues will be getting smashed next Thursday evening, I'll be at home watching Walking With Beasts.      I hope I never get an invite to one of The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents' parties...      I was offered a job once at a company on the day of the departmental Christmas party and after a few drinks that evening I stumbled over to the divisional director who was talking to the MD to thank him for the job - they were not aware I had been taken on! At the company Christmas party a few days later, I was seated next to the MD who told me not to drink as much red wine as I had done on the Tuesday but that he was also a member of the company elite who had been sick in the car park the day after a Christmas party! What an induction that was!      One memorable year, I set fire to my boss by spilling a tray of vodka over him and a candle which was sat on the table next to him.      I would advise against singeing your boss' eyebrows when the pay reviews are due!      It was a sorry tale. At my last company's Christmas party a few years ago I went ahead and mixed my drinks. I was then ill, on the journey back, in the managing directors brand new car. Needless to say that I wasn't in work the next day due to the immensely bad hangover and the shame of what I had done the night before. Fortunately my boss was forgiving and I had no punishment for what I did. Except for the endless references at work and the odd paper sick bag that was left on my desk that is...      A few years ago we had our works Christmas drinks in our club which is behind the local shops and three young men gate crashed. They were very drunk and when one threw a punch at a male colleague I was so angry that I flung my arm round, caught him by the neck and threw him onto the floor. Luckily a number of male colleagues waded in and I crawled out from under the melee, minus my ear rings and one shoe. After the ensuing fight where the 3 men were thrown out my friend told me that the one I had punched lived near me and had just come out of prison after serving a sentence for GBH. Luckily I never saw him again.      I personally think it is a good idea for the University of Ulster, the college I'm attending, to allow students a three-week Christmas break. Students are well known for consuming, shall I say, more than the average level of intoxicating liquor. With Christmas fast approaching, it will probably be extra-indulgence by students, so it makes sense for the Uni, and I know other colleges are doing the same, to have a three-week Christmas break. If the Xmas break was any shorter, most students would probably be off recovering, anyway.      My company always takes the sensible precaution of having the Christmas Party on a Friday evening.      Rob, thats the best idea yet, we always have them mid week, which is such a killer. I would pays loads to not have to get out of bed the next day       Well said Susan S, I'm doing the same. As a mate of mine once said: ""Just because I work with you doesn't mean I have to socialise with you."" "

Two words:     Why do 24-hour shops have locks?      1.Napoleo C    2.Vanity      Ron Williams - I've heard a theory on this one, yes it does centre around the way battles were fought on horseback. When cavalry units charged at each other they would wheel to the left to bring the sword arm into action. A general trained his cavalry to wheel right instead and the next battle was won decisively as the opposition couldn't cope with the new tactic. Perhaps other contributors can confirm if this was a ploy used by the French or some other European nation. I'd like to know if there is a scientific reason why I find driving on the right more natural than driving on the left. Admittedly this is on a motorcycle so there is no problem with the steering wheel being on the other side. I've been driving in the UK for over 25 years yet find it takes longer to re-adjust to driving on the left on my return than the reverse.      Are the words 'lisp' and 'stutter' cruelly designed to be difficult for the afflicted person to pronounce?      How does the non-stick material stick to the pan?      Why does the phone ring as soon as I get in the shower? Why does somebody knock on the door just as I go to the loo? In these days of ""equality"" why do the majority of women still get the house, kids, car etc after a divorce even when they are the ones who have been unfaithful?      Many of the questions here are about sod's law - why does the 'phone ring when I'm in the shower, why do toothaches happen when dentists are closed etc. The answer is that we select those particular events for focus, and ignore the times when what happens is not frustrating. This is because we have an innate belief in some sort of a God, and tend to take events personally.      What colour is a mirror?      Why is a ""computer error"" always invoked when something goes wrong in a computer system? 99 times out of 100, the error is due to operators or computer analysts like me, not to the poor computer itself!      Why do insurance companies give you some dazzling logic when it comes to replacing items stolen during burglaries? My very expensive guitar was considered old - it was 25 years old; applying some pro rating process they gave me something around 1/20 of its market value. I asked if age is your criteria to establish value, how much should a 300 year old Stradivarius be worth?...No answer      Insurance companies happily take our money to line their pockets, but why do they make it as hard as possible when we need to make a claim?      Why are my trains always running late, yet when I'm running late they are on time and I miss them?      Can science explain the question even Sigmund Freud couldn't answer: What the heck do women want? Also, can science prove God exists?      Why are all the pigeons, all over the world, the same size? Don't they have any babies or OAPs (old age pigeons)? And where do they bury their dead? I've never seen any corpses in Trafalgar Square or any other square in any city.      Why are we still so fascinated by the so-called Roswell UFO incident and what is the latest official line on it. Why is it that whenever there is a dramatic event in the heavens, such as the meteor shower of Nov 18th, the sky is obscured by clouds?      Why do stores give you a slush puppie with all that ice water when all you really want is that sweet sweet syrup?      Why does my Mum always manage to phone me when I have just sat down to eat my dinner? Has she a psychic link to my oven? Is this normal Mum behaviour?      Why does time go so fast when you are close to exams, why doesn't time always go slow, I see no reason for it to go any faster? We could enjoy the good times so much more?      If the universe is expanding and the universe is all there is, what is it expanding into?      To Len, Finland: The universe is not expanding *into* anything. You only expect the concept of ""expanding into"" because you are only familiar with situations in which space is a constant - where there is always ""space"" to ""expand into"". The fact is that the universe *is* space, and it therefore cannot both *be* space and expand *into* space at the same time. We have to think of the stuff outside of the universe like an equation or something else non-spatial, otherwise our minds will make these misconceptions.      Why do fast food outlets always forget your extra serving of supersized fries? And why is this not discovered until you're about two miles down the road?      How does a cow know it's not a butterfly dreaming it is a cow?      Why do people listen to grunge music?      If a tree falls in the forest, with no one around to hear, does it make a sound?      To Alison, UK: Sound is the interpretation of air waves (just like water waves, but in the air!) by a brain. The air waves are detected by an ear and translated into ""sound"" by the brain. If there is no ear with a brain within range, there can be no translation from the air wave into ""sound"". So in conclusion, if nobody is around to hear the tree, it makes no sound.      If a man is standing in the forest and he says something and there is not a woman there to hear him, is he still wrong.      Why do people stop everything to answer the phone? A client is interviewed when the phone rings, he/she is completely ignored while the other person answers the phone. Wouldn't it be fairer to have telephone appointments as well?      Why couldn't the kids on Scooby Doo figure out that the villain was always the person(s) they met in passing at the beginning of each episode?      Why do ladies always wait until they are stationary at their front door before starting to look for their keys? And why do they unfailingly wait until they've reached the front of a long checkout queue before trying to locate their money in the murky depths of a deep handbag?      Why does a toothache always happen on a Saturday or Sunday when all dentists are closed?      Toast always lands buttered side down. Cats always land on their feet. If you fix a slice of toast, butter side up, to the back of a cat, what happens when the cat falls to the floor? Some say it will spin rapidly just above the floor and can be used to make a perpetual motion machine.      If you strapped a buttered piece of toast to the back of a cat, would the two items hover?      Why don't US and UK forces use the hide and seek method to find Bin Laden - pull out all troops and talk about something else until he thinks the coast is clear, then when he comes out assassinate him? Also why is Bart Simpson the same age despite having had at least 3 birthdays on the show?      Ah, the great mysteries of life! Why do we park in a driveway and drive on the parkway? And which did come first, the chicken or the egg??      Why are rabbits not green? The camouflage effect could be devastatingly useful.      Frank Hollis and Chris B - Thanks for answering my question. I'm glad you both actually understood what I was asking, since the other respondents clearly didn't. Does this mean that I can now claim to be related to Barbra Streisand?      If you work on the basis that your ancestors produced offspring roughly every 25 years so that every 25 years you go back the number of ancestors you have doubles (two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents etc.) then this means that 1,000 years ago you had 1,099,511,627,776 ancestors. If you go back much further then you'll have more ancestors than there are people on the planet. This doesn't seem logical but my head hurts when I try to think about it.      Terra from England: That conundrum was solved a long time ago. The reason there aren't more ancestors than offspring is because we share our ancestors with other people. Your brothers and sisters do not each have their own separate lineage, after all.      Eden Alvernaz, USA: That isn't what I was asking. I was talking about just my ancestors. If my ancestors double every 25 years you go back (and I don't mean cumulatively) then you'll end up with more ancestors than there were people on the planet.      To Terra: Eden did in fact answer your question. You do not have 'your' ancestors, as they are shared by a lot of other people. All families are 'old' families. You cannot separate out your ancestors from someone else's as they are shared. That is precisely why the numbers don't work out the way you say.      Terra - with regards to your ancestors - yes there would be more people than currently on the planet, however they are dead and did not live at the same time so do not make up a total of the population. The world is after all thousands of years old so there will be many many more people having inhabited the planet than currently live on it.      Terra, England. That's an easy one. As you trace your family tree back you'll find it crosses over regularly. So your mother and father may each have had the same great-great (repeat 10 times) -great grandfather. Indeed scientists have determined that we all share one particular individual as an ancestor - known as the 'Mitochondrial Eve'.      Terra, England: the answer to your question is inbreeding. By way of an example: if you take the population of a small and isolated island and theorise about the number of their ancestors 20 generations ago, you might find they should have been stacked 5 deep the length and breadth of the island. In-breeding across and between previous generations greatly retards the logarithmic increase in the number of our ancestors and helps us make the most of our available space!      To Rt, Kenya, people are usually quiet in elevators because the walls are so much closer: they can hear how loud/ pompous/ pretentious they sound, feel embarrassed and shut up!      Why do grown adults think Jar Jar Binks was created for them?      Why do birds suddenly appear? Were they hiding or waiting for you? Is this some sort of private joke between you and the birds?      If Murphy's law can go wrong, will it? When the person inventing the drawing board made a mistake, where did he go back to? Why is abbreviation such a long word? Is there a club called ""extroverts anonymous""? If a pear messes up, what shape does it go?      Why does any computer system access information at half the usual speed when you have a customer on the phone? Why can you never type straight when someone is watching what you are doing? Why does the boss always stop by your desk when there's something marginal on screen?      Why is the road always clear while you're getting into the car, and putting your seatbelt on, but incredibly busy the moment you start to back out of the driveway?      Why do people stay on the middle lane of the motorway, doing 50 mph when the inside lane is empty?      When we travel, why do we go ""down South"" yet ""up to London"". And also why is there only one monopolies Commission?      In the early days of the railways the up line was the one to London, hence going up to London      I am always mystified at the immense lengths that some car drivers will go to, to gain a few seconds or take a short cut, but will make no effort at all to secure their children in the back of the car.      Why do the buttons on telephones start with '1 2 3' on the top row, but on calculators they start with '1 2 3' on the bottom row? Why can't they be configured the same?      Why are people usually quiet in elevators?      Why does your new appliance always break down, two days after the warranty expires? And why does hot water freeze faster than cold water? Surely at some point the hot water will get to the same temperature as the cold and they will freeze at the same rate from that point on?      To Graham: Hot water has less oxygen, oxygen slows the freezing process      To Paul, it's got nothing to do with Oxygen content. H2O is H2O, the only difference between hot and cold is that in hot the H2O molecules are bouncing around much faster. Hot water freezes more quickly than cold water because if you place them in say, a fridge, there is a much steeper temperature gradient between the hot water and the fridge than between the cold water and the fridge. This causes a much more rapid heat transfer from the water to the fridge! It's got nothing to do with chemistry, its just thermodynamics.      To B Roberts, UK: The only portion of thermal dynamics involved in the hot water freezing first, is the extent of the hot water forming a temporarily melted bridge to the surrounding areas in which the containment vessel is in contact with. It therefore has a much more efficient transfer of thermal energy. Conduction vs. convection? I may be wrong.      To B Roberts: It is impossible for it to be true that something hot can freeze before something cold does. Just because the temperature gradient is steeper, it does not mean that it will reach the temperature quicker. By the logic you give, you would expect the reverse of this to be true too. A frozen meal should cook faster than a meal that has been kept in the fridge - because there is a greater temperature difference and therefore steeper gradient. This obviously does not happen!      To Graham, UK et al. Regarding the problem of hot water freezing faster than cool water. It's A-level physics. The solution is in the initially dominant form of heat transport, that is evaporation or conduction. If we use a thermally insulated open container then, initially, the dominant form of heat transport is evaporation.      The effect of evaporation is two fold, firstly the liquid cools, secondly the mass of liquid is reduced. The level of evaporation from a hot liquid is higher than from a cool liquid. So the hot liquid cools rapidly AND the mass of liquid is significantly reduced. On the other hand evaporation is low from the cool liquid, so the liquid cools slowly and maintains a relatively constant mass. As the mass of the initially hot liquid has been reduced it has proportionately less thermal energy to dissipate, so continues to cool at a faster rate. Thus hot water, under certain conditions, can freeze faster than cool water.      Why do outside news reporters adopt strangely affected intonations while those in the studio speak normally?      Toast fall butter side down because in the time it takes to fall from the desk to the floor it can only rotate 180?. If however desks were twice as high toast would land dry side down. Try pushing a piece of toast off with the buttered side touching the plate.      If exceptionally a slice of buttered toast falls on the floor buttered side up, does that mean that it was buttered on the wrong side?      If humans evolved from monkeys, why is it that monkeys still exist?      How come no-one has minted a 99p coin? Everything seems to cost #1.99, #2.99, 99p. Just think of the copper it would save.      We live in a world of starts and finishes, beginnings and ends, births and deaths. The world had a beginning so, apparently did the universe (big bang). But there must be an ultimate 'space' in which our universe exists that just 'is'. It didn't have a beginning and may not have an end. How can anything exist without being created from something bigger? This thought is totally baffling to me. My brain just cannot conceive the idea.      To Roger Sayer: the reality of this situation is quite depressing. Things do what they do and only what they do. Us humans perceive our surroundings in a way that has proved useful to our survival as the gene-vessels we are. Our function is not to understand all about the universe, at this stage of our development at least. No doubt a cat perceives things differently, has different concepts that it's mind will attempt to apply to what it perceives. The point is that we may never get an answer to our question, because like a cat wondering of the sun ""can i kill it?"", the difficulty lies in the unsuitability of the question. We may have come to a head in terms of our ability to understand the universe in our current state. Perhaps it is time to look at ourselves before we once again move forward ""out there""...      To Roger Sayer, USA, scientists and quantum physicists have been wrestling with that same problem; they refer to it as the turtle syndrome; the creation of the earth is one turtle sitting on top of another that was the big bang that sits on top of another that was an even bigger bang. However, the scientists and the physicists cannot get to the turtle at the bottom and guess what, some are starting to believe in a superior being that created everything.      Gerry, Scotland - any idea what created the supreme being? Another supreme being? To follow the ""turtle"" theory will scientists get to the supreme being at the bottom? Can't stop I'm about to try my paw at killing the sun.      Why do people stand by pedestrian crossings without pressing the button? And also, Gerry - nice stuff about the turtles. But where did the ""supreme being"" come from then?      To Jake Hadlee: That is a phenomenon generally observed in London. It's due to the fact that there is no discernible correlation between pushing the button and having the light change in the pedestrian's favour. Most of the crossings I've tested (yes on my own time without pay - I'm such a dedicated scientist) exhibit a seemingly random pattern of changing lights. The buttons are only there to give the pedestrians something to do while waiting for a break in traffic.      How is it that we can put a man on the moon, but back on planet earth we're reduced to clawing and shredding the first ten meters of the toilet paper roll?      Why do people have to ""spend"" more to ""save"" money?      Why can't I write my essay on time for once, instead of procrastinating by reading BBC Talking Point debates?      To Paul, UK, the answer is that humans did not evolve from monkeys but that they both evolved from a common ancestor. That is why monkeys are still around!      Hannah in Oxford asks why she can't write her essay on time for once instead of procrastinating by reading these debates. The answer is ""because she is human"". Never put off until tomorrow that which you can put off until next week.      Who finances scientists to conduct such meaningless research?      Why does food always stick to the non-stick pans when my mother-in-law is coming to dinner?      Why do cups always have the handle on the right-hand side?      And where can I get one of those baseball hats with a peak at the back?      Why I am able to fathom out the functions on a brand new remote control, operate a computer (and keep it perfectly maintained) and open a 'tetrapak' carton of milk without spilling any of the contents in a shorter space of time than a man...      If you can be disgruntled - can you be gruntled? Also - we have drive-thru cashpoints over here - why do the buttons also have braille on them?      Why is it more socially acceptable to be warm than to have fresh air e.g. sitting on a crowded, stuffy bus in the winter with all the windows shut? After all, we're all wearing our coats, aren't we?      Why do helicopter captains sit in the right (starboard) seat, while airplane captains sit in the left (port)?       When a stream of people are going through one half of a two-door entrance or exit, why do people wanting to go the other way stand by the closed door and wait for them? Am I really the only person alive with the sense to OPEN the remaining door and go through it? And when I do, why does everyone look at me as if I'm the idiot? "
HOC HOC-EB -2.32 " My favourites include T.S. Eliot for the bleak and unforgiving ""Wasteland"" and ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" (although ironically I have no time for his ""Practical Cats"" work); the sonnets of Shakespeare (especially ""My mistress's eyes are nothing like the sun . . .""); Virgil's Aenied; the haiku of Ezra Pound; the poignant work of Sylvia Plath and the wonderfully whimsical nonsense poetry of Spike Milligan. My only regret is that in recent years I have neglected reading poetry in favour of reading prose.      A poem I enjoy, which seems to have some significance is The Charge of the Light Brigade by Alfred Lord Tennyson. Especially the line ""Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to do and die"". In the present times, it seems to fit our everyday situations.      A poem is no use at all, a completely useless thing. It merely messes words around, to give a pleasant ring. However to be serious the lines, ""What if this life if full of care, we have no time to stand and stare"" is a relevant phrase for today's world, and a reminder that previous generations rushed about and missed the beauty of life as well.      I've just remembered this short poem, don't know if this is the whole thing, or who wrote it, but it, to me, sums up the general feeling towards the US at the moment: Woodman, woodman, spare that tree, Touch not a single bough, For as a child it sheltered me And I'll protect it now      I must say, The White Man's Burden by Kipling is my favourite poem. It's a sarcastic poem, while feigning support for Imperialism, it actually derides Imperialism.      My favourite poem is The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost. Every person has that Road Not Taken in his/her life, at many a times in their lifetime. Its a tribute to every person's state of mind, when they have to make a difficult choice in life.      I'm the little boy that gives up his favourite teddy bear so that a stranger may be comforted. I'm the single mother who has been trying to teach her child to sleep in their own bed, who holds them tight long into the night, thanking God it wasn't her child that died. I'm the old man, angry and resentful that his military doesn't want him because of his age. I'm the teenage girl that spends hours cutting ribbons for others to wear as a symbol of remembrance. I'm the young man who doesn't understand why his father was running up the stairs as the building fell, trying to save just one more person, instead of saving himself.      I'm the old woman who will never see her grandchild again. I'm the little girl, playing with her doll, who can't understand when someone screams hateful things at her because of where her family is from. I'm the police officer, trying to keep reporters safe, when his wife is still among the missing. I'm the fire fighter that called in sick that day, only to discover that someone else died in his place. I'm the man who survived the falling building only to learn that his sister and baby niece were in the plane. I'm the secretary, angered by the seemingly callous response of those around her. I'm a spelunker, who is climbing down into the remains of a building, hoping to find someone still alive.      Ithaca by the Greek poet C P Cavafy. An invitation to voyage far and fear nothing, save the fear inside you that must be conquered.      Robert Browning wrote a marvellous narrative poem about a man who simply ""dropped out"" and vanished into the crowds of the world. ""What's become of Waring, since he gave us all the slip?"" How many days have I dreamed of giving everyone and everything the slip.      My favourite poem of all time is Frost's Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening. Not just because I can identify with every word as it describes the beauty of an evening quieted by snow, but the last verse: ""The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep."" I have quoted this to myself many a time when I felt the allure of something better than the present crisis, whatever that may have been. I once read a commentary made by Frost when asked what this poem really meant. He said he would not say. He said he was amazed that so many people had found various different meanings in his poem, that he did not want to somehow interfere with other people's interpretations by sharing his. I've got the entire poem memorised. Anybody want to hear it?      No coward soul is mine No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere For I see Heaven's glories shine And Faith shines equal, arming me from fear Emily Bront E    Lepanto by G K Chesterton. It is a work that seethes with joyous optimism. Also, Choosing a Mast by Roy Campbell - a poet sadly neglected and underrated by contemporary critics.      I've always loved Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Inspired by the diary of Marco Polo that was fashionable reading at the time (along with some other ""inspiration""), it's a fantastically evocative vision of the mysterious beauty that must have truly astonished the famous traveller.      The most entertaining travel poem is The Hunting of the Snark by Lewis Carroll. I'd hunt a snark any day!      One of my favourite poems is ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" by Dylan Thomas. It's a very uplifting and powerful piece.      Some very expressive poetry was written during the First World War - poets like Wilfred Owen, Siegfried Sassoon, Isaac Rosenberg. It works for me even now.      The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock, by T.S. Eliot is by far the best poem I know. It is so many things all at once. It says so much about the world. I really just marvel at the genius of it.      John Betjeman's poems are the best. Everything else pales in comparison. My favourite is Executive. (I think that's the name).      My own favourite is this (and I admit I am biased!) A Beach Poem I see the blue sky and the blue green sea I hear the waves crash together I touch the golden sand and it runs through my toes I taste the salty water in my mouth I smell the salty sea I feel the soft sand under my feet I wish I could stay there for ever. Written by my daughter at the age of 7.     Coleridge's ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" has always had a special place with me. It paints with words, defining the Impressionist movement long before it happened. The nearest visual thing I have seen is some of Turner's early work. Its grasp on the emotions is as tenacious as the greatest symphony. An allegory of life and death, the poem embraces hope, faith, despair and terror with equal facility. It is an incredible work of art that hurdles time with an easy contempt.     Rimbaud's Genie - amazing to think it was written in the 1870's. A beautiful invocation of the unattainable, a challenge that most poetry since has failed to live up to. Also Shelley's Ozymandias, which is a perfect, measured attack on the futility of absolutism. And Marvell's Bermudas, for its joy and sense of renewal.      Poetry in its best sense is a form of creativity with words, which is why I love the works of George Herbert so much. On a beautiful sunny morning three years ago, I went to Bemerton near Salisbury, where he once ministered as a simple country parson. What captivated me was a poem of his called The Flower, which I saw on a poster on the church wall. I remarked to one of the parishioners that, as the work of an inspired mind, it's as fresh as if it were written this morning!       Not really a travel theme, but certainly relevant at the moment and a reminder of the personal devastation that war can bring. It is by E A Mackintosh and is called In Memoriam. It is relatively unknown, but it is the most moving poem I have ever read. The last three verses read: ""You were only David's father, but I had fifty sons, when we went up in the evening under the arch of the guns, and we came back at twilight - O God! I heard them call, to me for help and pity that could not help at all. Oh never will I forget you my men that trusted me, more my sons than your fathers', for they could only see, the little helpless babies and the young men in their pride, they could not see you dying and hold you when you died. Happy and young and gallant, they saw their first born go, but not the strong limbs broken and the beautiful men brought low, the piteous writhing bodies, they screamed, don't leave me, Sir, for they were only your fathers but I was your officer."" Worth reading the full five verses. "
HOC HOC-ER -0.05 " Whenever the media has news fall into its lap it over-reacts and saturates us with interminable rehashes of specials, repeats and pundits all going over the same ground time after time. The USA crisis is the latest example. In one session the second plane hitting the twin towers was shown at least 14 time in less than 5 minutes and totally lost it impact and horror. I no longer know what is happening as the overexposure has made me turn way from the news in a search for something more original.      It is quite hard to find out what is going on and I was bothered by screams of pure evil! and edition after edition of local papers with horror identikit photos of suspects. I don't need to be stirred, I am already stirred. I will not buy a newspaper again, long live the net. I'll stick with the beeb for its lack of rhetoric and clear un-emotive use of language.      I am saturated with news. Every angle has been exposed, every bit of information has been published. I'm numb. I lost two wonderful friends in NYC and DC. It is hard enough trying to regain composure after personal losses but to see the graves of my friends and many other loved ones on TV over and over again freshens the hurt. We need to move onbut not forget. However, with the media's attention, it is very difficult.      At the turn of the century, Winston Churchill said that the ""American press is vulgar and without substance"". I think that quote has pretty much held up over the years. Sensationalism, inciting backlash against Muslims and Middle Eastern people in general, the talking heads spinning out of control - and those are just some of the nicer things that I can think of to say about the news coverage of this horrible event.      Coverage in the US has followed predictable patterns: jingoistic banter on conservative stations like Fox, overblown predictions of impending war on the big networks and overall very little meaningful analysis. Highest praise goes to NPR, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the BBC. All are taking a clearheaded approach to what they report; the BBC, it seems to this American, has gone out of its way to show Muslims for what they are: neighbours, co-workers, friends - in short, dignified humans.      The most nauseating cynical piece of reporting was that reported in the press here, where a woman reporter, when interviewing a relative of a missing person, stage whispered to her producer ""That's a soundbite. Did you get that soundbite?"" The very worst of shallow America. The victims deserved better. Watching it live on Channel 4 I was so moved by Jon Snow's reaction when the second of two buildings he clearly knew and loved began to crumble and fall. Now that's reporting.      I have just watched the news and was disgusted to see the item about how the US tragedy is affecting Asian communities in the UK. What about how the tragedy is affecting others? I live in an area with a large Asian population and have been disgusted at some of their behaviour since last Tuesday. There have been open celebrations on the street, the UK and US flags have been burned outside a local town hall and fireworks were set off on Friday at 11 a.m. I have seen nothing of this in the news and find it difficult to believe that these were isolated incidents.      I just wanted to express my gratitude for the empathy expressed by the great people of the UK. Here in Boston, I cannot receive the BBC. I feel like a captive of the CNN political machine. I always find myself refreshed while travelling overseas to places like Japan where the BBC is side by side with CNN. I cannot overstate the comfort we Americans feel when our brothers in Britain stand by our side. God bless you all,      The media coverage was excellent but I felt that they initially jumped to a lot of conclusions and also broadcast premature reports. They said that the State Department was car bombed and that was nerve-wracking because my Mom works in DC. That report turned out to be false. Overall coverage has been excellent and in-depth.      I did appreciate the American networks' initial breaking coverage of the attacks. After a day or so though, the coverage by US media began to feel a little overwhelming, what with all the shots of the second airliner hit.      By now, it almost seems like US coverage is State-run. It seems to be not only interested in the human toll, but also it seems to be fomenting this blind patriotic fervour that yells, 'Let's get 'em!'And no one seems to be effectively questioning the intricacies of the true situation in the Middle East, and our TRUE interests in that region.      Your coverage is informational, but your historic bias in favour of Arab terrorists compounds their atrocities. BBC has failed to give an accurate picture of anti-American, anti democratic and anti-Jewish hatred in the Arab World. Instead it panders and propagates the propaganda of Palestinian terrorists and hate-filled Arab extremist clerics.      It is hard for us here in the US to believe that we are hated to this degree. What have we done to deserve this?      Although I am proud of our free press, it should be remembered that with freedom comes responsibility. In the west we hear very little of the suffering our governments inflict upon Arab nations. Only last week civilians died in Iraq because of US/UK bombing but we heard nothing of it. I only hope that people don't believe all they hear in the coming weeks, somehow we are hearing what our governments want us to hear.      I have been watching NBC's coverage mainly and have been impressed with their journalistic skills. Fortunately I have not seen any of the more grim pictures (despite watching the news every day) which people in Britain seem to have seen. It has to be said, though, that the media has only helped to foster the growing fear and paranoia here. They really need to have people from countries that have been affected by terrorism bringing a more sane and less hysterical approach.      Many people here are acting as if life somehow has to change completely and that they aren't safe - the media has to counter this idea by informing people better about the rest of the world, in particular at the moment about those countries which are affected daily by the threat of terrorism.      You are doing a very good job. You are the only source of the information for many foreigners in Japan. I also feel that we all around the globe as well as in your studios need to hear from the spiritual leaders of the world and to have a chance to pray together for peace. I believe that you have an enormous power for the dissemination of information. I also believe you have no less power for bringing us together by giving us the chance to pray together for peace and love on this planet.      I thought the first couple of days coverage was excellent on UK terrestrial television. But having seen the horror repeated so many times my senses have slightly dulled. Certainly with the video and film, less is more.      I am suspicious about the events surrounding the crash of the hijacked airliner Flight 93. I would like to be sure that the airliner was not in fact shot down by the American Air Force. Dick Cheney seemed to be preparing the way for such an event in his comments earlier this week, which only adds to my concern. At present I don't see a good explanation as to why the airliner should have crashed. There were apparently no firearms on board and as I understand it none of the other hijacked planes had any explosives smuggled in. There also seems to me to be comparatively little media coverage of that crash. I hope that we get the truth on what happened, rather than a cover-up. A decision to shoot the plane down would not have been unreasonable in the tragic circumstances, but one can well imagine the damage that such an act could have on the popularity of the present US administration.      Our media are an embarrassment. I have begun almost exclusively listening to the BBC because they're more balanced and emotionally detached.      I believe that the media in the US has done a fine job of covering every angle of this tragedy. I have watched coverage from every major network and local stations, and when television is not available I listen to public radio. There have been some inaccurate reports and overkill on some stories, but because of the magnitude of this disaster, that is to be expected. However, the report from BBC correspondent, Jonathan Duffy, regarding the ""Forgotten Victims"" was totally inaccurate. The US media has covered the story of these victims and anguish of their survivors many times. My heart goes out to them.      I stopped watching the coverage when an NBC reporter asked one of the Firemen to describe what the mangled human remains looked like.      I am afraid that the perpetrators won the media round also, making it strike two for them, by alienating the peaceful silent majority of Muslims who will never see common ground with terrorists. Islamic terrorists. How many times have I heard this sentence in the last week. And why when followers of other religions commit a crime their acts are not pinned to their religions? I think that the media played into the terrorists' hands.      I do believe that no one should have showed images of people jumping out of the towers and falling to their deaths. My local paper had several stills of this. Totally sick.      So far this has not been war - it has felt like war, looked like war, and the media have gone along with the politicians and reacted almost as if it was war, but it was a terrorist attack. The phrase ""war on terrorism"" is an irresponsible one, because it seems to pre-justify allowing an escalation to war, which could happen, and which incidentally is exactly what the terrorists want. The media coverage has at times contained an element of preparing the public for such an escalation, which is very unfortunate.      On that terrible day, was it really necessary to replay, over, over and over again, the moment when the second hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Centre? In the days that followed, new footage was obtained, showing those moments of impact from almost every angle possible. It seemed like almost every channel was at it. In some cases, days later, it was still being shown in the background as studio-based reporting and discussions were taking place.      Yes, of course we have to see and acknowledge the full horror of such events for what they are, but in my opinion, some of the coverage went beyond the boundaries of good taste, and showed a lack of sensitivity towards the victims and their bereaved relatives and friends.      The UK media have covered the topic well. I make one plea - that ALL the UK papers make a clear editorial statement or top-of-front-page plea to all people in the UK for the next few weeks - that the Muslim people of the UK are also OUR people and friends, not fundamentalists trying to wipe out the western world.      Like in any religion and/or society, there will always be fanatics but Anglo-Saxon peoples should continue to work alongside and be close to our Muslim friends and neighbours, and others of various faiths and creeds. The press could carry this important message to the UK and help quell the irrational anger appearing in some sections of UK society.      It's not the amount of coverage that bothered me - it was the content. For example, the suicide attackers' names should not have been released. Now they will be hailed as martyrs to their cause and have got exactly what they wanted. Many of the stories, such as how Bin Laden is being pursued, we do not need to know.      I was sickened by the constant repetition of the picture of the second plane flying into the tower (on all channels). On that Tuesday it was shown over and over again, often as a backdrop while more news was reported. Once it was established that there were innocent passengers involved, I was appalled to think that someone might be watching those pictures aware that someone they loved was, or might have been, on the plane. The incredible dramatic appeal of that picture was obvious; but what we were actually watching was people dying.      The innocent casualties in NY are described as horrific. The potential innocents killed for revenge against an [as yet unproven] target are described as ""collateral damage"". Need any more be said?      I was quite impressed by some of our broadcasters the first two days of the attack (particularly ABC, Peter Jennings was terrific). However, I felt that we did not need 24/7 coverage and that the networks were struggling for news. While not appropriate the first few days to look at the why, I think it is appropriate now, and no network is truly looking at why someone might want to do this to the US. I've been watching the BBC for a more objective view.      I just love the arrogance of the British press and all the letter writers who urge President Bush to listen carefully to what Tony Blair has to say and not to keep him out of the loop. We all know how experienced Blair is at dealing with terrorists. He hasn't even arrested the Omagh bombers yet!      The coverage has been quite thorough, but also quite one-sided. There has been little mention of the USA's lack of caring about terrorism in the past in other countries or their support for groups like the IRA. Journalism is about finding out the facts and rooting out the truth. Why is nobody asking these questions? The people have a right to know, after all....      I didn't care for all the testosterone-laden war talk in the media last week, but this week things appear to be settling down. Today I noticed USA Today did a front page story on what could have triggered the attacks, and mentioned the bombings in Iraq, western cultural and economic dominance which clashes with Muslim culture, among other things. As far as TV's concerned, I agree with those who say it's in overdrive. Regular programming has been pre-empted and often there isn't that much to say. Thank God for cable! Yes, the bombings are an important story, but sometimes we need to get away from it for a little while      I believe that some of the media have sensationalised this terrible event. It was very disrespectful to the dead and their families to show people hanging and jumping out of the buildings moments before the buildings collapsed and also to show bodies being removed from the scene - there are families out there who are grieving and don't need to see these last pictures of their loved ones.      I wish to congratulate the media on their coverage of the devastating attacks in the USA. I, like the rest of the world, watched with horror as the true extent of the attack unfolded, those reporting must have been equally horror- struck. I don't think I could have addressed the world as they did with determination and dignity amid immense human suffering.      The events of last Tuesday will stay in people's minds forever and rightly so. The media coverage of the attacks was not voyeuristic or intrusive but an account of a truly harrowing occasion. The media has a responsibility to relay the news to all. And it did so, showing the devastation and heartbreak of the American people that these despicable acts of violence caused.      The media showed the world the true victims of terrorism. Instead of placing blame on America and others, let us remember that thousands of innocent people - Americans, Britons, Hispanics the list goes on - are dead, do their lives not count? Are their lives worthless? My heart goes out to all those that lost their lives and their families.      I have watched coverage on all the major networks and feel that it has been biased towards ""white"" Americans and the anguish they feel. Being Sikh myself I feel that the media could have done more to educate people that innocent members of the community are being attacked, and the fact is wasn't only ""white"" Americans that had been murdered in this atrocity.     After the first shock from the events in NY, we were exposed to all kinds of coverage by the media and we listened to many messages and opinions. Some observers, journalists made a genuine effort to see the events in their entirety. Today we were exposed to a series of wise thoughts brought by one of your guest speakers Tony Benn during the programme Hard Talk with Tim Sebastian. I believe we should listen carefully to his words of wisdom and the encouragement of caution.      I agree with Mat Allen; the media seem to have gone into overdrive on this, bad as it is. For how long will we be subjected to ""new angle"" shots of hundreds of people dying as their plane hits the building? Wouldn't it be great if the news only showed us something new, without going into intricate grisly detail about everything again and again? And as for the phone calls; I can't help but feel that the media are trying to make a soap opera of the whole event.      The media coverage has been incredibly in-depth and informative. However, there could be a more intensive look at the views of the Muslim community and why there is a deep hatred amongst many of them for the US and the West. Maybe then the public will realise that peace can be reached without the need to take more innocent life.      I cannot believe the media, and the way they have been promoting mass hysteria. Yes, it was a major attack, but they went overboard, and the innocent Muslims all over are paying the price... being spit upon on the streets, and generally mistreated.. they did not deserve this and the media is to blame. Frankly, I think the Islamic community in the US should sue a couple of newspapers over this and the way they reported it.      The media needs to calm down. Throughout the whole affair they have exaggerated events or even reported information as fact when it has later been proven false. The media needs to clarify its information instead of reporting every rumour as soon as it is mentioned!      Unsurprisingly, I am totally disappointed with the CNN. It is apparent that they are hell bent on extracting details of military preparations and targets from the responsible politicians, even where they do not exist. I must acknowledge the restraints exercised by Mr Powell and co. However, in the face of such pressure in front of a wounded population as well as CNN's patriotic hype, policy makers are put in a tight corner. They can also do away with the Hollywood type music and presentation. I congratulate the BBC for its informed and responsible journalism, as always.     The media reporting in this case has been a bit too one-dimensional. They are right about the fact that it was a terrible attack that was devastating in the extreme, but the media fails to address what actually drove those people to do what they did. They hardly mention how American foreign policy has steadily built up a series of enemies amongst the Arab world, they do not mention what the Americans have done in the past to annoy such countries, or what could be done to reconciliate with such countries. I am neither pro-American, nor pro-Arab, just an interested observer      I was not impressed with a GMTV reporter stalking a fireman who had rescued some workers and barely escaped with his life. He had already said he was not a hero, was just doing his job and did not want to be interviewed but he was forced into an interview and was clearly uncomfortable.      Whilst quite possibly being the most important event of the decade so far, the media here in the UK went into complete unnecessary overdrive just as they did with Diana's death. Whilst not denying that it had to be covered in great depth, the constant bulletins, interviews, reports and analysis on most channels just overwhelmed me completely. There was such a thing as too much coverage. You were almost forced to watch the same footage over and over again in some cases. God bless those who died last Tuesday...      The British media in my view has been balanced in reporting events. The BBC has been outstanding in its coverage although I must say that it took nearly an hour for them to show that the towers had collapsed. Why this happened I'm not sure but if it was to hide the human suffering then I must congratulate the BBC.      This disaster has been very well covered but why does everyone forget the thousands of people that the US has been responsible for killing in the name of democracy, the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Vietnam, the thousands of civilians in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia? Why has little mention been made of China's comments calling for calm? Why are we all supporting and rushing to aid firms that have been calling for a major conflict so that they can make their profits.      There has been way too much news coverage attacking every possible angle they could. If this kind of atrocity had happened in a developing country like those in Africa I very much doubt whether we would have been exposed to this degree of coverage.      Premature judgement, ready baked answers to all questions concerning the attack. Early declaration of war against unknown enemy, that's part of what I see in the media coverage of the attack. I can understand politicians rushing to provide the answers, but I expect more from the media, balanced coverage and clear evidence is what the media should follow and not rumours.      I am an American living temporarily in Austria. I see the comparison between CNN-US edition and CNN-Europe edition. It makes me sick to see American media prey on the victims just to receive good ratings, while it seems European news is much more concerned for people's dignity and privacy. I am ashamed how CNN hunts down victims and publicises their accounts and how we try to make a hero out of everyone. Reporters don't care about people, all they care about is their ratings.      It has seemed since the second plane flew into the WTC that war is inevitable and the chief suspect, Bin Laden. I do not in any way support anyone who uses violence to further their cause, but I do feel that Bin Laden and his supporters have been tried and found guilty by the media and many world leaders, although there has been no trial. Is this justice? The media has a huge responsibility to report the whole picture. I get the impression that there are plenty of people around the world who believe that killing and war do not end killing and war, but perpetuate it. But are we hearing their voices? My impression from the media is that a diplomatic solution is seen as impossible. "

It's called the ""power cut"".      One cow says to another: ""Have you heard about mad cow disease?"" The other cow thinks and replies: ""I am not worried - I am a parrot.""      A man is walking down the street with a cabbage attached to a piece of string. His mate bumps into him and says - why have you got a cabbage attached to a piece of string. He replies - It's not a cabbage, it's a cauli!      Easily the best joke in the world is... Why has Edward Woodwood got 4 D's in his name.... Because otherwise he would be called Ewar Woowar...      I thought Monty Python had already completed that research programme and the result was:    My dogs got no nose! How does he smell then? Terrible!      A wife complains, ""Our clock almost killed my mother today. It fell off the wall only seconds after she got up from the couch."" The husband mumbles, ""Damn clock always was slow.""      Did you hear about the dyslexic agnostic insomniac? He used to lie awake at night wondering if there was a dog.      A snail is making his way through the woods when he is mugged by two slugs. He goes to the woodland police station to report the crime and, still in some considerable distress, is interviewed by the duty sergeant (probably a squirrel). In an effort to restore order, the sergeant says ""Please calm down Mr Snail! It's important that you give us as much information as you can about your attackers so they can't do this sort of thing again. Now did you get a good look at their faces?"" The snail replies, ""I'm sorry, I didn't - it all happened so quickly!""      Q: Why is 6 afraid of 7? A: Because 7 8 9.      There were 2 eggs in a frying pan, one says to the other - ""Blimey, it's hot in here"" The other replies - ""Arrgggh! A talking egg""!      I went to the doctor and said, ""I think i'm a pig"" - ""How long have you felt like that?"" he replied...""About three weeeeek weeeek weeeeeks!"" "
HOC HOC-FV -1.66 " With classic, hilarious comedy such as Fawlty Towers, Dad's Army, Yes Minister and Morecambe and Wise being repeated at regular intervals on TV, it can hardly be the viewing public who have lost their sense of humour. Perhaps the next generation of would-be comedians have simply been brainwashed by the American trash which society now expects them to find funny. For all the young British public might understand of John Cleese's satire, they might as well be from Barcelona...      As anybody who has been to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival will testify, British is just as likely to be unfunny as it is brilliant. We can't all be comedians, but if comedy is meant to be safe and scripted, then I fear there would probably be a lot less for everyone to laugh at. I assume that the comedy entry in this debate was that provided by Lori Smith from the wholesome US of A. The clue is in the name. It wasn't called Men Behaving Well for nothing; but come on, x-rated! And to think that there was a serious attempt to have all BBC output shown in the States carry a warning that it had been censored by the British Government, because it wouldn't allow Gerry Adams' voice to be broadcast.      The British sense of humour isn't quite what it used to be. Some of the newer comedies are dire indeed. Shows like ""Absolutely Fabulous"", what crap, what the heck is going on there? The best of British comedy was ""Steptoe and Son"", ""Only Fools and Horses"", ""Only When I Laugh"", ""Last of the Summer Wine"" (not quite as good since Compo died), ""Fawlty Towers"" and ""One Foot in the Grave"". We have let our standards slip since those great series. In saying this though we are still some way ahead of the Americans, I just don't get their sense of humour at all. Try as I might I just don't find their sitcoms funny. Please don't import anymore.      Any nation that can produce a brilliant show like ""Absoultely Fabulous"" has not lost its sense of humour. Looking forward anxiously to the new series!      There's a huge difference between ""innovative and entertaining humour"" and silliness, and I have to say that I agree with JC's opinion in that we have lost our sense of it. I'm all for well constructed, imaginative comedy, the type of which Britain is famous for, and I'm fiercely proud of it. But we really have forgotten how to be silly, and also how good it feels. Now I'm off to an important meeting and I'm going to do a silly walk all the way there.      No, I have not lost my sense of humour. But I understand why it would seem that people are, as we do not see enough comedy now by comedians like John Cleese, I would like to see more. I also feel that new comedy is not the same as the very funny Monty Python style sketches, and I am only 28.      I didn't really appreciate our sense of humour until I moved to the US 16 months ago. I miss it so much. American comedy is incredibly bland and, quite frankly, unfunny. I can't think of any programmes that come close to the likes of The League of Gentlemen or The Fast Show and Eddie Izzard is in a league of his own. John Cleese obviously doesn't know what he's talking about or is it sour grapes perhaps?      I think Ian is right Cleese himself has had to resort to doing crappy westerns which were unfunny. Get back in your box John and leave it to the new kids on the block they're doing okay.      Well I don't think us Brits have ""lost"" our comedy, but we do tend to forget about it! The recent Channel 4 comedy, ""Black Books"" was in my opinion was the best sitcoms I've seen in years, effortlessly funny and brilliantly played by Bill Bailey and Dylan Moran - It won the British comedy award last year, unfortunately, no one seems to have watched it but me and a few friends. Wake up Britain! We're still doing some class comedy!      The British certainly have not lost their sense of humour - I recall evenings with British friends where non-stop hilarity was a constant feature. Sadly, this talent for off-the-cuff humour does not extend to the ranks of the ""professional"" writers whose work is generally of a very poor standard, particularly in sit-com writing. On the odd occasion you find a British comedy episode capable of producing real laughter, you encounter a dozen more total ""duds"". The quality, to put it charitably, is very patchy.      Steve UK - you are right in principle, but wrong on one detail. For new, corking British comedy, before you turn to BBC, turn on Radio 4. Today's Radio 4 is tomorrow's TV Comedy. League Of Gentlemen, The Day Today/Alan Partridge, People Like Us, Chambers, Goodness Gracious Me and many more flourished on radio 4 before migrating to TV.      For my money the only show that consistently makes me laugh out loud is the American show, Frasier. It feels like an English show anyway with at least two cast members born in England and the central characters are far more sophisticated than the usual U.S. sitcom characters.      I don't think the British have lost their sense of humour, we are after all renowned around the world for our sarcasm and satire. I do however think that we are probably less silly because we are so busy taking ourselves seriously. Everything revolves around being composed and dignified (perhaps trying to emulate how we see ourselves in business?). We are very image conscious and I think that this reflects itself in our reluctance to let ourselves go.      Cleese is just a comedy fossil, who can't understand that the world has changed. There's a lot of sophisticated humour out there, which people have already mentioned, and there's silliness too (anyone remember the naked Riverdance on Comic Relief?). But this isn't the 1970's. I personally find Fawlty Towers tired and overdone, but I'm sure it was great in its time.      You will find that we do still have fantastic comedies in this country. The League of Gentlemen, for example, was outstanding new comedy! It is there, you just have to look for it. For some reason it is hidden away on BBC2. Switch off those bloody awful depressing soaps and watch the corking BRITISH comedy that is there!!      In the UK the best examples of humour are what one comes across in everyday life, not on TV. You're guaranteed a much better laugh from eavesdropping on old ladies' conversations on the bus than watching overrated tosh like 'League of Gentlemen'. On the subject of TV comedy, the only true comic genius of the last 20 years is Ali G/Borat, who can guarantee more belly laughs in one show than Vic and Bob could in a whole career.      Just do not stop comedy on any level. We are bored with N. American so-called comedy.      There is one thing that is diminishing our sense of humour - political correctness. This is being filtered down from the high reaches of our current government and they are not exactly a bundle of laughs, are they?      Lost our sense of humour - never I say. But, post Mary Whitehouse, TV has been a bit puerile and desensitised, with budgets wasted on ""fly on the wall"" shows instead of financing real talent for real entertainment. It must be time for The Ministry of Silly TV, before memories of crying with laughter at the Monty Python, Del Boy et al remain just memories with no new additions. A future where humour on TV remains bad remakes of Some Mothers Do 'ave 'em starring Lee Evans (why, oh why?) doesn't look promising.      Humour is an intensely personal, subjective matter, so I think Mat Allen is completely wrong! The only quality comedy programmes on TV at the moment are Frasier. I have seen nothing that is home produced that is worthy of five minutes viewing. Most of the characters are drawn as slobbish or amoral. I almost lived in the comedy clubs of Edinburgh for years and at the Fringe. But I think the basis of humour has changed dramatically, and political correctness, and a massively changed set of values from one generation to the next, are mostly to blame.      How much of Monty Python would be permitted these days? The ""100m freestyle for non-swimmers"" (where everyone drowned), the ""100m sprint for those with no sense of direction"", the Dead Parrot sketch etc. When people lose the ability to laugh at themselves everyone suffers.      British humour can't stay still forever, it has to change with the times. One of the best examples of this is the Red Dwarf TV show. And nothing like it has been done outside of the UK. Looking forward to its big screen debut next spring!      I never knew the British had a sense of humour to begin with. Despite the fact that we Germans are told not to laugh - even we have more humour.      No, I find the British sense of humour very appealing. Most of my British friends have a very sarcastic sense of humour, which is very appealing to me and my American cohorts. My British friends are infinitely amusing, maybe John Cleese has just lost his touch. He should go back to making fun of the French.      I suspect Cleese is putting his mouth where the money is. He's astute. Unfunny, but astute.      I don't think the British people are losing their sense of humour- only the TV makers are! Subtle wit is vanishing rapidly on the screen - but live in a foreign country and you will be gaspingfor a British laugh I assure you!      The comments of people like Lori Smith, USA, prove that in some respect, the USA still lag behind in the humour department. And then, like so much of their output, their comedy can be funny, albeit very manufactured and unnatural. Shows like Gimme Gimme Gimme or the Office for example, are both brilliant, but so different, and that's the strength of British humour. What's on after the perishing Friends these days? Will and Grace, which seems to be filmed in the same studio with different actors and the same gag writers. And a country where George W. can be president definitely hasn't got a sense of humour.      Lost our sense of humour? Are you mad Cleese?! Seriously though, I don't think the Beeb has the necessary funds these days to generate shows of the calibre it has made in the past. Production costs have increased geometrically, whilst the licence fee has increased in a more linear fashion. Even so, The Office [BBC2, Mon, 21.30] is absolutely hilarious!      I think that John Cleese - a well-known believer in the curative effects of psychoanalysis - may be ""projecting"" when he says the UK is no longer funny. He may not have been funny since the late 70's but plenty of other British people are.      I cannot understand those heralding America as the last bastion of humour. Frasier, Cheers and all the witless dross that followed are fine if your tastes run to safe, gentle, mildly annoying middlebrow entertainment but they are as nothing compared to the inventive and often groundbreaking comedies of Radio 4 and BBC2 and Channel 4. The recent Brass Eye and all of Ali G are shows that could never ever be shown on American TV (even the much feted Showtime or HBO). If you think the UK is bad, come and sample the po faced, relentlessly right on, ""irony-free zone"" in the US. Go on if you think you're hard enough.      British humour took a turn for the worse several years ago and has been in a steady decline since. The reason for this is a simple but important one. British humour always carried either a sense of the ridiculous about it or it had an innocence which no other country could convey as well as us. The decline began when swearing became common place in our comedy. Just look back at what made us laugh at Steptoe & son, Porridge, George & Mildred, Rising Damp etc. All these comedies skirted around the silly and rude humour without saying the words that made these programmes more endearing and funny. The innocence has gone and with it, our unique, enviable style of humour.      Just a quick look through the Radio Times shows that the vast majority of the ""comedy"" is from America (excluding Australian soaps of course which are only hilarious by accident) with all the canned laughter and insane screaming whenever a new character turns up on set. There is still good comedy out there but as the best involves you switching off the TV, turning on the radio and using your imagination I guess it will be lost on the average Friends fan.      How can Cleese claim a lack of ""silliness"" from Britian when we have stand-ups like Eddie Izzard and TV shows such Vic & Bob and Trigger Happy TV, as well as many more. It seems that this, once comedy genius, is merely drawing further attention to his demise which was already apparent after films such as Splitting Heirs and Clockwise.      I suggest that the pompous Cleese just now believes his own publicity. I was turned off him years back when he did those completely unfunny broadcasts for the SDP/Lib Alliance...      Go watch Brass Eye, then be quiet John!      The British sense of humour is fine and flourishing, it's just that the stuff on the television doesn't actually represent/reflect it any more. Television is increasingly safe, boring and predictable.      Satire is now greeted with howls of righteous indignation. Humour has given way to priggishness. Those who enjoyed mocking the establishment in the sixties now find it hard to be mocked.      John Cleese's comments about our sense of humour were wrong. His comments about our media were spot on. With the exception of Radio 4, for example, British radio is the most unimaginative in the world, filled with vacuous programming, and offering no outlets for writing - comedy or otherwise.      After living in Sweden for over 30 months, I can safely say that in comparison to the Swedes we definitely have a sense of humour.      I don't think that we British have lost our sense of humour; it has just become more diversified. People who like Last of the Summer Wine or Dinner Ladies, probably don't like The Office or Spaced. This means there's no sitcom that the whole family tunes in to watch on a Saturday night, as used to happen with Morecambe and Wise or The Two Ronnies. My solution to this would be an episode of Last of the Summer Wine where Clegg discovers that his long lost son is Ali G and the Slough Massive turn up to bust some rhymes with Nora Batty.      I think Rowan Atkinson is one of the most talented comedians of his generation. Just to get off the track a little though - I thought British sitcom humour exceeded the intelligence of American humour until I saw ""Men Behaving Badly"". Don't you people have censors? That show should practically be X-rated. It makes me sick.      We have not lost our sense of humour. Our ability to laugh at ourselves and our sense of irony are still a wonder to the rest of the world - let's keep it like that!      What John Cleese doesn't seem to understand is that people's tastes in comedy have changed and developed over the past 30 years, and they want more from their comedy than perhaps he himself can offer. Nostalgia always seems to make us look back at things with misty eyes, and the comedy shows of the past are no exception, but similar to then, there is some great - and not so great - comedy out there at the moment. The brilliant ""Spaced"" with Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson is one of the best shows I think I have had the pleasure of watching.      I like the English humour. I agree it is different from ours and it takes me a little bit to catch on. I would like more English TV shows on the air here. I love Are You Being Served - I know it is old but it will always be funny to me.      I love to watch the Britcoms on Sunday night. Keeping Up Appearances is the greatest show ever made. I laugh out loud several times during each showing. More please.      I think the only reason the British sense of humour is suffering is the baffling trend of comedy writers trying to emulate popular US shows such as Friends and other awful sitcoms. Once the trend is over, and originality restored, things will be back on track.      I find these 'comedies' (Bottom, League of Gentlemen, Men Behaving Badly) unfunny and childish, but that's my personal taste. I find there is a marked lack of anything intelligently funny, which is filled somewhat by American cartoons such as The Simpsons and South Park. Can humans not deliver such topical wit?      To generalise, as the decline of British influence has become apparent, most Brits have taken themselves way too seriously, while tending to wallow in self-righteous importance. British writers and playwrights merely reflect this, as does the incessant and obsessive carping directed at the US as it has usurped the UK. However, many in the US find your obsessive, childish and self-indulgent prattling amusing, so perhaps there is hope. After all, John Cleese's Monty Python was best when it was poking fun at British arrogance and pseudo-superiority.      British comedy is alive and kicking. As a Brit living in Germany it's the thing I miss the most. The League of Gentlemen/The Royle Family are pure genius. Not to mention AbFab, Gimme,Gimme the list goes on. And guess what, a lot of my German friends out here even get it! Or are they now required to laugh by a new EU directive?      The reason we're so good at humour (and are thought to be worldwide), is that we're rather messed-up psychologically compared with the rest of the world. The British have a closer intuitive understanding of the human mind than in most other cultures - this introspection has arisen partly because of a legacy of repression from the past. Laughter is how we survive, and how we express the craziness that we see in ourselves and around us. The new generation of comedians are great, though they don't use it as an art form as much as people did in the '70s, when John Cleese was funny.      Please don't say it is true! I have been raised with the classics...Monty Python, Black Adder, The Young Ones...they are all part of the reason I am moving to the UK. Don't tell me now you have lost it, I have brought my tickets and everything!      I don't think there is that much difference between the senses of humour across Europe except that for some reason my German and Swiss friends think John Cleese is hilarious - and I don't      I think there may be something in Cleese's theory, but I must take issue with Tom of Australia when he says that American humour is superior - if the over-hyped laugh-free ""Will & Grace"" is an example of how much ""better"" US sitcoms are, there is no hope.      Modern humour seems to consist of shouting loudly, using four-letter words and belittling anything or anyone. Sorry, but I'd rather stick to comedy from a different age. Even the ""Carry On"" series were better than some of the filth masquerading as humour that is currently on the screens. Give me a dead parrot any day!      Of course the British haven't lost their sense of humour, Spike Milligan is still alive.      Humour is in a constant state of evolvement and has moved on from silly to other directions. Sure it hits a lull now and then waiting for great comedians to come along BUT British humour is still the epitome of humour when compared to any other country.      British humour is the one thing I really miss while living overseas. I do have friends in the UK that send comedy videos regularly and these are then distributed in HK. Also the lack of available funny/entertaining TV means you tend to go to see more live comedians perform, and from what I've seen recently the Brits still kick butt & take names when it comes to humour. Comedy should have no boundaries.      Well, everyone has a different sense of humour and this changes over time. Most people these days don't find unsophisticated, slapstick or sexist/racist humour as funny as in the 70s for instance. Shows like ""Yes Minister"", ""Frasier"" or ""The Royle Family"" evince a cleverer and more subtle brand of humour, which can still have you in stitches in much the same way as ""Fawlty Towers"". Like pop music, humour changes with time, and maybe John Cleese is sounding like the comedic equivalent of a rock dinosaur.      For once I have to disagree with John Cleese. The humour is still around although new comedy is undoubtedly put through the PC police before we get to see it as TV producers would rather have a rating winner than a cult sensation. Of course the League of Gentlemen and other series do occasionally get through to amuse us. All we are seeing at the moment is the end result of the early 80's alternative scene, in which traditional humour targets were frowned upon and replaced by ""jokes"" about politicians and sex.      Hopefully we'll soon be rid of the days when someone generates a laugh by simply shouting the rudest word they can recall from their schooldays at an audience. We can then rediscover the subjects that genuinely make us laugh - PC or not!      People have changed in Britain. We are fast becoming more active in work. More and more people are staying later and later at work. When people do watch television, there is now such as vast choice of sport and films to watch that sitcoms and comedies are not attracting the audience they once did. British people still appreciate comedy and sitcoms, but not how previous generations did. We haven't lost our sense of humour, we still appreciate the same comedy, everyone loves that ""Mrs Richards"" scene from Fawlty Towers and people love the classic ""Only Fools and Horses"". Just people in general tend to watch other programmes more. Particularly since, a host of DIY, soaps, Watchdog"" type and many game shows have risen in both standard and popularity.      Of course Brit humour is still as sardonic, cutting, self-deprecating and xenophobic as it ever was; Cleese shouldn't worry. Perhaps it's he who's lost the plot with all his US style psycho-drivel. But as for martin, UK, and his comments about not knowing what Canadian humour is like, well Marty, it's nothing like American humour: check out ""Kids in the Hall"" or ""Cod Co"" or ""This hour has 22 minutes"" to see the irony, self-deprecation and cutting parody only a small nation is capable of when confronted by an overfed, greedy neighbour. Think of Scots' humour, but without the Calvinist bitterness.      No I don't think that the British sense of humour has been lost. Most Australians appreciate what makes the Poms laugh. The problem is that we don't get enough of British comedians on our TV stations, which tend to favour American sitcom, which is also appreciated here. I think that the British humour is part and parcel of living in Britain, it will always be there.      Yes Ian - I agree. He doesn't make me laugh anymore - we've seen it all before - he does the same act, pulls the same faces. The second offering of a fish called Wanda - was very second rate and amateur. The Monty Python team was unique and are still wonderfully hilarious - they had their finger on the pulse of society, but now Cleese still has the perplexed fast talking manner, shouting at the world act he had 25yrs ago he is still in the 70s, Eric Idle does sit-coms, Palin is in comfortable documentary land.      Of course we haven't lost our sense of humour its moved on and if he had to do the work of a stand up comic trying to make his mark - he might get in to contact with what is making us laugh now. Sour grapes it seems      Yes simply because of the fast pace of life and keeping up with the Joneses.      How can the US and Australia even consider mocking the British sense of humour? The US with their now infamous ""irony bypass"" surgery performed at birth keep churning out the same rubbish night after night, the entire plot of every US sitcom could be written on a stamp and still have room for the canned laughter. As for the Australians? When was the last comedy that came out of Australia? Pushing aside Rolf Harris and Dame Edna who darkened our screens the only programmes I find funny are Neighbours and other laughable soaps. C'mon US and Australia, have an original idea of your own please? By the way, this is British humour - it's called sarcasm.      For your information, you will find that the USA often take comedy from Britain and bastardise it for their market. Till death do us part is Archy Bunker. Steptoe and Son is Stamford and Son, Ab Fab is Sybil, Dear John is Dear John To name but a few. I still think British humour is the best. One Foot in the Grave is one of my favourites. And for those 'Friends' lovers, what about 'Cold Feet'? I think Mr. Cleese was just being silly.      What is John Cleese on about - the prime-time output of BBC1 and ITV is absolutely laughable.      The country has had a rough trot recently with foot-and-mouth, mad cow disease, racial tension and our continuing sporting woes. However it's often out of such adversity that comedy thrives. I rate Eddie Izzard as the greatest of them all and the characters in The Fast Show could only originate from British comedy geniuses such as Paul Whitehouse, Charlie Higson, Simon Day etc.      As an Englishman living in the USA for over 15 years, I was delighted to discover such shows as League of Gentlemen, Alan Partridge, The Royle Family etc on BBC America. I can assure you these shows are welcome relief from the bland, offenseless ( and consequently boring) formula sitcoms churned out on network TV here...no, the English have not lost their sense of humour at all!      Lost our sense of silliness? What's the man on about? Has he not seen So Graham Norton?      I still find the funny walk hilarious. I also love the mickey taking of the Germans which is as true today as it was when he didn't mention the war! The English are excellent at finding humour in our foreign friends. Any joke that starts with an Irishman, a Scotsman etc, is usually not PC and all the better for it.      Whole swathes of our humour are being ditched because of political correctness. I suspect the politically correct will stifle humour altogether.      What about Chris Morris, Simon Pegg, Chris Moyles? There are hundreds of very funny new young comedians making ""me"" laugh. I'd go so far as to say that some of the current generation are comedy geniuses!      Yes, I think so. In real life the Brits are as caught up with succeeding in the corporate world and sports world as anyone else. As for TV sitcoms, the US leaves Britain for dead now - the British are boring.      You just need to look at the rubbish that passes for humour on TV these days to know where the problem is. We are inundated with what can only be called vulgar, overbearing idiots who think the only way to raise a laugh is to belittle someone else in a way that the rest of us left behind on the primary school playground. Whoever said TV wasn't dumbing down was obviously not bothering to watch it.      English cricket may be a very sad thing these days, but English comedy and drama are alive, kicking and leading the world. In Australia we get bombarded by constant a procession of bland, formula American comedy and drama on our TV and cinema screens. The little relief we get comes from the excellent product we see from the UK. You have the knack. John Cleese used to have it, but unfortunately lost it some time ago.      I have lived in America for the past 12 years and I still look forward to Thursday night where I sit laughing at such comedies as ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and ""Are you Being Served"" . They are old ones, but nothing beats our sense of humour.      Blackadder, Fast Show, League of Gentlemen, French & Saunders, The Day Today, Ali G, Royle Family .... amongst the most innovative and ground breaking comedy shows of the past 20 years. If only we could keep this level of consistency we'd be laughing ...      Harry Hill, League of Gentlemen, Trigger Happy TV, Brass Eye, and Alan Partridge etc etc - we produce the funniest comedies in the world bar none - nothing has changed.      We have plenty of funny British comedy, though maybe not an older person's cup of tea - comedy like Bottom, Game On, Men Behaving Badly. I'm not sure what Canadian comedy's like, but if it's anything like America's then what are they talking about? I find American comedy very simple. I appreciate comedy that makes you laugh about what they say rather than how they say it.      In certain aspects, such as sitcoms, yes, I think the quality of comedy has reduced, but British stand-up is as strong as ever, with Eddie Izzard, Lee Evans and Ed Burns leading the way.      Whenever I went abroad for long periods, wherever I went, I always missed one thing more than anything else - the British sense of humour. We find lots of things funny but our sense of humour is evolving all the time and taking on different genres. I loved Fawlty Towers, could never see what was funny about Benny Hill, didn't really get Vic and Bob, and find League of Gentlemen hilarious but I wouldn't expect everyone to feel the same. Variety is the spice of life and we do it better than anyone else.      The trouble with Messrs Cleese and Co is that they're trying to find something as good as or better than their previous efforts. They try too hard TRYING to be funny. Just give it up and leave it to the young.      Has Mr Cleese not seen The League of Gentlemen?      Having seen much of John Cleese's recent artistic output I have to say that I don't think it's us who are losing our sense of humour ......     It is not a lack of humour that we are suffering from but an increasing intolerance for ""mucking about"". People will not tolerate practical jokes and general silly behaviour as they see it as threatening yobbish behaviour - especially the police.      I agree with Candide - humour often served as a way of making a point without having to be so negative. Today, the media is generally quite destructive in its Brit bashing. And humour can also be pointless surely? Maybe we just can't make time in our busy lives for a bit of pointless fun any more. Of course it is a subjective matter as to what is funny. Who would have thought Benny Hill was funny? The French for a start.      I don't think there's any doubt that British humour is not what it was. Recent polls seem to indicate that the funniest moments in UK TV shows are over twenty years old. They just don't make programmes like ""Dad's Army"" or ""Yes Minister"" any more. Tonight here in Australia I watched Lee Evans trying to copy Michael Crawford's Frank Spencer. There's just no comparison.      I think it's Mr Cleese who's lost his sense of humour. You're only as good as your last film, and 'Fierce Creatures' was appalling. I think the current batch of UK humour is the best in the world. League of Gentlemen, The Office, Phoenix Nights et al are excellent. Not the unoriginal, samey formulaic rubbish we are bombarded with from across the Atlantic. Do we need acceptance from abroad to be good?      Writing and producing comedy is a bit like cooking pasta ""al dente"". Many comedy series and their performers are funny and fresh at the outset, but they inevitably get soggy. Others never get past the raw uncooked stage. John Cleese has got soggy, comedy-wise, but he's a bright boy and he doesn't need to play the clown forever. Grow up John, and leave the clowning to the new generation of pasta performers. The League of Gentlemen, for example, is excellent, but who can say whether it will prove to be a timeless comedy masterpiece like ""Fawlty Towers""?      No, I think British humour is just as strong and funny as it was 10, 20 or even 30 years ago. Go to many comedy clubs and shows and you will find genuine performances that will have you in tears. Where things seem to have been lost is on TV and sitcom writing especially. I think the only decent example in the last 5 years I can think of is ""Dinner Ladies"", and that stressed Victoria Wood out so much writing it, that there sadly won't be any more.      Of course we're not losing our sense of humour. Look at who's Prime Minister and look at the two contenders for the leadership of the Conservative Party. The leader of the Liberals is Charles Kennedy, the well-known guest on ""Have I Got News For You"".      I doubt the sense of humour has been lost. It has merely gone into hibernation, awaiting the likes of Messrs Elton, Cleese, and Mayall's next offerings. They have a moral obligation to those of us not umbilically connected to the diet of tripe currently on offer, to produce further Blackadders/Bottoms/Fawltys in order to help save our sanity. If I have to watch Ali G again I fear I may lose the plot altogether.      I don't think the British have lost their sense of humour, perhaps they have just stopped finding John Cleese funny? "
HOC HOC-JD -1.73 " I was born a sceptic. Only a recent interest has brought Dylan's depth and talent to my CD collection. Only now does my collection seem complete. He offers himself to be either loved or hated, but he never shifts to the fickle fads of fleeting fancy. A born artist, not a manufactured money-spinner.      Bob Dylan is the opiate of the pseudo-intellectuals.      Bob Dylan composed music and wrote lyrics to many memorable songs. But he never wrote any computer software or got rich selling overpriced computer or communications gadgets. So who cares about Bob Dylan in the year 2001?      I must say I never did understand a lot of Bob's lyrics. However it is the way that they are delivered and arranged that makes him the greatest ever. I also think we sometimes overlook the masses of hits that other artists have had with his songs..none, I must say, as good as the original. Bob Dylan could make a song about doing the dishes sound brilliant.      The lyrics of Dylan's early songs were the conscience of a generation. So may of the freedoms and human rights that we take for granted today simply did not exist in the early/mid sixties. Dylan's songs such as 'Blowing in the Wind', The Time are Changing', 'Ballad of Hattie Carol', 'Hollis Brow' etc highlighted the social inequalities of the times, and encouraged a young generation to do something about them. Not only is he a wonderful musician, but a great social reformer      Although a prolific songwriter, I can see no valid reason why he should be voted the best ever, that is rubbish, pure sentimental rubbish      I feel very fortunate that I have lived in the time of Dylan. I was sixteen when first I encountered him and every song and poem was and remains like a jewel. That he is still alive and well, still writing and performing is a great gift to all of us. Thank you Bob for all the years of great music. Happy Birthday.      Don't know. Is there a legacy? Neither me or my friends ever listened to Dylan, but we were hugely impressed by Hendrix's version of ""All along the watchtower"" when it came out. I think he is as overrated as U2 and Sting. Big names, huge sales, but mediocre music. Can't say anything about the lyrics.      He is a symbol of a generation - lie back, don't be ""negative"", accumulate heaps of cash telling people what they want to hear and let your grandchildren clear up the mess you made of the world while you were making up songs blaming everybody else - show the world that, with slick marketing you can sell anybody as a singer and intellectual - thank God the 60s have gone, I just wish the apologists for that era of selfishness would retire!      Only Paul Simon comes close to drawing any suitable comparisons with the man.      His reputation, people say, is his really good lyrics. Problem is his singing is so bad it's too much effort to take note of what it is he's wailing about. He can strum like a good 'un though.      You can't argue with Dylan. HE does the writing, the playing, the arranging...the whole interpretation. If you say you don't like his singing, well then you reject expressionism. If you say you don't like his lyrics, you're ignoring brilliant phrasing. You simply cannot be considered a serious music fan and not be awed by him. He's the best, it's not even close really.      Whichever mood I am in, there is a Bob Dylan song that I find myself in. And I do not mean only in terms of lyrics, but also in terms of music. What makes him even more admirable is the fact that he found time to devote for making life of humanity better by being an activist.      I'm sure that Mr. Dylan is an example of that even if you can't sing, can't play any instrument and if you write something just remotely related to true poetry, but with the assistance from so-called rock-critics (99% of whom don't have music education or any proper education) and biased journalists and doing all the stuff in the right time you can become a legend. At times, it's just sad that such ""artists"" are being revered for producing nothing of significance either musically or lyrically.      His lyrics say more than any other songwriter's can and the feeling he puts into singing them would send shivers down anyone's spine. As I once read somewhere, ""Dylan on a bad day outclasses most other musicians' masterpieces"" - ""And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burnin' coal Pourin' off of every page Like it was written in my soul from me to you, Tangled up in blue.""      It's hard to calculate quite how much Dylan has given music and poetry. But, for me, growing up in the 80's with the shallow trash that was chart music, I delved into my parents' record collection and discovered their Dylan record. I've been a fan ever since - no one touches his songwriting, or singing for that matter!      His legacy - simple, that you can look like a real muppet and still be called ""the best ever""!!      Before Bob Dylan came along rock & roll was stuck in its adolescent hand-holding phase. He showed a generation of performers, writers and fans that rock & roll could grow up.      With Dylan, many people have trouble separating the artist from the work. That is to say, the legacy becomes confused with the ongoing additions to it. Dylan's voice understandably grates on a great many people. Having said that, even detractors must admit that he has expanded the range of possibilities in popular music in terms of musical and lyrical content and, yes, in terms of what kind of vocal delivery is appropriate.      Musical appreciation is a matter of personal taste. Myself, I don't particularly like Dylan's stuff, and I don't even like the Beatles! However, I'm prepared to believe that there are others out there with views different to mine. Personally, I think Bono of U2 took rock to a new level, and Bowie can never be beaten!      Bob is good, but no more than a raw poet who can hang his words to a few simple melodies and the same four chords. Lennon and McCartney, (partly due to being European) can claim the prize for turning popular music into an art form. People should also remember that songwriting is about also about music and how words and music provide for each other. In this respect McCartney is the greatest songwriter and along with Lennon has influenced popular music the most.      In the year 2041, who will our children be celebrating? Certainly not the collection of manufactured no-talent individuals of today!      The distinction needs to be made: Dylan was (is) a writer of great songs rather than a great songwriter: neither songwriting per se nor musicianship has ever been his top priority. What he is, beyond any doubt at all, is a truly great poet. I will happily contend that his poetry is among the finest the last sixty years has to offer. Long may he continue.      You can split the population of the world into two separate flocks, those who get Bob and those who don't, and it's those who don't who we should pity. You've gotta open up your minds and feel his Bobness in action, it's all about his phrasing and his amazing voice. I'm a believer, he needs to be rediscovered by the young 'uns, he's still the Daddy. I'm only 18, original fans are in their 60's, and no other artist has such a wide appeal.      What separates Dylan from other songwriters is the sheer magnitude of his songbook and the fact that the quality of the songs sustains such a high standard from beginning to end.      When the history of 20th century popular music comes to be written from a perspective more distant than ours, two figures will stand out, to whom all the others will be seen as footnotes of greater or lesser import: Sinatra will be one and Dylan will be the other.      Bob Dylan may be allegedly the greatest songwriter ever, but he's certainly lacking on the performance front. David Bowie knocks him into a cocked hat any day of the week for sheer musical skill, showmanship and flair. In another poll done by Virgin.Net, Dylan ranks a poor fifth when it comes to naming the greatest rockers ever, so I guess it depends on the criteria you use. Personally, Dylan bores me rigid with his self-indulgent lyrical apathy.      Bob Dylan without a doubt can be considered the greatest songwriter of our time. Until his debut, songs were very simplistic, usually about girls, romance, cars, dancing or any combination thereof. Dylan brought serious social issues and concerns into music. He mixed cutting commentary with sarcasm, humour, and plaintive pleas for introspection. He questioned human follies, the hypocrisy of politics, the tragedy of war, often mixing diverse musical styles from ballads, rock, folk, country, gospel and roots music. It was a potent combination that influenced countless musicians and songwriters. Happy Birthday Bob!      The clich?d answer is that by marrying electric guitar with serious lyrics he invented modern rock. True as this is, for me though it's just the power and beauty of his own lyrics that stand as his greatest legacy.      Wasn't he on the Magic Roundabout??      Hey, come on, this guy is just the best. He's been around forever somewhere out there. My favourites - Boots of Spanish Leather; Highway 61; Positively 4th Street and the all time great - One Too Many Mornings. Pure joy, pure magic, where do I stop? Everyone has their own favourites, there are so many.      The greatest??? The man can't sing, insists on using a mouth organ at every opportunity with the objective presumably being to make the foulest, most unpleasant noise possible!!! And most importantly what is going on with his hair???      Give me Abba any day. The BBs wrote great songs and the AAs performed them perfectly.      As a musician myself, I figure I have some qualification to state that Bob Dylan is one of the greatest, most talented people to ever come out of the music scene in the United States. People may think that Bob is a horrible singer, but in actuality he is one of the best, most original that ever lived. Sure it sounds harsh to people, but his skill at improvising is second to no one on earth, and that includes his phrasing as well.      Since 1964 I have really needed no other music - the Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, Sinatra, Madonna et al just pass alongside. Happy birthday and thank God for Dylan!      Listen to Nina Simone cover ""Just Like a Woman"" and you can understand Dylan's skill at expressing complex emotions inside relationships. Bowie and the Beatles never achieved this.      Bob Dylan could do three things: write lyrics, play a musical instrument and create classic tunes; something that the present generation of so-called pop stars palpably fail to do.      Bob Dylan is one of the most influential singer/songwriters of all time, that goes without saying. As for greatest lyricist ever...I'd give that title to Lennon. Without a doubt, the Beatles have done the most to influence popular music today.      Whether Dylan is the 'greatest' songwriter of all time depends on individual preference, as is shown in the range of comments. What is not debatable, is the fact that Dylan and artists like him, really 'felt' their music. They believed in what they were writing and they were trying to change things. I just wish that there could be a resurgence of this in today's popular music so that we could be saved from the manufactured, cheap, monotonous works of stupidity that are drummed out by Steps, Westlife etc. etc.      Bob Dylan is simply the greatest thing since the invention of French Toast. "
HOC HOC-JI -1.93 " I was once caught by my managing director wandering around our company's basement, with a large cardboard box on my head, pretending to be Dalek shouting 'Exterminate! Exterminate!' Does that count as a blunder? He never took me seriously again after that...      I found myself having a cup of coffee with my supervisor when a very attractive woman walked by. I made a low growl and remarked how great it would be to, well, get to know her better. It was his daughter.      Some of these 'blunders' described here are actually very dangerous and if the right (or wrong) person saw them and decided to do something about it, they could track the confessor down and take serious action against then! Beware.      Mine was a blunder that could have cost me my job. A friend and I had been e-mailing each other about how much we hated my boss. I listed all kinds of rude remarks about him. Somehow I managed to accidentally forward the mail to the boss concerned. Fortunately I realised my mistake as it disappeared from my screen and I was able to sprint upstairs to the server room and catch it as it passed through the mail system about 30 seconds later! I had never gone up stairs four-at-a-time until then....      My worse blunder - it still makes me wake up in the night in a cold sweat - turning down the chance to register a selection of .com domains in 1997 - one of which was subsequently sold for $2 Million Dollars six months later.      This wasn't me, but a friend of mine. He worked for a company that processed geological survey data for oil prospecting and one day managed to erase a computer tape containing results from a recent survey expedition. I think he just put the blank tape back in the rack and hoped no one would notice. (You know who you are, Gavin!)      My biggest work blunder was throwing away what I thought was an empty envelope after cashing up the tills. Unfortunately the envelope contained #500 in #50 notes which was noticed the next day when my boss checked the figures, too late as the rubbish had gone.      I used to have an evening job in a cafe in a leisure centre where we sold soft drinks through a dispenser on a counter. The drink is made from a highly concentrated syrup fed through pipes from the cellar and mixed with carbonated water as it comes out of the dispenser. We were really busy and ran out of coke so I ran downstairs to the cellar, took off the empty coke box and attached a new one. When I got back upstairs we couldn't pull the coke through so I went back down to discover that in my haste I had attached the coke to the lemonade pipe which had been left unattached after the last box of lemonade syrup was finished.      Imagine this. You are deputy Prime Minister of the UK during an election campaign when a protester throws an egg at you. Do you i) act with the dignity and restraint that befits your high public office or ii) turn round and smack him in the gob? Guess which I chose! Dohhhhhhh. . .      I worked at a DIY store as a student and apart from the many 'blunders' that were arranged on purpose to alleviate a boring shift (e.g. deliberately cutting the bottom of a 50kg cement bag so it split over whoever picked it up) there was one that I still cringe about to this day. A half-empty tin of white gloss paint had to be put into the skip at the back of the store. I took it out, but as it was cold, decided to throw the tin into the open-top skip about 10 yards from where I stood. Unfortunately, the skip was not of the open-top variety. The tin rolled off the top of the skip and exploded on the ground showering the managers new car with white gloss paint. It cost be half a day's pay in car wash bills.      My worst blunder was sending an e-mail about my boss to my partner saying that he was bad tempered and difficult to work with. I had written it in Spanish but my boss not only read my personal e-mail, he also had the e-mail translated. Suffice to say I left the company very soon after as I could not work with someone who invaded my privacy like that. However it is a warning to everyone - it doesn't matter how private you think your e-mail is - the boss will read it even in another language - what happened to trust? Anyway it taught me a big lesson!      Not mine, but our loading bay staff managed to leave #0.5 million of highly sensitive computing backup equipment outside a door they said they couldn't get through. This was then compounded by forgetting about it and leaving it there for a week in sub-zero temperatures. Oops!      My second worst blunder was ticking the 'overtime' box (#35/h) instead of the '24x7 standby' box (#4/h) thereby inflating my monthly pay packet by #7,500. My biggest ever blunder was telling my boss, who told me that I was a mug and should keep quiet in future.      It wasn't my blunder, but I made the most of it... I joined a company (which I have since left, thankfully) and asked the payroll department for my salary details so that I could arrange a mortgage. The lady e-mailed me with the salary details. However, my e-mail inbox said that this message had an attachment, which I couldn't find. I eventually double-clicked on the salary details part of the message - and up came a spreadsheet containing everyone's current salary and bonus allowance, and how much they were to be given in the upcoming salary review! I saw that some senior people were getting considerably less than more junior people, and that the unpopular MD had written some comments on the spreadsheet that were less than complimentary about most of his employees. I got a new job, resigned a week or so later, took the spreadsheet with me and e-mailed it to every employee of the (small) company from an anonymous hotmail address.      A colleague was called out at midnight to fix a fail in a computer run of an application that ran the factory we work for and deleted the full application by hitting the D(elete) key on his computer keyboard instead of the S(elect). Luckily we have back up copies of every file so he did manage to recover everything but it was a frightening experience seeing years of work disappear by pressing in a split second.      Whilst enjoying some 'horse play' with several others in our open plan office, I decided to throw a protractor at a colleague. It missed him but continued to sail in a graceful arc like a boomerang until it slammed right into the middle of my boss' face, breaking his glasses and earning me a written warning.      I once interviewed the redoubtable Raquel Welch by telephone for the magazine where I work. After opening with a couple of facetious ice-breaking remarks that only made things frostier, I decided to get on with the interview and nearly hung up on her as I wrestled with the intercom system on my telephone. She couldn't hear me; I could hear her, sighing impatiently as she waited for me to return to the line. Things worked out well in the end, but those were a trying 30 seconds that almost cost the magazine a valuable feature article.      My worst blunder was sending a fax to the CEO of a client company which set out the salary and benefit details for him and the CFO. Both had come from the US parent company to sort out the ailing UK business. Unfortunately I sent the fax to the wrong number within the business and eventually all the UK employees got to see how much the two were being paid. Let's just say the disparity between these two and the rest of the UK team was embarrassingly wide.     I once lost over #1 million worth of communications equipment in the post from the US. Thing is the company didn't even notice which just goes to show that they're far more interested in stopping people claiming a few more pounds on their expenses than auditing what's going on in the company as a whole - Typical.      Well, it seems there aren't that many prepared to admit to blunders. I myself have blundered through jobs and life with a recklessness that could be compared to this man's error. However, you only learn by your mistakes and it will very frequently be the management's error which enabled a mistake of such magnitude to occur on trading books. So TAKE HEART whoever you are - go for business on your own grounds where management will not fail and then renounce you!      I don't make blunders...      Um... getting caught posting messages to the BBC News Talking Point Website? Fortunately my employer is relaxed about internet usage - within reasonable bounds. So the other blunder will have to be talking in less than glowing terms about a former schoolmate who shared the same unusual surname as a co-worker in my office. I don't think I need explain what happened next...      I know of a staffer at a Senator's office in Washington who had something of a crush on the Senator and, to make her boyfriend jealous, decided to fax him, on official headed paper, describing all the things she wanted to do to the Senator. Not knowing how to use the fax machine, she naturally pressed the button that said ""press"". Her fax went to every newspaper and TV station in the state.      I committed my worst blunder by joining the company that I work for at present.      I once accidentally deleted three years of archived data from a database. I was rather embarrassed by this blunder, but not as embarrassed as our database support team were when they tried to recover the lost data from the backup tapes: and found that all the backups made since the last software upgrade three months before were corrupt and unrecoverable. They made sure they verified all the backups after that.      I used to drive tanks in the army. In the wide, open desert with absolutely no obstacles I fell asleep whilst asleep and drove my vehicle into the back end of another tank......cringe....      Rebooted the wrong server - resulting in collapse of a large international broker being unable to trade for about 2 hours while the systems desperately resynchronised. How many millions of $ worth of business were lost we never did find out.      While I was working at an NHS laundry, the main washing machine (about 20m long) had broken down and was being repaired and re- welded. Unfortunately the Welder had earthed himself to the drum of the machine without realising it and as well as shooting across the building like Gonzo from the Muppets he managed to fuse all the electric's in the washer. The two-week repair delay cost us two major contracts and the laundry closed 6 months later! By then I was working for the local cable company, but that's a different story...      Having had numerous and varied jobs, my blunders have also been numerous and varied, from turning a woman's hair green as an apprentice hairdresser, to putting overtime on half the mechanics' time cards at a factory while training in the office. In the end I thought it safer for all concerned to retire from the workplace.      Based in Bedfont, Middlesex at the time, I was arranging an appointment for one of my sales managers in Hull. The person he was meeting with phoned the day before to postpone but I failed to pass on the message to the sales manager. The following day he phoned me from the car on his enormously long journey all chirpy and cheerful 'for a chat' on his boring journey and I happily talked to him totally forgetting about the postponement. A couple of hours later, he phoned again and his tone of voice was much more serious this time. You know that feeling when your heart disappears through the end of your toes at twice the speed of sound???? "
HOC HOC-KU -1.28 " Hanna Barbera cartoons were always a part of my childhood. I remembered watching the Flintstones way back in '71. I also watched Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear and Scooby Doo from '72 onwards. What I find fascinating about these cartoons is that they are evergreen. They are as suitable for children now as they were before. My children are now enjoying the cartoons as much as I did decades ago. News of Mr Hanna's death has certainly evoked memories in me. It is so hard to believe so many years have gone by since the last time I watched these cartoons. May he rest in peace.      My children sit down and watch cartoons that I used to watch, waiting for my mum to cook the tea. They bring back so many memories and I never tire of watching them again and again (thanks to Cartoon Network). Bill Hanna was indeed smarter than the average bear.      I must admit, sitting here, I find it hard to imagine a world without Tom & Jerry. I think, in terms of modern culture, these characters have more significance than, for example, Shakespearean characters.      I've always loved Hanna-Barbera cartoons, ever since I was little. They've brought me so much happiness over the years. Bill, you will be missed greatly.      Thank you Bill for your outstanding work during all these years. I cannot imagine my childhood without Scooby Doo, or with out any of your great cartoons, me, my child and my grandchildren would like to say: You're Yaba Daba great!      The Flintstones were great because they could entertain the whole family. It's a good thing to have a laugh with your Mum and Dad. Thanks, Bill!      Growing up, we loved to see the Flintstones and Top Cat and Yogi Bear. They made our afternoons fun and simple. The cartoons today are mainly super trash - even our grandchildren enjoy the older cartoons of Mr Hanna more than these so-called super heroes. I am sorry he has died. It is a great loss for all children at heart.      The cartoon network will never be the same ever again. The loss of such a gallant genius can never be overcome!      Words are not enough to tell how much love the old and new generations have for you, in fact your cartoons are the only things I still remember from my childhood, you have enriched our imaginations with sweet and funny values, we will never forget you.      Saturday mornings were special to me when I was a kid. No school, I could play with my friends and I could watch Space Ghost, The Herculoids, and Mightorr. William Hanna had some very good cartoons, better than the rubbish they show today.      I'm 60 years old and love all the early and recent Hanna-Barbera cartoons. My son was a writer on ""Dexter's Laboratory"" which started before Hanna-Barbera became the Cartoon Network.      My favourite cartoon, being Russian Jewish, has got to be Yogi Bear because Ranger Smith always wants to send Yogi to Siberia.      They may not have had the big budgets of Disney, but the simple, honest fun of Scooby Doo, The Flintstones and Wacky Races and the timeless comic brilliance of Tom and Jerry, knock today's mindless toy and commercial tie-ins for six! Thank-you for the pleasure you have given to millions of children over the years (and indeed many grown-ups too)!      I, like many others I am sure, grew up with Tom and Gerry, Scooby Doo and the rest of the cartoon family. They will remain timeless classics and bring humour to many generations to come. Hanna was a man with a child's imagination and he kept that with him all his life. A great loss to the cartoon world.      Growing up as a child would never have been the same without Fred, yogi, Tom and Jerry just before bedtime! Thanks for the joy they brought us then and now. You may have left us now but the memories will continue. Rest peacefully friend.      Bill Hanna showed us some magical cartoon moments and he realised that what people wanted was to be entertained by things that were fun. I got out an old Tom and Jerry video from my childhood recently and watched it. Either I haven't grown up or those cartoons are just incredibly funny. The quality of them shows true craftsmanship.      William Hanna may have left but his work will live on. He has given both my Husband and I great memories of our childhood. He gave my children endless hours of great fun. We love Tom and Jerry and still watch them to this day, they rule!      Who didn't grow up loving Scooby Doo, the Flintstones and Tom and Jerry? William Hanna was a great man who has given joy to millions of children all over the world, and his legacy will continue to give joy to millions more children for generations to come.      William brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people - young and old alike. Truly a legend in his own lifetime. He will live on through this art. Heaven is in for some humour at last!      It's sad when anyone dies, but, alas, that does not necessarily raise their work, however influential, to the level of genius. The Hanna-Barbera cartoons used simplistic repeating backgrounds, repetitive action frames, and character stereotypes to provide mindless entertainment.      Despite my being a child of the 1980s, I always loved the work of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, especially the likes of ""Hong Kong Phooey"", ""Wacky Races"", and of course, the timeless classic, ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You?"" Okay, Scooby Doo BEFORE Scrappy Doo was introduced...      It's one of those things you know will happen eventually, but never want it to come, namely the death of one of animation's pioneers. Hanna and Barbera not only pushed forward the boundaries of cartoons, they also made them a prime requisite for TV viewing with the Flintstones, Jetsons and Scooby-Doo. But Tom and Jerry is the real classic to me; a basic concept, yet so much humour and life brought out of a simple cat and mouse...      I am really saddened by his death as others are. My whole family have grown up with the cartoons such as Scooby Doo, The Flintstones and Wacky Races. I'm 13 and I've watched many of his greatest cartoons. I think the very first cartoon I saw was The Flintstones, as my parents had bought a video for me and my brother to watch. My all time favourites have to be The Flintstones, Scooby Doo and Dick Dastardly and Muttley. He will be greatly missed.      Considering how much laughter and joy he gave to kids (and kids at heart) all over the world for over half a century, Bill Hanna is certainly one of the greatest figures of 20th century. RIP, and thank you...      Clearly a man who was ""smarter than the average bear""! The likes of the Flintstones is obviously the inspiration behind the only good modern cartoon, ""The Simpsons"". He gave us ""pesky kids"" many hours of pleasure.      William Hannah was a fantastic animator who gave so much laughter and joy to children and adults alike. He will be sorely missed, but thanks to technology - his work and his legend will go on forever. Rest In Peace and God Bless all he leaves behind who loved him.      What sad news. My childhood was all the richer for Scooby (though not Scrappy!), Captain Caveman, Hong Kong Fuey and his clever cat, Top Cat, Wait Till Your Father Gets Home and all the rest. I agree with the others, the cartoons the kids watch today are nothing in comparison.      I remember one particular Tom and Jerry cartoon centred around a pool table. The gags were totally hilarious and showed a great deal of originality and comic genius. It's one of my fondest memories from my childhood as I remember my two brothers and I, paralysed from laughter on the floor with aching stomach muscles, almost unable to breath, tears streaming down our red faces for a good 15 minutes! Thank you, William Hanna.      Hong Kong Phooey was the MAN.      Although he is dead, ""Tom & Jerry"" remains forever in my heart.      A hugely talented man who bought joy to millions of children (aged 3-70) all over the world.      Even as an adult I can't resist watching Tom and Jerry and I passed this tradition on to my daughter Hamsatu. RIP William Hanna.      Thank you ...      His cartoons (of which I believe Tom and Jerry was the weakest) were good alternatives to the boring, romantic nature of some Walt Disney cartoons. Their sense of humour was rather European and they were full-length mirrors of modern time. Remember Top Cat?      The man who gives children laughter will never be forgotten. He certainly was smarter than the average bear      A sad loss to the world. His cartoons are timeless and enjoyable for all ages. For those of us who grew up watching them they will forever be an indelible part of our childhood. May he rest in peace.      A genius. I suspect most adults could still sit down and watch Yogi, Fred Flintstone, Tom and Jerry etc. just as they did as children. I know I could (and do!). Now kids have to watch rubbish like Power Rangers and Pokemon. They don't know they're born...      William Hanna was the founder of simple, entertaining cartoons which were always pleasing to the eye. Today's cartoons make me feel like a pensioner; they're extremely complicated, look harsh and angular, are aggressive and more infuriatingly, ALWAYS have a 'moral of the story' ending. And by the way, what is Pokemon all about?      The early episodes of the Flintstones, Tom and Jerry and Scooby Doo were fantastic. I've always wondered though how much input he had later on when a lot of these cartoons started going down-hill. Why did Tom and Jerry start stalling? Why was Scrappy Doo introduced? Who gave the go-ahead to turn the Flintstones (and Scooby Doo) into Hollywood flopbusters? The work of William Hanna was incredible, but I do think that external forces spoiled his creativity.      William Hanna RIP Long live the Fintstones, Yogi and Cie.      I grew up with the impeccable humour, timing and animation of Tom and Jerry. I thank his work for having inspired me to become an animator myself. May he rest in peace. Or better still, may he reincarnate soon to entertain us with more characters.      It is remarkable how he made fun of the adult world in a way perceivable by children. Nowadays, is there a cartoon to depict a relationship nearly as well as Hanna did with Fred and Wilma Flintstone? No, modern animators can't find anything humorous in such things, preferring the absurd (a la ""Cow and Chicken"") and violence.      Like all of us, I and my family grew up with Tom and Jerry. Even as a grandparent now, I can't resist watching them. He has brought joy not only to the children, but that child today has grown up to become a grandparent. He brought joy to millions of people, where religion or race did not have any barrier. Many, many thanks to him and may his soul rest in peace.      Go Puppy Power! I join your other correspondents in their tributes to Bill Hanna. However, I must act as the lone voice in support of Scrappy Doo. Scrappy remains an underestimated talent!      Hanna Barbera cartoons are loved not only in the great countries such as US or UK or Europe. Coming from a Third World country, my life was filled with Tom and Jerry, the Flintstones and what not. I used to fight with my small sister for those cartoons - even just a few years ago and I'm 24 now. "
HOC HOC-MU -0.91 " Well if British food is bland compared to the rest of Europe - at least its safe to eat. The French for example have an extremely bad reputation for hygiene.      I was brought up on traditional British cooking. It did not include fish and chips, tripe, steak and kidney pudding, spotted dick, or any of the other fat-saturated stodge that seems to be associated with this island. Good, nourishing soups and stews were essential elements, and I have never tasted better in any of the many countries I have visited. Certainly there was a lack of flavoursome spices, but the quality of the basic ingredients was unsurpassed. I believe that British cooking has a lot to offer if only it would be presented in its traditional form, that of the good home cooking that was once present in every region.      I spent a couple of weeks touring provincial France by car thirty years ago, sampling their fare at a variety of local restaurants as I went. I was never so glad to get back to England to eat some REAL food. I have never seen any foreign restaurant yet that could beat the excellent food I have encountered while on holiday in Great Britain.      Having just finished a lunch of Scottish meat pies and ""real"" HP sauce that I have shipped in from a shop in Maine, I can honestly say that I enjoy British food. Oh French cuisine is fine. I just find it difficult to hold my nose that far in the air for any length of time...      The UK has become a nation of microwavable-food eaters, with absolutely no passion for cooking (except perhaps Jamie Oliver). Nothing we have here can come close to the fresh food available on the continent. Bread straight from the oven and fruit straight from the tree are de rigeur in France, Spain and Italy. Of all the European countries, Italian food has to be the best. Those who have only have sampled food from an Italian restaurant have no idea what real Italian food is. If you ever have a chance to eat with a native family you are in for a rare treat! Bon appetit!      To Nick Bell - the best chocolate is not made in the UK but in either Belgium or Switzerland. Most British chocolate is far too weak in taste and it's also too sweet.      British food is good and underestimated. The myriad pies, roasts, puddings, pastries and cakes are a treat. Pub grub has its own flavour. I had the pleasure of trying these out on my trip to the UK in '97. May Brit food continue to prosper.      The ""French"" kitchen is as varied as any - there is a huge diversity between the culinary traditions of, say, Alsace and the Roussillon, or Normandy and the Savoye. It is unlikely that anyone will find all French cooking to their taste. Anyway, why should anyone have to choose? Surely it is quite possible to enjoy both bangers and mash and boudin, both bubble and squeak and Strasbourg choucroute, both beans on toast and cassoulet, both roast beef and Yorkshire pudding and poule au pot, both Lancashire hotpot and bouillabaisse. And incidentally, I have never eaten better porridge -- with salt -- than in Russia.      I have enjoyed wonderful food in Britain, but always of international style. Traditional British food gives me indigestion. Modern food, widely available in Britain, is as good as anywhere. American food may be hearty, but you can go weeks in the US without seeing a vegetable. Italian cuisine is superb, but they are mean with the portions served in restaurants, lots of pasta, a dribble of sauce, but where's the meat? Seldom get to try the food in France other than to fill up on the free bread whilst waiting to be served.      I can't resist a comment on food as a ""food fan"". I think French food is quite pretentious. They do have some good dishes but French food as a whole is highly over-estimated. British food - I would not comment. It is my conviction that the richest food culture and tradition is in Asia.      I've been amused while living in Hong Kong by the eating habits of some of our European cousins. A couple of times I've been on holiday with Swiss and German expats to other Asian destinations. I'm always game for trying a local dish or two, especially a good ""British"" curry - our cosmopolitan Europeans? They always head for the nearest dreary, tiresome Wiener Schnitzel, Sauerkraut and dumplings - all the while deploring British food! They really haven't a clue about traditional British dishes, best just to ignore them, I find!      I've just come back from France and have to say that some of the restaurant food was every bit as bad as anything you might find in the UK. British food is not up to much, but then what great culinary contributions have most countries around the world made? Germany? sauerkraut and sausages! Holland? herrings! Spain? paella and tapas, like wow? Eastern Europe? Boiled meat and potatoes! Scandinavia - ? The only truly great and diverse cuisine comes from Italy which benefits from its regional culture. Real Italian food kicks French and Asian food right into touch.      Thanks to the average Briton now being one of the most travelled on earth I think the food in recent years has improved markedly. Much of the problems in the past was due in part to the terrible war and the few years after when food rationing of two lamb chops per week was the ration per person. I was stationed there during those sad years and have since seen improvements. I asked a head waiter in Frankfurt in 1956 what he thought of British cooking as he had apprenticed there for a year in one of the finest London hotels, ""Shocking."" Your tech schools and travel are changing this for the better.      I don't want to hurt anyone but the English food is boring if you compare it with the French food. There is a real lack of imagination and creativity. And snails could be delicious with a good sauce. I've been to England for some 3 months and I found that English products are without any taste. All foreigners complain about English food. It's famous ?      When asked to comment on the Heinz plan to withdraw Salad Cream from their product range, who was it that said: ""I have never understood Salad Cream""?      The quality of the cook itself is far more important than the cuisine. It doesn't matter from which cuisine the meal is if it isn't cooked properly. But that doesn't state anything about the expectations of the guests. I made lots of visits to France, and I found that the French appreciate cuisines that are more like theirs, like the Italian cuisine and the Algerian. The British cuisine is apparently too different from the French.      Why go to Paris and eat English food? I love Marmite, Toad in the Hole etc but wait until I go home to England to eat them.      I'm a big fan of world cuisine but I don't think French food would even make my top ten. Some of their exports are nice enough (cheese and wine) but the rest of their fayre is pretty dire.      What the Brits lack in some of their main dishes, they make up for in their chocolate.      Oh please, let's not drag out the old nonsense about the British being lousy cooks serving up sloppy food. Twaddle! Other than the British people, the best thing about visiting the UK is traditional British food. What I wouldn't give on any morning to tuck into that most sublime of culinary pleasures: the full English breakfast. I have travelled the world and British cooking, both native and foreign, is among the best in the world. And not just the fancy restaurants. The best English breakfast I've had is served at a tiny place at the bus station in Exmouth for #3.75. So to blazes with the French and pass the brown sauce please.      I would have thought that the decision by Mcdonalds to buy into Pret a Manger indicates that English cuisine is good. There are many restaurants in the US which try to emulate British cooking and fail miserably. Stuck in a restaurant in Niagra falls where they had failed to parboil the potatoes before making chips, I was accosted by a Canadian woman who wanted to know how I could make her Yorkshire puddings rise.      British food is terrible! I have been to many countries and every one has much better food than we do. Better taste, variety and proportions.      As is usual with any prejudice it is all based on ignorance. People like Volker (Germany), who assume that all British food is fried something and chips, basically have no idea what British food is. You very rarely get a cheap meal anywhere in Europe that does not come with chips, especially France. But here we don't promote our local cuisine so nobody knows about it. Also the British seem to be much more adventurous when it comes to food - that's why we have one of the most varied selection of international restaurants anywhere. Even my local pub here in East London is now a Columbian tapas bar!      Why is every one assuming that traditional British cooking is fish and chips or unhealthy? I admit traditional British canteen food can be unappetising, however a homemade meal made with fresh ingredients can be both healthy and enjoyable. For example roast gammon in cider and fresh vegetables followed by baked apples.      Who really gives a damn what the French, or anybody else, think of our cooking! Personally I have cravings while away from home, usually for a nice hot Cornish Pasty!      Living here in Kansas is good, but as a young man born and bred in England I really miss such things as Bangers and Mash, Cornish Pasties, Trifle etc. Wish there was a quote ""British"" cafe here in Kansas City.      There is still nothing as wonderful as a ploughmans' (extra brannie, and two pints!)      Any food can be prepared badly. I get the shivers when I see what the rest of America thinks is Pizza (New York having what is generally considered to be the best pizza). But I bet if you went to someone's house in Italy you'd be blown away by their Pizza. What you are served in a restaurant as typical regional food bears little resemblance to the ""real thing"" (if that exists at all). British cuisine is doing well here in New York. ""Tea & Sympathy"" have just opened a fish and chip shop on Greenwich Street which is going down very well with the natives.      British ingredients are first rate, British chefs are some of the best, our traditional recipes can be fantastic. The problem lies in our lack of care in how we cook and present food and our desire to take short cuts in preparing food.      We can't compete with the French on food. Our whole attitude has to change first, not least to service. A waiter in France has to know about the food and wine as well as understanding service. In the UK, service is generally appalling at all but the very best restaurant. You can eat for #20 in France and have a meal that would probably cost three or four times that in London.      Actually, Britain doesn't necessarily lose out by having boring, bland, or unhealthy 'cuisine'. I have found that the choice of foreign, and ethnic restaurants in the UK to be far greater and of far better quality than anywhere else in the world, probably as a result of this.      I will agree. It's not as good as it was thirty years ago or so. That is because of all the foreign food that Europe is making us take on our shelves. Why can't this once great and good nation take its place amongst the master of good food and wine again?      I am a vegetarian. Recently I went to Paris for a conference in a high quality hotel and the attempt at a vegetarian meal (i.e. a plateful of vegetables) was quite appalling, and showed a total lack of imagination. There again, what do you expect from a nation who eat horses?      Whilst driving around many different parts of France I have found that no matter where you stop to eat you are almost guaranteed good food. Even the more basic meals, steak-au-poivre, chips and salad are almost always great. The same can not be said of the UK. It is normally a surprise if any cheap(ish) meal in this country is decent. You can still find places that have fruit juice listed as a starter - unbelievable.      The worst meal I ever had was chicken - burnt on the outside, raw in the middle - near Nice, France!      British food has a bad reputation in Germany, but I'm afraid I don't think this is justified. They - all 81 million Germans - certainly don't know how to make a decent cuppa. Generalisations are always dangerous, but the amount of fat used in German cooking far outweighs that in Britain as they fry everything. No, you just can't beat a full English breakfast, and I think the whole world knows that really by instinct.      As a Scot, married to a French lady from Normandy I can honestly say that there is not a lot of difference between everyday French food and everyday British food. Admittedly the French eat more fresh fruit and vegetables than we do, but in Normandy at least vegetables are normally served smothered in cr?me fraiche. A traditional Sunday dinner is more or less the same too. Roast animal of some kind, with vegetables and potatoes. Restaurants are different, and not just 'high class' ones. Most motorway service stations in France serve better food than is served in restaurants here! Oh and a quick word to Jenny from Scotland. Cassoulet made with an old scrag-end of mutton is tres bon and boiled tripe is the speciality of Caen, my wife's home town. I prefer escargots to just about any other food!      British food is adequate for the majority of British people. A bit like the pound.      British cuisine may not be the best but I challenge anyone to find a breakfast anywhere in the world that beats a 'Full English' - croissants, pah!      Although I enjoy SOME English food, I am not a huge fan. I find that dishes do not have enough flavour and are often too bland. Of all the restaurants I could choose, it certainly would not be one with English cuisine. Saying that, I can't resist a Sunday roast at the pub!      I think we have some wonderful restaurants around England. We also have the opportunity to pop into the local pub and have a meal at a reasonable prices. Snails and frogs legs, no thanks! My perception is that the French don't favour anything from England, even our singing - nil point!!!!!!!      Maybe if the relationship between the UK and France was a little more amicable this restaurant may have flourished.      I travel extensively overseas and have many opportunities to sample and enjoy the local cuisine. Traditional British cooking, I hesitate to use the word cuisine, is invariably unappealing, unimaginative and unappetising by comparison, with perhaps the exception of Belarus. However, this is probably a reflection of the average, unimaginative British taste, which, at its worst, is manifest in those ghastly ersatz traditional British restaurants and cafes that infest popular holiday resorts in Spain. As has been said before: ""The French live to eat; the British eat to live"".      The answer is no, it is not inadequate. British food is good, wholesome food. The problem is that it is not served in the same fashion that the continentals like, so they say it is rubbish. I have worked in Germany for nearly 2? years now, I have also worked in the Netherlands and had several holidays in France. I have to say that in most cases, wherever I have been the food is good. What the UK needs is not so much a lesson in cooking but in serving!      I wake up, have a full ""English"" breakfast, have a slice of ""Italian"" pizza at lunchtime, ""Indian"" curry for dinner and a ""'Turkish"" kebab on the way home from the club. The people in the UK who are of Italian, Indian and Turkish descent are British to me, and so is their food!      As a student I shared a house with many foreign students who were of the same impression, so one day I took it upon myself to make a 16 course meal which would include Welsh, Scottish and English food. We had stew, dumplings, cowl, black pudding, Yorkshire pudding, haggis, bread and butter pudding. The list was endless. Having eaten their fill, they all agreed that Britain's regional food is perhaps our best-kept secret. I stay in contact with them all and I am still sending them recipes.      Did the restaurant have HP Sauce? That would have made it truly authentic!      The days when British cooking meant stodgy, fatty, tasteless gunk are long gone. If you really enjoy that kind of food you can still find it, but the best British cooking is to be found in country pubs, using fresh local produce.      How can anyone who eats snails complain???      It's a bit of a problem as soon somebody is a bit health conscious. English meals are very high in fat and are usually not nice to look at. Egg and chips? Sausages and mash? Cooking books that teach how to boil an egg? Hardly any competition for anyone who is in search of healthy food with a bit of flavour. The English 'cuisine' is very simple and therefore has no appeal to any restaurant goers who are out for a treat.      Talking of British Cuisine is like talking about German humour; French generosity; Italian self-control; Belgian usefulness; or American modesty.      As a whole, the French people appear to reject anything that is not French. Hence I am not surprised that a 'British' restaurant did not appeal to them. My husband has eaten at Berties in Paris and found it to be an elitist interpretation of British cuisine: where else would you find deep fried battered salmon served as fish and chips! Bring back the traditional Sunday roast lunch!      Yes I think in a lot of cases we can match up to other countries when it comes to cuisine. Where we cannot hold a candle to the other countries is the service that is provided in our restaurants and cafes. We must be the worlds worst.      I think that British cuisine can be far superior to French, and vice-versa: it all depends on the quality of products used, and the chef doing the cooking. British fish, fruit and vegetables can be wonderful, but an old scrag-end of mutton, or boiled tripe are hardly going to fire up the palate!      The French have an inherent parochialism and accordingly non-French items will always struggle to sell in France.      English cuisine has improved tremendously from what it was when I went to England as a student in 1963. I remember that roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, toad in the hole and Brussels sprouts. It took some getting used to food that had no spices. One had to dress it with black pepper and salt that was set before you on the table. The fish and chips, or savaloy and chips wrapped in the newspaper were other interesting presentations. However I grew to love the fish and chips and Welsh rarebit with beans that kept me alive and healthy during my days as a student. When I began to earn money the Wiltshire duckling and good steaks covered with French mustard was enjoyable and delicious especially at the restaurants and pubs around Godalming Surrey.     In general I think the British have fairly bland tastes. My girlfriend's mum has never tried anything spicier than a Pot Noodle. Although I enjoy things such as pie and mash it does not really inspire creativity.      I like snails!      Uhhhh....we are talking snails here - that's molluscs. No siree, no thanks - I'll just stick to my black pudding, thank you very much. "
JOC JOC-15B-15N 0.37 "Frankly speaking, this news is very difficult for me to understand clearly because relations among all parties concerned is too complicated. For the time being, it is almost impossible for us to know a truth of the incident of shutting down a Russian fighter jet. Additionally, it is more important to fight against ISIS than to know a truth of the incident. So, I strongly believe that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, according to the news, Turkey is buying millions of dollars of oil in the black market from ISIS. Considering these conditions, it seems difficult to have closer ties between two counties.  It exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year. For an import of gas country from Russia, Turkey is a customer of the second place next to Germany. On the other hand, Turkey exported food of 1 billion dollars (approximately 120 billion yen) to Russia in first nine months of 2015. The main item is a tomato and citrus fruits, and these occupy half or more of the import. The Mayor of Kuno Berri center thinks that Russia may not limit the import of vegetables before a holiday of the New Year. On the other hand, it is said that I seem to tighten hygiene management. A main import item from other Turkey includes cloth and textiles. Most of retailers of Russian clothing and the footwear place an order in a factory of Turkey. Cloth imported according to the data of Russian Federation Office for National Statistics for first nine months of 2015 from Turkey to Russia and the textiles 514 million dollars (approximately 61, 680 million yen), the footwear 48 million dollars (approximately 5, 760 million yen). When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. However, I think that the action, Turkish government will pass new legislation to ban Kurdish activity and weaken the HDP and other opposition parties, will not get better, because this action will not connect democratization. One-party dictatorship will be spread weakening the HDP, and the opinion of the people will be ignored. In these difficult affairs, it is important for the country to listen to the voice of the people. Also, the relation between Turkey and Russia will be needed to improve. The incident that the soldier, who protects the country, was killed must not be happened, but in these affairs, the conflict like this can be increased. These countries' purpose is same, to solve the problem about ISIS, therefore I wish these countries would cooperate well.  This news is very difficult for me. When I read this article for the first time, I couldn't understand. First there is a Turkish folk problem. Only 1 race lived in Japan, so I couldn't understand a folk problem so much. There is a problem of ISIS with the 2nd. ISIS came to do terrorism at Europe as well as the Middle East. I fear ISIS. I'm hoping the moment is also early and for this world to become peaceful.  Russia and Turkey developed the war of ten several times for many centuries. However, I continued the friendly relationship that was not seen so far for these past 20 years. Even if the shooting down of the Russian military plane with the Turkish military plane of 24th does not lead to the military collision of the two countries, what two countries relations are cooling rapidly is apparent to anyone. They fanned the nationalist-like mood of the nation for many years to get support of the general public in autocratic leaders with the President of Putin Russia, the Erdogan President of Turkey. Both of them shelved the difference in the foreign policy until now and were bent to plan two countries affiliated expansion. Although they are opposed by Syria, Cyprus, a problem of Ukraine, the trade relations of the two countries present an active state. But, by military plane shooting down in Russia, the separation of politics and the economy became impossible. They let feelings get excited with the two countries, and Russia moves in retaliation early. Manager dormitory tray Nin of the Carnegie international peace foundation Moscow center explains, ""the relations that Russia and Turkey got after Cold War end will be cut off for the duration, and the two countries relations came back to hostility, doubt, the relations of the competition""; ""relations between the top are what was spoiled, and it is a relation of ""sultan"" and ""czar"" that is extremely important. Erdogan, both of them of Putin have already spoken each other, They are not with expectation of a partner. In addition, a factor to deepen this crack does not have it, or the difference in thought about the situation of Syria and ISIL is regarded as uneasiness, too. I knew such a Russia and the historic opposition of Turkey by having learned world history, but was surprised that such an opposition lasted to the present. In addition, it might be hard to understand the problem that such a religion affected too much from the country such as religion-coloured thin Japan, but it was the problem that was important for the person concerned and thought that it was what it was hard to solve.  I exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year. For an import of gas country from Russia, Turkey is a customer of the second place next to Germany. On the other hand, Turkey exported food of 1 billion dollars (approximately 120 billion yen) to Russia in first nine months of 2015.

When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus After I read this article, I thought two things about it. First, I think Turk should be more collaborative with Kurds. Kurds are desiring to have their own country for many years. The fault information by AKP made their dream become not true. So it is a must that HDP should win next time. In order to do that, HDP and other opposition parties should get together and defeat AKP to stop the new registration. Second, most of the problem in the Middle East is involved in Islamic state. So I think it is best to form an alliance with countries in the Middle East. If the existence of Islamic state disappeared, most of the problem would be solved.  Conflicts between Turkey and Russia made me surprise. Turkey and Russia battled many times in the past days. I thought it may be the return of the Crimean War. I would like to keep a close watch on this news.  I agree with your opinion. When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. Also, I think that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, at the same time, we should think people in ISIS, I think. Why they keep to do terrorism? Why the terrorism has been happened? Standing the side of each other, this problem of terrorism will be close to solved.  It is very difficult problem for me. Turkey and Russia are insisting each different insistence. The other tell a lie but we can't tell the different. Now, International society have to make corporation to attack ISIS so I want to talk frank between two countries. I want to make peacemaking two countries.  I disagree with you. In ancient, Turkey and Russia didn't get on well with each other. There are a lot of conflicts between them. This incident is one of conflicts. So, I am not worried about the incident. However, my interesting only point is that US helps or doesn't help Turkey. "
JOC JOC-15B-16N 1.7 "I was very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time. Additionally, I was very surprised to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. If it is true, this decision should not be allowed and should be overturned. Recently, there was injustice such as emblem relating to Tokyo Olympic in 2020. I feel that there are so many injustice relating to sports. I strongly believe that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way.  Corruption of the soccer world is not to have begun in now. A bribe and the purchase of Juventus, put-up games are taking place many times. Because a demon of the soccer world appeared on the face in this way, you should stare at the soccer world taking advantage of this again.  I had shocked when I heard this news. I think the sport, from the soccer down, should not be used a dirty money. This is occasion of declining content. Soccer and baseballs bribe news reached our ears. Of course these sports are popularity so, reached our ears. But still this is not good situation.  When I read this news, I couldn't contain my anger. People who hold responsible posts should act rationally. If they receive a bribe, they lose their trust from people. I expect their future activities that get them regaining their trust.  When I heard this news for the first time, I was very shocked. Football is one of the popular sports, of course I like it. Hearing such the news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. This news is a good example, Due to some people's action, many problem is appeared. Actually, when I heard that the host country of 2022 World Cup was decided Qatar, I think that why Qatar were decided. However, being these problems, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Nowadays, there are many news of gambling. This move can connect decreasing the popularity of the sport, so I wish these actions would disappear.  I was quite shocked about a corruption problem of FIFA. Because FIFA is the organization of the very big soccer, and the soccer World Cup FIFA sponsors is a very popular meet as well as Olympics. Wonderful protuberance is also shown by World Cup in Japan. Such, I can't hide surprise from being corruption by the authoritative organization internationally. I'll reform the organization and want you to be the sound organization immediately.  I like soccer very much. I have practiced soccer for 12 years. So I'm sorry to hear the news like this. But soccer regularly captures headlines around the globe for its nail-biting action. But on Wednesday, May 27, the sport captured people's attention for a different reason. More than a dozen FIFA officials were arrested on corruption charges in Zurich, Switzerland after a four-year investigation by the US government. To begin with FIFA is the French acronym for the Federation Internationale de Football Association. In the U.S. , football is known as soccer. The organization, headquartered in Zurich, oversees 209 national soccer associations and puts together tournaments, including the World Cup. FIFA makes billions from this international tournament held every four years. Much of this money comes from TV broadcast rights and marketing deals. US officials charged 14 people with 47 criminal charges related to bribery. A dozen different schemes were included in the formal charges. Prosecutors said that hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal payments were made to unfairly influence media rights deals and the outcome of FIFA elections. ""We welcome the actions and the investigations by the U. S. and Swiss authorities, "" said FIFA president Sepp Blatter. ""[We] believe it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football. "" Blatter was reelected to a fifth term on May 29, despite calls to postpone the election amid the investigationss. I was surprised that though there was such a case, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I think this is ridiculous. So that soccer continues being loved by many people, I pray for FIFA becoming the group deserving Nobel Peace prize truly without causing a corruption case in the future.  When I heard this news, I had a feeling like that ""I'm hearing such news relates corruption almost every day. "". I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a crime.  It is a pity that Sepp Blatter and MIchel Platini, who are the most influential persons of football society, acted bribery. FIFA is one of the biggest sports institutions of the world , and football is one of the most popular sports, so I want it act properly and improve environment of football. As it is professional, it is natural that it expects economic effect, but we mustn't forget that the role of FIFA is not only developing football but also becoming an element of cooperation between countries and nations. I like football very much and have played it for more than ten years , so I hope football society advancing more and more. This kind of matter can prevent football from advancing well, so I can't forgive any bribery.  Bribery and corruption are unavoidable throughout the world. Even in Japan, it is not only foreign affair but that exists in this country. However, FIFA is international association so that they should act quite fairly. As United Nation isn't working well, we have to organize many things in order and must clarify many evils. Football is popular sports all over the world, which means that there are many fans especially children in poor countries. Football is regarded as simple sport that anyone can play and require only a ball. It gives hopes and fineness to everybody, so there shouldn't be any corruption in that world.  I like football so I've heard the rumor of corruption before. But this was the first time to read on newspaper. I know Blatter has done so many great things by using football as a tool make two countries cooperate and so on. And he might have deserved to get Nobel peace Prize, if he had not done the bribery. There should not be money involved in any sports because it would make them so boring. I remember when Korea cheated in FIFA World Cup in 2002. Basically they gave money to the referee and that ruined the whole match in that World Cup. We should keep it clean by any means.  I am not the first time that I hear the news of this type of story. It makes us distrust about sports. Watching sports becomes lively simply because it is a fair fight, and the fighting person performs it seriously. These are basics of sports and are what you must certainly follow. So I think that corruption is often bad news when I heard this word. But, by this article Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". This remark is a remark to deserve praise for the corruption. I can not understand exactly if his contribution into the world's humanitarian sphere is huge as he was always trying to use football not only as sports but also as an element of cooperation between countries and nations. From this article we should learn a way of the right corruption.  I agree with your opinion. This kind of news often reached our ears. Sports such as soccer, baseball should be fair. There may be some people who lost the trust about sports. So, we should be careful not to get up by such a case.  I somewhat disagree with your opinion. Of course bribery is bad thing and never be allowed, but in many sports broadcasting in TV, money-making is one of the most important thing. The move of connecting sports and business is now prosperous. For example, there is an institution that forecast victory or defeat of football games, that is called TOTO. TOTO is popular gambling of sports. Sports and money can't completely cut off.  I got shocked read this article. But many soccer funs have been noticed that FIFA is corrupted and receive a bribe. So I was shocked but was no surprised. In the wake of this I hope that FIFA will be reborn and be a clean organization. By the way Not only in soccer but also many sports such as in baseball we often hear about the bribe. They people who are involved are rich enough. Why do they offer such dirty money? I cannot understand that.  I agree with your opinion. Like this gambling news in sport respect may be some people who lost the trust about sports. I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. Gambling and bribe is occasion of declining content. I wish these actions would disappear too.  I agree with your opinion. I was also very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time, hearing such a news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Like you, I also suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. I wish that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way.  I agree with you. Certainly, FIFA was corrupted and reserved many bribes. I have heard the rumors that other sport organizations is corrupted several times. I can't understand doing such a things, too. However, FIFA will try to become clear organization. About dirty of other sport organization, many people will know it in near future.  When I read this article, I couldn't hide my surprise. I like soccer very much, so I knew all the name which mentioned in this article. They were all fantastic football player in the pasty days. However, they breeded graft and corruption. Did they lose their sportsmanship? I think they should be strongly blamed for this corruption.  I felt the same as you. I was completely stunned by the news of FIFA corruptions. I have being a lover of football for a long time and always watch the game during the weekend. Therefore, I am very disappointed by this terrible news. I hope things will get better in the future.  It seems that I hear such news relates corruption almost every day. I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a clime.  I haven't known that. For me, your opinion is so interesting. When I heard this news first, I felt that it is very rare case of Corruption of the soccer world. Because I have not heard yet in my life. In the baseball world or Sumo world, the corruptions happened often, however, in the soccer world that exist. The fact is so disappointed but I am glad to know the real knowledge about the soccer world.  I researched about this news because I was interested in. The result of research, according to the first page of this sight, ""Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) into wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. "" Soccer is one of the popular sport so I want them to take back the position and the honor.  I read this news and I shocked that knew the fact. Therefore I want more information so I research the FIFA, football's world governing body, has been engulfed by claims of widespread corruption since summer 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives. It has now claimed the careers of two of the most powerful men in football, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Uefa President Michel Platini, after they were banned for eight years from all football-related activities by FIFA's ethics committee. A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is also continuing. FIFA's president Sepp Blatter has always denied any wrongdoing - but in September, he too was made the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation, launched alongside the US inquiry. The scandal erupted in May, with a raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich and the arrest of seven FIFA executives - conducted at the behest of the US authorities. In May the US indicted 14 current and former FIFA officials and associates on charges of ""rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted"" corruption following a major inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . And in December, 16 more officials were charged following the arrest of two FIFA vice-presidents in at the same hotel in Zurich. Former Brazil football federation chief Ricardo Teixeira was among those accused of being ""involved in criminal schemes involving well over $200m in bribes and kickbacks"".  I think so too. I think sport is the thing which gives people dream and the courage to live. I don't want to see this kind of article. It was so shocking.  I think so that the corruption like this leads to unsporting behavior. In this case, there is a strong possibility that the host country of the World Cup is decided by dishonest means. The host country has a very important role, and people in the host country might be going to go wild more than anyone in the other countries. Therefore, there is no doubt that the host country and FIFA cease to be trusted by this corruption. They make a mess of the worldwide event.  I think this fraud of FIFA should be poised strictly, because top, famous groups' mistakes can cause great influence even if it is very small. "
JOC JOC-12A-07N 10.81 "I thought that it was a dangerous problem, when this news was read. If population decreases as it is and elderly people increase in number, economy will contract. Therefore, the environment where elderly people can do work is required. If elderly people cannot do work, economy will reduce further. it is important to support a young man's child rearing at elderly people working.  This problem will occur in near future. So it is important to think about it from now. Japan has a lot of debt , so we can't rely on social security. I think making elderly people possible to work for a long period is good idea.  Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder.  When I knew this news, I thought that this was a serious problem to greatly influence in the future in Japan. Elderly people of Japan increases steadily. In addition, it becomes the low birthrate and aging society because a lot of people who marry after getting old do not make children. Population of Japan decreases steadily as now, and I think that I lose the power as the country. I work hard at the making of child, and it is necessary to attach the power of a young generation.  When I read this article, I thought that this was a serious problem. When the ratios of elderly person increase in Japan;the nation's economic prospects depend on making them productive. However, actually there are few places where the elderly can work by resignation and so on. I think that the government should think about the making of environment and the pension policy once again because the aged society will worsen more in the future.  It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. I agree with it's thought. Work place is important especially for elderly people in that they can have connections with many people. Retirement causes for some people not only poor but also isolation from society. Now in Japan, the system of social welfare is bankrupted, and the number of elderly people's suicides are increasing. To offer them their jobs may become one solution to solve these problems, I think.  The environment where elderly people can do work is required. (quotation from comments) I agree with this opinion. Many aged Japanese have more knowledges and experiences than young people, so  they can work to support or educate their next generation. In addition, I think people who work for something are very lively, in fact, 80-year-old my grandfather is now worker and live happily. 60 years old is not so weak and old actually. Of course, there are people who don't work anymore over aged 60, I suggest that elderly chose whether they continue to work or not when they become the present retire year. In the future, Japanese security services will be more powerless, so reforming work environment is the best way for nation as one of the developed aging countries.  I think the cooperation between generations is important to overcome this problem. The current social security system won't be sustainable because the system is based on plentiful young labor force and high economic growth. The number of young people is on the decrease while the number of elderly people who retired from their jobs are on the increase. It's means tax income reduces while the cost of social security increases. What is worse, the long lasting recession has already multiplied the public debt. Japanese government finances is now on the verge of collapse. So it indeed inevitable that the rate of consumption tax is raised and the age when a person can receive a pension is delayed. But I believe we can take other measures in community. Some women are afraid that they have to quit their jobs if they have children and put off starting families even though they want to. Then, some elderly people have much experience of raising children and if they can help the mother bring up their children, more young women feel at ease and decide to have children. And some elderly people want to work but they can't get jobs because they are likely to get sick. Then, if young people do the jobs in place of them, more of them can be employed. In conclusion, young generation and elderly generation need help each other in order to get through this problem.  I think this problem is caused by long term depression. Young people do not afford to have their children. Even though you blame them for the origin of declining number of children and aging society, I argue that the government failed in stimulative measures is to blame too.  It is inevitable for all humans to age. An aging society must come to Japan in the future. We have to take measures to deal with the situation. I also agree with ID12028's opinion. Unless the number of children increases suddenly and mysteriously, we need elderly people to work. And, maybe we should consider immigrants for the workforce. For example, some Filipina tried to become nurses in Japan and obtained certification. This is based on EPA between Japan and the Philippines. As a result, they failed and went back to home. The arguments about this issue should be activated. In order to solve the root of this problem, the government needs to enact a law to urge nations to have a baby. I think that the tax deduction for medical expenses is one of the effective measures.  The environment where elderly people can do work is required. Like ID12028, I agree this opinion. Young people tend to be DINKS these days. So the trend that the number of elderly people increases and the number of people who support elderly people decreases has progressed. Therefore it is important for elderly people to be equipped to live by their own. It may be difficult for elderly people to start new jobs or acquire some techniques, so I think that it is important to prepare a suitable environment that elderly people can continue their jobs and apply what they have experienced.  I think that this problem will happen. In order to maintain the economy of Japan, Japanese government and laws allow elderly people to work longer if they want to work more. The population of young people in Japan is getting smaller, so the economy would not be supported by young people only. We need to think about this problem seriously.  I think it's ludicrous to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future. Adjusting pension benefits based upon age would also be appropriate in my opinion. If someone retires at 60, give them 60% of their benefits, 65, let's say 80% and at 70 everyone gets 100% of their benefits. I disagree with the opinion. Of course, there are even people who are over 60 years old and are able to work. But the Japanese economy is in a recession. Also the rate of employment in Japan has been decreasing for the past several years. So now many young people cannot get a job even if they are graduated from university. But if government adopted this system, more and more people cannot get a job. This is because the number of employment is more decreasing due to older people staying their office. People who are over 60 years old can choose whether they work their office or retire the job and receive a pension. So they have luxury choice. But if young people failed to get a job, they cannot earn a live. most of them will get a part-time job. But their lives are unstable. Moreover, if they have already been graduated from university, they will lose the chance of get a full-fledged employee. Such society is unfair. Therefore, we should turn our attention to the problem of difficulty of getting a job for young people.  I think government should consider about it more seriously. I think elderly people should have a chance to work if they can because there are a lot of elderly people in Japan and it is increasing every year. If there are more workers, economic would be active because government don't have to pay much for over sixty-year-old people who can earn money to live. Furthermore, I believe some young people should work harder because I heard the NEET population is growing. They rely on their parents. It wouldn't be good. I think that that's one of the reason why they can't get enough money to have a baby.  I think this is very serious problem in Japan. Increasing the percentage of elderly people cause economic stagnation. So government needs to have a solution for that. Japan tend to retire when they got 60 or 65. I think employer needs to hire them only if they still have ability to work.  I think aging population is a problem we cannot avoid from in nearly future in Japan but because many elder people were keen to work, I think Japan should abolish the retiring age system and change it to open-ended system so many people can work until they are satisfied.  It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. I agree with this opinion. Elderly people retire their job and there is few people who succeed to great technologies that are proud of Japan. Technologies are disappearing little by little, but certainly. That is so regrettable. And retired elderly people who has worked earnestly for a long time become more likely to be Alzheimer by having no reasons for living. I have heard that, and my acquaintances, for example my friends' grandfather and grandmother, was also so. Opportunities to work give elderly people reasons for living.  I think this is an important problem for Japan's future. It may be easy for companies to employ elder people, because elder people have already had the skills to work. They have experiences and intuitions which can be used in working. However, if companies employ young people, a lot of money would be necessary to educate them. I understand their thought, but it is young people that will support Japan in the future. The skills, experiences, and intuitions have to be conveyed the next ages. To solve this problem, the government should help companies to employ more young people, including us!! The environment where elderly people can do work is required.  : I think in the same way. I guess there are a lot of the elderly people who want to come back to jobs but do not have the opportunity. For most part-time jobs, young men is in great demand. I suggest public institutions should voluntary create new employment for the elderly such as a clerk, and a guard in a public facility. My city has ""silver jinzai center"", the main aim of which is that people over 60 years old will register for it, and will be sent to the city's facility as labor force. Until now, I think , it has worked successfully. Therefore, I suppose if more and more public institutes should found their own centers like that, the situation will get improved.  I think that Japan have to solve the problem. If Japan can solve the problem , Japan may be the leading country. China will be the same situation soon. Japan's model how to solve aging society give any aging society hope.  I think it is necessary to increase labor force as much as we could. However, I think to hire aging is not a good solution to solve the problem we are facing. I heard at least 1/4 of people who graduate university couldn't get a job. I think it's because aging don't give up their seat. Many workers feel the circumstance that aging occupy their seat, usually those are high rank, is bad for their company. Workers said that they are hard-headed and inflexible. I think it's important to let younger people to get a seat in company, not keep aging who can't get along with company.  I'm strongly disagree with this comment because I think it's not good idea to let aged people stay in company. I think that is our last choice and I think we have more ways to increase labor force. First of all, there are many younger people who are willing to work. It's important to let them experience how economy goes, because they are people who would support Japan longer than aged people. Let aged people work is good for now, but it cause less chance for younger to have a same experience. If we let aged people work, and when they died, people who are left is not experienced people only. If we really want to let Japan stay longer, than I think we need to let younger to work, than aged people.  I think we have to make more old people to work and earn money by them self and stop them relying on pension. Decreasing numbers of working people can not afford increasing number of old people and we have to change the society to get on with this problem.  I think that it is a huge serious problem that we all Japanese people should think about and find a strategy. For me, as 20 years old at the moment, I am worried about the incoming future we will be facing. It will be absolutely difficult for us to have such increasing number of elderly. Even though they are putting off their retirement and trying to work longer and remain active, there is a limit. This problem is most likely to affect the economic of the whole country and we are under pressure that we have to support the old people.  After reading this news, I was very shocked. For solution, I thought that the old people should be easily hired to work if they want. By doing this, there may some benefit. In case working with young people like teenagers, the old people may teach the experience they have got from their long life and stimulate the young people. I do not think this is the problem, but it is a chance to get our age developed.  I strongly disagree with his opinion especially ""I I heard at least 1/4 of people who graduate university couldn't get a job. I think it's because aging don't give up their seat. Many workers feel the circumstance that aging occupy their seat, usually those are high rank, is bad for their company. "" I think people who graduate university couldn't get a job because they didn't effort enough. I think most young students are lazy during school life. I bet they could do harder if they really want to get a job.  I disagree with this comment. I think that we should not make elderly people possible to work for a long period. There is one reason. Making elderly people possible to work for a long time causes to make short of opportunities of working for young people. So I think that young labor population should be larger.  I think that this situation is very serious problem. Because keeping to increase people aged 65 or over will lead too heavy a burden for young people who are going to work in the future. Such a hard situation may discourage young people from working.  Thanks to the development of technology, the average lifetime of Japanese has continued to extend. However, most of the elderly people now do not have job because of the retirement. I don't agree with this system. We should not force them to retire depending on decided age, we should allow them to keep working if they are healthy and able to work. Now there are a lot of senile people BECAUSE they do not work and use their brain and once they get senile, it seems to be difficult for them to make it again. In addition, few companies are likely to hire elderly people because elderly people are thought to be short memorized. I know it's very impolite expression but most of the people think like that somewhere in their mind. That's why I think they should continue to work so that they won't get senile. If they don't get senile, they can be very productive using their great knowledge and experience.  It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an ""open end"" retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society. Japan needs to change. I agree with this opinion. Nowadays, people aged 60 or over are still active, and many of them do volunteer work or so energetically. I think that the right time to retire depends on each person. Some of them want to keep on working after they retired. Others think that they want to enjoy the rest of their life. In this way, I think it is not a government job to tell people when to retire.  Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder. I mostly agree with this opinion. al welfare but It's true that Japan is now in a huge debt and there should be some way to solve this problem. Also, I agree with the idea of increasing working population and governments should formulate realizable policy of social welfare but I don't think encouraging young people to word harder will be a good measure. Young workers already have too heavy burden on their back because of our ""pension"" system. I guess another measure that do not force young people to work harder will be needed.  This is one of the biggest problems in Japan. Because of bad Japanese economy, many young people can't get new jobs, get homes, and have a family. Also they don't try to make their children. This bad economy causes bad results in the future. I think Japanese government should submit the new amendment which can help money for studying or medical treatments for children. This needs much money for government, but this cost will connect with bright future in Japan.  I think it's ludicrous to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future. If people want to retire that's one thing, however if they don't, or if they need to keep working then let them do so. I agree with this opinion. I also think it doesn't have to ""force"" people to retire at age 60. It is good thing for the new comers to work with the veteran who have more knowledge or more experiences. And probably, the people who want to continue to work though they are 60 have high motivation. I think it makes companies be better.  This news is related to us, too. Nowadays, even young people are keen to work, but there are few job opportunities. I don't know what to do for a declining birthrate and aging populations. So I want to do what I must do now.  This is very big problem in this country. Honestly, I don't know how to deal with this problem. But I guess the way to solve this problem is create jobs the opportunity should be given for elderly person. If they continue to work more 5 years, the situation may be better.  It is said that Japan will become aging society and declining birth rate. Experts indicate some causes of that. When I read some opinions, I feel that a provision for aging society requires a policy of the government. Japan is a backward country about support for people who does child raising and work. And, Japanese pension plan begins to decline. The government has great power. So, I think the government should do some policies. But, I don't think it is enough. Japanese style of systems won't obtain soon by changes of society. So, Japanese people should seek new systems by learning various countries.  Aging has been a big problem for a long time in Japan, and it is obvious that we must deal with this matter. If nation's prospects are correct, young people will bear too heavy a burden and aging people won't be able to receive enough pension to live on. But this problem is difficult to solve. I think a solution that is shown in this article is good. But that is not practical because realizing a society where elderly people can work is not easy in this situation. Now, even young people who graduated from university take trouble to get a job. So I think many corporations can't afford to accept elderly people. We may not have the clear solution. But no doubt all of us must share part of the burden in some ways to tackle this difficult problem.  The article speaks about the shrinking of the labor force. However, I think this kind of problem can be solved with making working place convenient to elderly. I think the most effective way for making the workplace convenient for the elderly is work sharing. According to a business dictionary, work sharing is a Method used for reducing operating costs without laying off employees. In work sharing schemes, working hours and wages are cut across the board until the organization's finances return to normal levels. The company can then work towards employing elderly. In this case, elderly can work more effectively because they can maintain work-life balance. Using this method, the elderly's hope for working can fulfilled. Furthermore, this method is effective for solving problems with low birth rate and so on. Many females put off having babies because of their work. However, with this method, Females can continue working in this style until their babies have grown up enough, and males can help infant care. These are my opinions on elderly society.  I think, it is so seriously problem for Japan. This article said, many old people want to work. It is same as young people. So many young people want to get job, but there are not plenty of job. People couldn't get job often lost home, some of them starve to death. And, there is a problem of pension. Nowadays, few young people support many old people. This system is on the verge of collapse about to fall apart. If these problems weren't resolved, Japan would collapse .  I think aging society is the most serious problems in Japan. A few young people must help a lot of old people. This situation must not work any more. So Japan must establish new welfare system. Japan have great deal of debt in the world. Aging society is the reason of Japan's debt. Politicians must be hurry to establish new welfare system.  Aging society is not avoidable. I think Japan should act for declining birth rate than for aging because we can't control the timing of people's death. So, I think also Japan has many debt and will be bankrupt unless Japanese government manage to declining birth rate.   The environment where elderly people can do work is required. I agree to this opinion. The reasons are as given below. First, feeling being needed can be what makes life worth living. Second, when a trend towards fewer children, being more workforce is essential to retain at least current economic power. So, I think it important elderly people to have more opportunity to get jobs.  This news tells us serious problems. We must face them in near feature. Aging society in not avoidable for Japan. So it is very important to think how to deal with it well . At the same time, we should build the society that young people can have baby easier.  I don't think this news is the problem in the future. we are responsible for this serious problem. We should manage somehow and find a solution of the birth rate declining and the population aging, unemployment problem. Otherwise business activity goes bad and people living in Japan will have difficulty making a living.  It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an open end"" retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society. . Japan needs to change. "" The comment above is from the link to the news story. I agree with the idea that the individual freedom choice of when to retire should be entrusted to oneself. It is true that more Japanese elderly people is eager to work and Japan is in need of more workers. We should also think of people who do not want to work longer. There are some people who want to retire at the age of 60. So the government should stop telling people when to retire and entrust the choice to each individual. From another point of view, it is not always good to elderly people to keep on working especially in the big companies. This is because elderly extension of working will result in less adoption of young people. It is also important to improve the current situation of unemployment. Anyway, ""Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060"" is imminent issue to Japan, so the Japanese government should try every possible means to stop the society from aging and come up with the idea to increase children.  I think this fact is very serious problem. Present Japan is aging society, so to increase elderly people is dangerous problem. I think growing the opportunity that aging people get their job should be conducted immediately.  Before I leave this comment, I read the other comments above. There are many opinion about the retirement age problem. They say that the system should be abolished and the elderly people should work active after 65. The aging people have more capacities for the work than young people, so they can contribute to the society. I agree with these comments. But I think there are something to do before the abolishment is done. If the elderly people continue to work more, some changes in the workplace is required. People will have difficulties about their bodies as they became older and the companies that they work have to have consideration with their problem like this. To stop the retirement age , we should think ""What is needed for the society which the elderly people work comfortably?"".  Japan is now aging rapidly so it is necessary for the government to deal with the problem. Someone commented on this blog that it is not the government that decides when to retire, partly I agree with the idea, but I also think that it is the necessary thing for the government to decide it as one of the model for the companies. That way, people will realize how to deal with the problem efficiently? The point is, government needs to show us the model.  I agree with this opinion, but it has a big problem. The problem is that the employment opportunities for young people may be reduced in exchange for the ones for elderly people. Please try to think who will make our future world. Before everything, we should promote the employment for young people, i think.  I think it is good to raise the age of retirement to 70 or elder. Increase of elder people cannot be stopped any more, so companies should positively employ elder people. Besides, if the number of working elder people increase, income of pension also increases.  I absolutely agree. It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. This is Alan's opinion, I agree with this opinion mainly. Japan has many old people, and it will be kind for them, it is impossible I think. Japanese old people can live and work very long. So in lives, Japanese people should work something.  I agree the opinion. In Japan, It is self-evident that number of children will decrease and the aged will increase. This is a big problem we and industrialized countries in the world cannot avoid. So, Japan should become a model case.  I think this problem is complicated. If elderly people can participate in the labor market, they will be great labor force. Actually, In Japan, the system like this were proposed, that often called ""re-employment system"". However, some people point the problem of this system. The problem is that the system will be dangerous to press the employment of young people. So it would not result in success if the retirement age were raised.  If there are more elder people, it will be more inconvenient. Getting fewer children will be unable to pay an enough tax for elder people. Getting more elder people will be unable to receive an enough pension. Therefore, the nation should improve the welfare. For example, a maternity leave will be installed every company, the government support families which have more than 2 children, it will reduce a cost for schools and so on. I think it is the most important for young families to carry out these systems. In short, I want the government to improve welfare which can be made children without difficulties.  ID12011 can consider this problem objectively and study from another angle. And his view is much to the point! So I strongly agree with his comment.  I am afraid of an aging society.  This news is related to us, too. Nowadays, even young people are keen to work, but there are few job opportunities. I don't know what to do for a declining birthrate and aging populations. So I want to do what I must do now.  I agree with this comment. Because I think the corporation is the most important to overcome aging problems. A few years ago, children helped their parents. But, children can not help their parents today. So there are need to rely on the social security. The cost of social security is enormous. So Japan is the country which have a lot of debts. Now that social security system is collapsing. So we have to corporate.  I disagree with this opinion. This is because this comment say that aging people should work harder. I feel this opinion heartless. There may be another settlement of the aging society. For example, we make Japanese government to receive immigrants more and more. So young foreigner would come Japan and work hard. And They may leave more offspring than Japanese and the percentage of attendance would improve.  I agree with this opinion. Many aged Japanese have more knowledges and experiences than young people, so they can work to support or educate their next generation. In addition, I think people who work for something are very lively, in fact, 80-year-old my grandfather is now worker and live happily. 60 years old is not so weak and old actually. Of course, there are people who don't work anymore over aged 60, I suggest that elderly chose whether they continue to work or not when they become the present retire year. In the future, Japanese security services will be more powerless, so reforming work environment is the best way for nation as one of the developed aging countries.  I think it is important to think Japanese future, too. Japan has a lot of problems that we have to solve. Many people in Japan don't expect the government policy any more. So, I think young people should think the future.  Japan should be aging countermeasure. Otherwise Japan collapse in the near future.  It is amazing news. Too much of elderly people is a serious worry for nations in every respect. Therefore government should search away out of that. In addition, ordinary people, especially young should try to improve that. Otherwise they will be suffered from various problems.  When I read this article, I thought that this was a serious problem. When the ratios of elderly person increase in Japan;the nation's economic prospects depend on making them productive. However, actually there are few places where the elderly can work by resignation and so on. I think that the government should think about the making of environment and the pension policy once again because the aged society will worsen more in the future.  I agree with this opinion. Because it is true that young people number is decreasing and labor force is shrinking but the number of the elderly will be demanded now and future.  I agree with this opinion. If those who want to work should just work all the time. Moreover their experience is required for society. Furthermore, a pension is needed when it retires early. It presses the Japanese economy. Therefore, the pension of past 60 years old should also work I dis agree with this comment. Because there is tradition in Japan. When many woman work, housekeeping stops realizing. I think that man and woman, s division of roles that it is the right form of Japan.  I think if elderly was working at good position, young will not work at good position. So I think elderly retire as soon as possible.  I agree with him because he consider the social factor in this case. In addition, he analysis the feelings of families of both victim and suspect.  Actually, elderly people in Japan, much people wants to work with proper pay, they require money which can back up their lives. No matter how many elderly people increase in future life, an amount of payment toward to elderly people will not surpass an amount of production which elderly people make.  If there a time to grow, there is a time when its decline. I think this process is a part of an earth's self-purification. Because I thought Japan's future is fearful since birth rate has decreasing. Japan Government have to make a method to increase birth rate and increase labor age in the far future.  The environment where elderly people can do work is required.  Like ID12028, I agree this opinion. Young people tend to be DINKS these days. So the trend that the number of elderly people increases and the number of people who support elderly people decreases has progressed. Therefore it is important for elderly people to be equipped to live by their own. It may be difficult for elderly people to start new jobs or acquire some techniques, so I think that it is important to prepare a suitable environment that elderly people can continue their jobs and apply what they have experienced.  I also think that NEET rely on their parents and this situation is bad. We should look at our social system.  I am afraid about Japanese future. So, I agree with this comment. I also think that Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder.  In today's Japan we are faced with dual-ongoing problems, the aging society caused by longer life expectancy and lower birth-rate. On top of these problems, we are also in the serious economic recession. I think the fundamental problem is coming from decreasing number of working population. One of the way to cope with this situation, in my idea, is just to make full use of working power by women and the older age. It is important for us to prepare the suitable working condition so that they can work easily and happily. I believe this is one good solution to the problems.  I sympathize because she worry about aging society too. And I think her idea of growing the opportunity that aging people get their job is good idea.  She said it is not good that old people work after retire. However I think it is very effective for Japanese economy. So I disagree with her.  I have the the same opinion about elderly to work.  I think elderly people have a lot of experience and wisdom, so Japanese society can use their power. At the same time, that is reasonable to Japan's economy. I think they should work if they can.  There is no way other than the plan.  When I was heard news, I think that it is very seriously problem for Japan for government. I read some opinions, I think that the old man should work. If they are healthy, they don't need to retire their job.  Having read this article, i worried about Japan's future. Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060 the article said. Young people including me, of course don't want to pay tax only for elderly. Tax payment will heavily task young people's living due to increasing elderly pension. I want to use my money for myself but I also have to pay tax. So, I should earn lot of money and study how to decrease my tax payment to be happy.  I do not think we can avoid this problem with aging society and low fertility and if I can come up with a great idea to solve it, I think someone else has probably come up with it. But I do agree to the fact that many people are working for too long and this leads to poor employment rates.  I think governments and company should support elderly people who wants to work more. My grandmother still works 5 days a week even though she is 74. And because she goes to work she has lots of friends and shares her hobby with them. Compered to her, my grand father quit his job long time ago. He stays at house all day and has no one to talk with. Now he has doubt that he has Alzheimer's disease. I think that if he could keep working more he wouldn't have got disease.  I don't think we need to be apprehensive that lack of labor force makes Japan fall national power. Because industrial robots will make up lack of labor force. However, it's not mean that we can take a rosy view. Japanese government will not collect a lot of tax. Japan's pension scheme might unravel. I think Japanese government must consider its plans.  I think this article shows a serious problem in Japan and is related to all of us. The more elderly people are increased, the more responsibilities we must have. Thus, if elderly people want a job, government should help them to seek a job and solve a problem with entire country. This situation will not be changed if there are no help of the government.  I think this is very serious problem. The number of people aged 65 is increasing these days. So young people has many serious problems about tax and care for the aged. I think a solution to this problems is increase the number of children. To increase it, we should make an environment which easy to give birth. And the government should make a policy. Probably it will take many time. But I think someday the number will increase. I'm worry about Japan's future very much. we should do something to solution this problem.  I had known that older people in Japan were increasing, but I didn't imagine that it would reach 0.4 in 2060. I think that Japanese government should immediately make a policy which companies must hire motivated older people. Also, it must act for young people. Reducing public debt, they don't need to be afraid of their future and can happily think about having their babies. I hope Japanese economy will recover as soon as possible.  I think this is one of the most important problem in Japan. Aging population and decreasing number of children will cause declining economy power. And young people will have to hold heavy tax for pensions. We should think how we create the society that the aged can keep to work and many families can get some baby. Young people have to save money for life in their old age because they will be able not to receive pensions.  An aging society is big problem for Japanese society. I think two plans. We have to make our society very convenient for elderly people. And we should conduct the employment adjustment. And I think the Japanese government have to think about accepting immigration. In the future, we have to cooperate with the immigration. Though if the immigration increases, the friction will increases. But for the Japanese future we should accept the immigration and cooperate with them.  I think this is a very complicated problem. In Japan, as the birthrate declines and the population ages, the population of people aged 65 or over is increasing. So Japan's social power may decline because there will be more old people who spend on social security than young people who participate social economic activities. However, long life is our dream. From these reasons, I think this problem is very complicated. Then, I think we should consider two problems that young people these days put of starting families and they have few children than before. A declining birth rate and aging population is not only our problem but also our future's problem, so I think it is important to consider deeply and live having consciousness that we are the member of our society.  I think this problem is very serious. I think Japan government should change system about elderly.  We have something to do with this serious problem. We must support a lot of people aged 65 until retire from our own job. In addition, there is no sure proof that I can get pension for declining birth rate. I think this problem is too complicated for Japan's government to solve.  The young give up having babies because of the current environment. First, it is recession. Since the young are worried about their income, they are unwilling to have babies. Second, it is about child-care leave. Since it is difficult for them to get a job again, they tend not to have babies. As the population of aging people increase, the young have responsibility to support aging people. I think that government should control the surroundings to increase the population of the young.  I think this problem is one of the most important issues in Japan. Japanese government should take steps. Otherwise Japan cannot grow any more.  I think the fact which aging people increasing will be not changed and the fact will serious influence on Japanese economy. Even if aging people or retiree can get an opportunity to work, their productivity will be low. But I think Japan will have to depend on the work force of the elderly because of the declining birthrate.  This news's opinion is that the society is a way of thinking to let elderly to account work. As a result of this news, I thought that I must give job opportunities in more elderly to account. This problem is very serious and is the problem that should be settled.  The aging of Japan is remarkable, so I think that Japanese government should take measures. Especially I think think that Japanese government should hold a retirement age in particular because it contributes that debts of Japan of increase that people paying a tax decrease.  I think this is a difficult problem, and Japanese government should consider it more serious. People can find meaning in life by working. People can feel pleasure and make friends by working. So if a retired person wants to work, a country should give him job opportunities. Nowadays, the population of young people is decreased. We shouldn't forget our society is supported by elderly people.  I feel that this problem is very serious and Japanese government must think the way to revitalize Japanese economic more. And I think its government had better give an opportunity for job to aging people who want to work because it is not absolute that labor force of aging people is inferior to that of young people.  I think this problem is so serious. Not only Japanese government but also we ourselves must give this problem more careful consideration. We are involved in this matter. First of all, in order to solve this problem, we have reconsider about a tendency to marry later. It can bring about a declining birth rate. Young people tend to think that it is not easy to marry and bring up children. It is partly because of unfavorable employment conditions. We have to improve labor conditions. Secondary, we have to suggest new type of company or job that elderly people can easily work for. For example, I think that elderly women can work as baby-sitters because most of them has an experience of child care when they were young mother. As stated above, we can do a lot of things to solve this problem.  I think this problem is very difficult. Some older people can work more, but other people cannot do it because of illness and so on. My grandmother lives on a pension, and she doesn't work. I have never think of her working more, and, to tell the truth, I hope she doesn't do. But, their annuity is covered by our tax! I don't want to work them, but young people are decreasing. It is really serious problem.  Aging problem is serious in Japan now. Elderly people is increasing. I think working problem is the most difficult. What elderly people need is the measures to those who can work and who cannot work because of their illness.  When I read this article, I thought this problem was very serious and it had to do with medical development and improving the health service. This is very difficult problem s. Those developments are of course needed by everyone. Nobody wouldn't like to live. However, it will cost government to continue them. Also young people will have to pay more tax. We should consider what we do.  I think aging problem is very serious because the burden on each young person will increase more and more in terms of the pension, the insurance and some kinds of tax which are used for elderly people. It means decline of Japanese economy that young people supporting the economy are pressed.  I think that this aging problem in Japan is so serious. The government of Japan values the elderly people's lives , but don't help young people. I suppose that Japanese government should assist young people more than elderly people , because the young have the future.  The young have the future, but elderly people have it too. So your idea is difficult to come true. And the government helps us a little.  I agree with you. There are many elderly people who can work even if they are over 60 years old. If government allow them to work for a long period, dept of Japan will be decreased even a little. Japanese government should think about this problem for our future.  I agree with your opinion very strong. People in Japan have to be dealt equally. So the government and some administration will not help your plan.  I think so too. Too many elderly people can be problem. It affects young people. I suppose that the increasing of young people is related to economy growing.  I agree with your opinion. I think Japanese young people have to supporting the economy. "
JOC JOC-12B-04N 1.61 "I think that EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. It is too early. It is the truth that EU was established for keeping out any wars and this purpose has been fulfilled for 60 years. However we must not forget that EU also holds some countries which suffer for the financial crisis. In fact, we can see a lot of demonstrators in these countries. EU should strive to solve this issue before being awarded the Prize, or peace in EU will not be kept for a long time.  I think the award is just joke because EU caused depressions from Greece and it leads the world to bad world. I think America and Japan also keep the peace. I agree eurosceptics.  I disagree with the Nobel peace prize's winner of this year. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be admitted to be peaceful by people all over the world. But this case, people even in the EU criticizes about the prize, such as eurosceptics. Moreover the word of ""peace"" ought to have the only one meaning, so I believe these wide way of thinking about recipient is wrong.  I think Nobel Prize should be sent to individuals rather than organization. Sometimes many people contribute to common feat together and it's hard to decide who is the best and deserved. As a result, an organization not an individual is awarded. But this decision may not do good to both those who were involved in the feat and the idea of Nobel Prize itself. Firstly, individuals' achievements were hidden by too broad and vague achievement of an organization. For instance, EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace is made up of many individuals' achievements such as breaking the dictatorship. Even if EU awards the Nobel Prize, they cannot attract people's attention. Their feats may not be revealed to people in the world. On the contrary, If a individual awards the Nobel Prize, at least one of their achievements is in the spotlight. Secondary, some organizations utilize Nobel Prize as a propaganda to boost their confidence. Policy of a country is one of the most polarizing issues and many people may not agree to the award. In reality, some praise the EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace while other criticize it even in the member of the EU. And in such a situation, the organizations are only self-satisfied with the award. So I believe Nobel Prize should go to only individuals.  Like other people said, I think EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. They were given the prize because they had no war for 60 years, but I think there are other countries where they don't have war for longer than 60 years. Also, like some people mentioned, EU is the one who lead Economic Crisis. There were lot of demos toward government. I'm not so sure that leading Economic Crisis and Demos are ""Peace. "" Also, some people said that Prize should be given to independent, but I think organization also have right to earn the Prize.  I don't think EU deserves Nobel Peace Prize. Though it's admirable that EU had no war for 60 years, we should not say that only such a thing is required for Peace. Because of the recent world wide depression, many people and countries are suffering from financial problem. European countries are some of the most struggling countries in the world. Due to this problem, it's easily assumable that people are loosing their jobs. How can we call that such countries peaceful? I agree with ID12063's comment. I do not think that EU deserves the prize. The prize was given because European countries had no war for 60 years, but I think it is strange because we must not cause a war any more. Therefore, it does not matter whether 60 years have passed. We do not care about that how many years we live without war. We just need to think about not causing a war again.  I don't think that EU deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize because 60 years of peace in Europe is not special. WWII damaged Europe seriously. Therefore EU didn't have plenty of energy left over for starting new war.  As other people had said, I don't think EU suits to Nobel Peace Prize. Keeping out war is a thing that must be done everywhere around the world and it is not a special thing. There are still many problems are happening in Europe countries and they have to correspond to these problems.  I think this is not worthy to recognize. I agree the Nobel Peace Prize only go to individuals. This recognition look like a performance of politics. And, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should only go to individuals because the Nobel Peace Prize go to a person who contributes to the peace of the world. If the frame of government receive the prize, this means criticizing the others. And, this will connect a thought which winner is always right.  Shameful talk, I didn't know that EU have won the Nobel Peace Prize. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should not only go to individuals but also to organization and so on, because Peace can be protected by everyone. So it's difficult to won the Nobel Peace Prize, but I want to do something for world peace.  Some critics say the reason why EU got the award of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize is that it will encourage European countries to tackle with the difficulties they are facing now, such as economic crisis. There's no denying that it is a good thing to encourage individuals or organizations to strive hard, but is there any justification for the Nobel Peace Prize to do so? I don't think so. Nobel Peace Prize should be separate from the political or economical matter happening in the country or in the world. They should focus only on whether the deed of the actor is appropriate for being commended. Using this argument, I also disagree with when President Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize in the matter of contribution to the peace of Afghanistan. He hasn't really done anything to the peace of Afghanistan ( some say he made Afghanistan more dangerous place) and at this time the prize was awarded just as an encouragement as well. So what I would like to say is that I certainly agree with the fact that some EU countries have contributed to settle down some of the conflicts they had, it was just an outcome of the history, and there's no justification and it is unfair for EU to achieve the prize because while individual or NGO activists routinely make sacrifices and take huge risks to do make the peaceful world, EU are paid to do so.  I am not an European, but Japanese, therefore I do not understand what affairs EU is now confronted with, and what it has really brought Europe. I have so poor knowledge that I am not able to express my opinion about this issue. I have to learn more about it. Anyway I do not care whether Nobel Peace Prize should go to such institutions as EU, or individuals. As Mario Monti says, the prize, I hope, will encourage EU to overcome the current economic difficulties.  I like EU, so I was happy when I was heard the news EU got the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, I can understand some critics against this incident, but you can't deny the role of EU for peace in Europe. The cooperation between many countries, as EU has done, is very important for achieving the international peace, I think. What EU did is precious the ""history"". We have to learn them, both good things and bad things.  In the first place, the Nobel Prize is awarded to the best of contributor in the each field. In other words, this prize is awarded to the person. Nobel  thought that this prize should be awarded regardless of countries and nations. But is this winning prize against Nobel's will? So I think that the Nobel Prize is awarded to the person not to the organization. Furthermore, I have some doubts about this winning the prize. One of the doubts is the reason why EU is awarded the Nobel Prize. The reason why the EU is awarded is that, as the article written, the EU in recognition of 60 years without war and for encouraging EU governments and people to press forward, ""overcoming the current economic difficulties. "" But it is strange. Firstly, most of democratic countries haven't made wars since WWII. EU side will talk about the relationship between France and Germany especially. But there were tense situation between countries such as Japan and China. Both countries also haven't gone to war. Secondly, winning the prize is strange for only overcoming the economic crisis. First of all, economy is not related to the Piece. And also there were a lot of countries which are facing the crisis. This award is against Nobel's will that should not support a part of countries. For these reasons I disagree with this award.  I don't think that EU deserved Nobel Peace Prize. The reason of that is, no matter what people say, the present economic depressions. And I think EU's idea of integration is great, of course, but I don't think just the idea have worth of the prize. Not only that, this reception would let the value of the prize down and make me think that it is a desperate election. Sometimes, there were the years of no recipient of the prize. Causing these problems, I think not electing was better than electing forcibly.  I agree that the EU was given the nobel prize. It is because there are still some wars all over the world, these days the number of the wars have been reducing, though. Many classmates disagree with this news, but I do not think so. Anything that keep a peace should be praised. I believe that the peace of the whole world is the most important thing that every people should hope. In short, the nobel  organization should give the nobel peace prize to a lot of plans, organizations, and association.  I disagree with the nobel peace prize of this year. Surely it is wonderful to keep being without war for 60 years. However it is a part of the EU. The EU also have bad aspects, for example economic crisis. Moreover the nobel prize should be given to only individuals, because prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics.  I do not disagree with the fact that EU has awarded the Nobel peace prize of 2012. Some says it is not appropriate to give such a prize to the organization, but why? I think there is no doubt that the EU has contributed to keep the peace of the European continent. Think about the past! There had been wars in every generations! But, now? no more war. Is there any doubt that it has not contributed to achieve such a great thing? I agree with the nobel peace prize for EU. I think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize. EU accomplish its purpose properly. I expect that this prize will make a sense of unity stronger, and function to improve the economic crises.  I think this collision is being come by the absence of standard of prizing Nobel Peace Prize. Actually, it is hard to establish a standard of Peace Prize. Because Peace can be thought as both comprehensive and microscopic. However, in my personal opinion, I think the Nobel Peace Prize have to be prized by a standard based on microscopic viewpoint. Nobody would be awarded if presenting the Peace Prize based on comprehensive since there are no people who had not made a fault in their lives. Therefore, EU deserved to prize the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think Nobel Peace Prize is given the man who proposed and caught out the idea which has a possibility to make everyone happy. Its aim isn't for everyone, the importance is to make many people happy, and need not any sacrifices. Now, EU can't resolve the problem of poverty, the society which can make a part of people happy is not really happy I think.  I do not think the EU deserves the nobel prize as many students complaining above. They said that the EU was kept without war for 60 years. This should be appreciated, but they caused terrible problem at the same time. The depression we are struggling with now is actually caused from one of the countries of the EU. To receive the prize, they should have solved the problem and been perfect.  I can't understand why EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think that EU contributed peace of world. On the contrary, EU confused the world economy by financial crisis. But, I agree organization are awarded Nobel Prize. Because, I think many kind of method for peace have to be evaluated.  I think it is unconvinced that EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think EU didn't contribute peace of world entirely, but it is abstract and i don't understand how EU contribute.  I think it is important to cooperate with other people to tackle some problems. But once the group became powerful, people in it apt to think their own profit. I don't think that is just. We should be careful not being so.  No war for 60 years in Europe is valuable. But I don't know this is worth awarding as a Nobel Peace Prize. That because I can't understand the criterion of awarding . I think some people are worth awarding it, but others which I didn't think they had done enough services award it. So I think the value of the Nobel Peace Prize is getting less.  As many eurosceptics said, this nobel peace prize for EU may exaggerate it's achievements. If the prize winner was an individual, we could see a consistent policy or so. But a big organization as EU, people can't be sure which to focus on it's accomplishments. The Nobel  committee should show more concrete reason for people assent for it.  many people disagrees about eu winning the nobel peace prize, but i think they should deserve one. as ID12048 said, no war for 60 years in eu is valuable thing so other countries should follow eu's example.  No war for 60 years is good. But, I felt strange that EU got a Nobel peace prize because, EU is not only a country that without war for 60 years. It not fair.  I think EU should not win the nobel peace prize because they are not ready enough. I think that the nobel peace prize should be given to the person who has completed it work which had made a good effect for world peace. These days, I think standard of the nobel prize is blurring. As I said, it should be given to the person who has completed the work. Not ti the person who has only started, like president Obama and Grameen Bank. I feel it is sad that the nobel prize is becoming something that doesn't mean anything.  I think EU don't deserve Nobel Peace Prize . It is not appropriate reason that EU recognition of 60 years with out war.  Like most students have written in their comments, I do not think it is appropriate for the EU to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, there is a fact that the economic crisis which the world is still suffering from was caused by one of the EU country. Also, I am not persuaded by the idea that they received the prize in recognition of 60 years without war. It is not quite fair for other countries which have kept their peace for more than 60 years and have caused any problems like the world depression.  I think the award of EU is not strange. I would like to show two the reason. First, there have been no war theses 60 years in EU, it is worth to being praised. I studied the world history in high school, so I can understand the difficulty to keep piece there. The history of Europe is the history of wars. So, when I think the fact, This situation without wars for 60 years is wonderful. Secondly, this prize implies to expect EU to fight this danger situation of EU. Now, EU has big financial problem with Greece. I think this Nobel Prize means that cheering EU to get over it.  I do not think it amusing that EU wins a Nobel Peace Prize . Because, EU is no-war for 60 years. Moreover, by having won the nobel peace prize, it is thought that the consciousness of the peace of EU will become strong from now on. Therefore, this award is good.  I think the award of EU is natural. the fact that there have been no war in 60 years is so admirable. Were it not for EU, big war among countries would've fired, I guess. so it's worth to be praised.  Once European countries had made war. But EU aimed stabilization of economy and developed a sense of camaraderie, and as a result, no war is going on in Europe. This is great thing, I think. Thinking of Asian countries' confrontation - such as China, North Korea, and Japan-EU's grappling is meaningful. However, not existence of war was brought not only by positive actions for peace but also by the natural course.  Congratulations EU! I think it is good thing that EU got nobel prize. Though EU have tremendous problems, EU have great meaning for future. Europe is mature place. So Europe must take point. Europe is in depression because of financial difficulties of Greece and Portugal. I think EU can great job.  I am for the eurosceptics. I think that EU took an important role in postwar confusion. But it should not be praised now. EU now has many problems such as economic difficulties, and it doesn't seem to have brought a peace to the world. So the award isn't deserved. Possibly the prize will encourage european people to press forward and solve the current problems. But it has nothing to do with the world peace too much. Important thing is what EU did, not what EU will do. Many people misunderstand the meaning of Nobel Peace prize.  In recent years, Nobel Peace Prize tends to be awarded as a hope to the winner's success of its future (for example, Obama was awarded shortly after he was inaugurated as President). Maybe it's the same thing this time. So I think it is not something to get angry.  I agree with ID12054 comment. I think EU doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. Because 60 years without war is a good point but, some countries in the EU have continued economic recession. There are a lot of unemployed. EU does not deserve the prize in economic . Too early to get a prize.  I disagree to the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, the EU's recognition of 60 years without war is really good, I think. But they forget the Cold War. After WW2, they struggled for their profits and many countries are suffered from WW2 and the Cold War. So, I think the EU should not won the Nobel Peaze Prize.  I think it is inappropriately that EU win Nobel Prize. Certainly no war has happened since 60 years ago, there is many problem now, so there is possibility the safety of EU become worse. Nobel Prize shouldn't be given EU, should be given individual who tried for EU peace.  I think the EU does not deserve the Nobel peace prize. It is true that countries in the EU strive to unify Europe to create a peaceful civil society and work together as a political experiment to become an example for settling peace in their countries; however, this cannot be a reason for Nobel peace prize. There are two reasons for this idea. Firstly, Alfred Nobel's will specified that the prize should be given to ""the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. "" But it is hard to say EU has promoted peace in other countries. Fundamentally, EU is an organization for the welfare of the people who are members of EU countries. It is true that European countries are at peace because of EU. But even though unification decreased war in Europe and made peace in the European area, EU eventually turned into a hegemony. For example, EU disregarded the demands of help from Burmese pro-democracy activists many times. They requested help from the EU because dictatorship in Burma was worsening and international society did not see the gravity of the situation even though a lot of Burmese citizens were killed or sent to prison. But EU also disregarded that problem. Also, EU is responsible for destroying the Bamyan Buddha. In 2003, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha, with the intention of appealing to international society to accept their political will and wish to negotiate with EU and UN to approve Taliban as pre-government of Afghanistan. Of course, Taliban cannot become the government of Afghanistan, and because EU and UN did not talk with them, they finally destroyed Bamyan Buddha which is precious human cultural asset. The EU and UN had to negotiate with them even though the Taliban was not recognized as the official government because they already ruled most of Afghanistan and the EU and UN needed to create a solution to protect the people of Afghanistan and the Bamyan Buddha. Secondly, the idea that EU contributed to the decline of war is wrong. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1990 to 2004, only 4 wars occurred between countries. Aside from country-to-country war, almost every other war was civil war. The decline of war is due to the flow of international politics, not because of the EU.  When I first heard that the EU have earned a nobel peace prize, I was really surprised. The reason is that the EU has played an important role during the war and also did good job to end it. However, now, the EU is having a lot of problems in economies, relationships, and so on. It is true that countries in the EU tried to unify and made some effort to do good politics. However when we think about whether EU has promoted ""Peace"" to the other countries, I can't help saying no to this question. The nobel peace prize should be given to the one who strived to promote peace all other the world. In this meaning, I don't think that the EU is appropriate for the prize to be given.  Since I had thought that Nobel Prize is to be given to individuals, so this news surprised me, but I think EU deserves that Prize. This is because It is true that there have been no war in Europe for over a half-century, and Nobel Peace Prize have been given to non-individuals several times.  I think the EU should not be awarded the Nobel Prize. EU scale is too large. EU does not bring economic development. Gap in Europe is larger. When the EU was able to redress the economic disparity, I admit their Nobel Prize.  Certainly the European Union is trying to change Europe and the world in a peaceful way, the way to understand this isn't only one, the news showed. EU hasn't achieved the real peace yet because each country doesn't turn them face toward the same direction.  I agree with the award because EU prevent a big war between countries in Europe. However, if one country has economic crisis, a lot of country will be influenced. This is a defect about Eu. As many people know, Greece has had economic crisis and country around Greece were damaged too.  We can imagine but we don't or will never know how the world without EU would go on and what would happen there. So I cannot know what eurosceptics say. They should recognize the value of the presence and contribution toward peace of EU.  I think Nobel peace prize in the wonderful award in the world. Also EU has a right to get this award because they control European countries peacefully. This is not easy thing to do. Still now, many wars are happening around the world and many people died because of wars which make no sense. From this news, I hope people should notice about how wonderful peace is and try to make world better than now.  It is pleasing that EU received Nobel  peace prize. However, EU has a lot of problems which have to be solved immediately. For example, it is financial crisis. Once it occur in any country in EU, it spread all over EU countries. We have to think of the both advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the Nobel Peace Prize must not be given as a joke. I believe that before giving the prize, many people think carefully and judge that it is suitable for EU. Certainly America and Japan keep the peace, but the case of EU, there are many countries. It is not just the matter between two countries. I think this prize is suitable for EU.  I strongly disagree with ID12017 from ""EU Nobel Peace Prize earns praise and ridicule"" I think it's wrong that EU had received Nobel prize because it's something natural try not to have a war between countries. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be given to individuals who did great effort to not only to prevent the war, but something more.  I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is true that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe. For example, Europe considers itself the cradle of human rights and democracy, has called for protection of human rights to other countries but if you wear a covering Burka called European Muslims will be fined penalties. Construction of a mosque with a minaret not allowed in countries such as Switzerland. Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored.  i think the reason of EU got the Nobel Peace prize is not appropriate.  He think it is okay that Nobel Peace Prize is given non-individuals several times. I think so too, but EU is not appropriate ""several times"". EU has many problems, so I can't overlook them.  This comment says this Nobel Peace Prize is Joke. Certainly, he could thought at first it is strange to award EU which has a seriously financial problem now. However, I believe this Nobel Prize has an important mean that they want EU to deal with the terrible situation, expecting the future. I wrote detailed it the box ""Lesson review"". This comment don't understand it. So, I strongly disagree with.  The word 'Peace' have to be thought as pluralistic. In other words, peace can be a real peace to some people, but not to other people. For example, one country could think that they had kept the peace by fighting against to other country. However, citizens, or countries which gave and received damage can think that it's not a peace but just a unhappiness.  I agree in EU awarding a prize of the Nobel Prize. This is because EU continued keeping European peace and prosperity for 60 years. I think that the new war does not happen in Europe, and the peace is keeping. Therefore this news is a very happy thing.  I also think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize, but individual should be respect, i think. so i strongly disagreed with this comment.  I agree with this opinion because Nobel Prize is for the people who distribute the peace of the world, not peace specific area indeed. As I commented before, it is difficult to treat EU distributed peaceful of Europe area. Europe area could stay peaceful in past decades because tendency of world politics going toward decrease of wars, not because effort of EU countries resulted. Also, same as written in this comment, there is a people who criticize EU Nobel Prize as EU point out as a reason why the economic crisis occurred recently accelerated.  As I wrote the comment in this article, I strongly believe that individuals have to be won the Nobel Prize not company or organization.  I can't agree with Europe receiving Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, 60 years without wars is very important thing. But there are many countries without wars more than 60 years. And regarding economic, Europe has crimes as much as wars. Europe leads world to bad situation. Europe must have responsible about that.  In addition to praise the recipient's activity, the aim of Nobel Prize is to promote the act of recipient . I think this Nobel Peace Prize is thought a little differently from other Nobel Prize. This Prize for EU means that many people wants EU to unite more strongly. EU was founded after reflection of two World War and Cold War. Although more tighter connection was expected, it is hard to say this dream has come true. EU has lots of problems to solute, for example, European economic crisis. Each country has different opinions and some participating nation doubt about EU itself. In this situation, this award is thought to be a message from the world that cheer EU up.  The prize praised, at the same time critics attacked it as a misplaced. I think that this critics reaction was right action. I can't agree with EU Nobel Peace Prize. After all, I didn't understand the meaning and the contents of this prize.  Originally, my opinion to this article is different from his, however, his opinion is so logical and after reading his comment, I became in favor of it.  I strongly disagree with this idea because EU hasn't promoted ""Peace"". This is the most important reason to be given a Nobel Peace Prize and EU hasn't done it. Don't have any reason to be deserved to given a prize I agree with the award of 2012 Nobel Peace Prize to the EU in recognition of 60 years without war. Surely, because of the recent world depression, many people and countries in Europe were suffered from financial problem. Especially, Spain and Greece are the most struggling countries in the world and still suffered from the problem. But, I think that the award gave the EU a new responsibility to create more united, more just and stronger peace. For that, the cooperation of the EU is more and more essential. I hope that the European Union keep unifying for peace forever.  I think that the EU deserves to win the Nobel Prize. It is very difficult to cooperate with other countries about economic, security, diplomacy and the judiciary and try to do that. Surely their aim has not achieved yet. But, I think that the attempt which you never have seen deserve the award.  I think what is related to politics such as EU and the prime minister should not be awarded. In Japan, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was awarded, but a secret understanding problem became appeared later. I don't think that any politician contribute the world peace without political intention. That's why I give a thought to what is concerned with politics should not be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Because she think about this news same as my opinion. And she suggested ""wide way of thinking"", I think this opinion is very wonderful, and I think that I want to be a person able to have the way of thinking like her.  I disagree with this comment because it focuses on a point alone. To be sure, Greece and EU influenced the world's economic for negative, however, this alone can't explain it's unsuitability for the prise. Those awarded the Nobel  Prizes  have had faults many or few. The same thing can be said to this case. Of course EU has effects that can't be praised , on the contrary, they surely contribute to peace for its members. We should see things inclusively.  I don't agree eurosceptics' opinions. The EU hasn't done anything yet, but I think the prize can put pressure on the EU's future efforts. To overcome today's aspect, the prize was necessary.  I think it is good for EU to receive the Nobel Prize. The Prize makes EU think that they should cooperate with each other stronger. This effect is good for the World Peace.  I disagree with this opinion. I think EU isn't entitled to Nobel Peace Prize and there are no wars in Japan, too. I think there are many people who are more entitled this prize in the world.  This news is very nice. But, I can't understand EU contributes to world peace. Certainly, it is very important there has been no wars in EU for 60 years. Nowadays, there are very few wars of between countries in the world.  Everyone probably thought the same thing but I also think that the EU are worthy of the nobel prize as theres nothing special to it. They should not be any war in the first place.  In my opinion, EU Nobel Peace Prize is valuable to prosper countries and enhance connection between EU nations. Reward is happy to everyone. I hope cloth countries cooperate with each other and raise more able for award. "
JOC JOC-12B-06N -0.0100000000000005 "I think Obama's re-election is meaningful for both US and Japan. First, for America, I believe that he is responsible for restoring finances because US has to face tax increase by expiration of big reduction of taxes and cutback of revenue early in the new year if any new policy don't carried out. It means American economy falls into serious depression and it influences for many countries all over the world. Next, he have showed friendship to Japan. Japanese government should take advantage of it to solve the territorial dispute with China and South Korea.  I guessed Obama would be elected again, and actually it came to realized. It was allegedly said that Obama's triumph was monumental achievement because none had won re-election under high employment rate of above 8% since 1940. But given that there is increasingly population of Latinos who endorse Democrat, it isn't so surprising things. According to this article, 71% of Latinos voted Obama and 50000 Latinos turn 18 and are entitled to vote every month. The figure of 71% indicates that the large number of Latinos advocated him. His social welfare program 'Obama Care' probably attracted them, many of who are in low or middle income group. Also, his tolerant attitude toward illegal immigrants would be benefit for them, many of who are too immigrants or descendants of them. So, it might be natural that Obama won the re-election under such circumstances. Besides, the figures also indicate that Latinos is getting no longer minority in US and Obama is popular among them. The population of Latino voters is on the great increase and it follows that Obama may get more support of Latinos if he can keep his words. His victory might be good for US, but it would be bad for Japan. Usually, Democrats harshly require Japan to share the more costs of the US military base in Japan. Also, US-Japan relationship became weak during his first term. I hope he will put emphasis on the relationship and make every effort to strengthen it. .  The presidential election in America is one of the most important events. 4 years later, Mr. Obama won this election very easily, but this time, the election became harder than last time. During the campaign of election, the huge hurricane came to NY and the candidates stopped continuing campaign. I think Mr. Obama's correspondence of hurricane led winning of election. However, during 4 years which Mr. Obama was inaugurated as President, he didn't do good policies. I hope Mr. Obama will govern the huge country and the world rather than before.  After hard competition, Mr. Obama eventually won the presidential election again. America gives various effects to Japan. Japan needs America's cooperation in some problems of Asia. So this election is important for Japan, too. What he will do in second term can influence on all over the world. I hope he won't break the goals of his second term which he set out, or he might be not able to won the next election.  I was glad to hear this news. Mr. Obama is supporting TPP, of course, it has the risk to press Japanese agriculture and so on. But it is the most important to fight on the favorite field for Japan, and firstly, we should revive Japanese economy earlier than protect agriculture. I believe his victory will become Japanese victory. . .  I welcome Obama's reelection. I was surprised at the fact that Obama is only fourth Democrat to reelect. The American political climate is, I think, considerably different from Japanese. In short, they have much higher interest in politics than Japanese have. That offers the number of $932,013,388, which is the money supporters spent on Obama's campaign, or of $1, 028, 213, 064, which is on Romney's. Public notice of the Election of the House of Representatives in Japan will be provided soon. I will see how exciting it will be, and who will win it.  l think Obama's re-election is good news for USA. Mr. Obama has power of improving economy of USA and many problems. I expect him.  I think it is hard four years for Barack Obama. Obama won and made the boom of ""Yes, we can. "" in the previous election. But, he does not have such power now. I think this is good news for Japan. I think Obama does not disregard Japan. But, there is a problem in Japan because Japanese prime minister often change. So, if Obama make a point of relation between Japan and US , Japanese government will not arrange a reception. I think this is good news for US too. I heard that Obama's measures against hurricane Sandy was good. I think it is important because measures against hurricane is a matter of life and death. So, I think this is good news for Japan and US .  For the time being I will praise Obama's re-election. Romney. had made many gaffes. Even if he had great results, he should be more careful for his remark. Prime minister has great influence on the people even when he says one word. Prime minister also has great responsibility for the people. In that point, Obama is better than Romney.. And also I think that we should evaluate his challenge of gay marriage and the policy of immigrant in the election term. Conceding gay marriage was different in the US this is because Christian doesn't admit gay marriage in terms of religion. But Obama decide to give gays the right to marry. It is meaningful for gays that are discriminated. This will be one step that does away with the discrimination. Furthermore, I think that the new policy of immigrate has the meaning. Fundamentally, the US has many races. It is said ""melting pot of races"". Nowadays, the number of Hispanic people is increasing rapidly. Most of them are illegal immigrants. Even though they are illegal immigrants in current system, Obama decide to accept immigrants under some conditions. He could show the tolerance of immigrant to the world. However, there are some doubts for Obama. For example, Obama didn't produce good result in four years. At present, US economy was bad. We cannot see the sign of getting over the recession. Can he really change the situation? Secondly, Obama won the election for the number of electoral colleges. But he lost the number of votes. In other words, he was not supported by ordinary people. It is problematic. Direct election of Prime Minister didn't work out. Under the circumstance, the opinion of the people may be reflected to the policy or bill. For these reasons, Obama must make effort to be trusted by the people.  i think mr. Obama's re-election is meaningful to Japanese economy and the problems with North Korea and China. president Obama wants Japan to join TPP and i know this will let down Japanese agriculture but i believes that it will makes Japanese industries better. also mr. Obama thinks that world needs to be safe and peace so he might do something when north and China became crazy.  I was surprised four years ago, when Obama become first Black president in United States. Now, I was surprised once again. Through his four year career as president, there were many incident happen in United States. That include confront between Iraq. I think especially withdraw US military from Iraq and execute Osama Bin Laden works great for Obama's re-election. Also, he mention that he support gay marriage. It must be such a great news for people who are gay/lesbian who were discriminated. I think that earns his votes too. I hope Obama will do more great work in his second term of his presidency.  I am quite happy for Barack Obama and the citizens of the United States as his odyssey continues to its full measure. I was first surprised when he acquired the position of the US president because I did not imagine American people would accept a 'black' as their leader(I do not mean to discriminate). However, all his work he has done throughout 4 years, I personally like him as I can see the real honesty in him and his statements. I also respect him as a great speaker compared to other presidents from all over the world.  I like Barack Obama and know how much effort he made for the citizens because I have lived in the United States and learned many measures he tried. Unfortunately, the rate of unemployment has not changed a little, but I think he deserves to be the most respectable president in the world. Also, it is important for Japan. We are in dangerous situation about the islands among China, and Korea. Maybe he cares about Japan and saves us.  One of the policies of Barack Obama about tax resulted in his re-election, I think. In US, the gap between the rich and the poor is quite big, and it would have become much harder for so-called low income earners to live if a policy that advocate raising tax had been adopted. Obama promised not to do that instead he would raise tax only for wealthy people. The policy gathered voter support. I hope the policy promotes wealth redistribution and work well.  I think that this reelection is good for the United States. Obama will lead the United States with strong leadership. However, for Japan, it is not necessarily good. Pains will be taken over a foreign policy from now on.  I'm really worried about Obama becoming a president again. Especially the relation between Japan. Generally, the Democratic Party is not pro-Japanese. I think it will be difficult for Japan to desire the growth of economy, diplomacy and so on.  I'm very impressed that Obama won re-election; no one had done it since 1940. Furthermore, he got more than 50% votes. However, I realize Obama is not gaining a backing from Whites while Blacks support him as 93% elect rate. Now, in America, people who want medical care have to spend expensive cost or have to be insured. (besides, insuring programs isn't cheap at all to the middle, the lower classes. )However, Obama is planning to promote the public good by magnifying medical insurance more friendly to welfare. I expect his active part until he ends his duty.  According to this article, Obama's re-election is evaluated in that he is only the fourth Democrat since 1900 to win two full terms in the White House. In this regard, I think, now we should observe it from another point. That is present leaders need much more time than ever to accomplish his policy enough. For now, in the far more fluid and complex world, only by short-term strategies, leaders can't make a difference. They have to do well with so many countries and deal with highly developed economy in order to be supported by people in his country. To do so, they inevitably need a long period of time. So I think that even if Obama couldn't do well in the last 4 years, another 4 years will help him bring something good for both US and the world.  From point of view of Pro Japanese, I think it didn't matter which candidate was elected. Both candidates put stress on diplomacy toward China. The Japanese key is whether Japan can make a good use of this or not.  l welcome Obama's re-election. It must be a good for America's future. His policy hit the heart of not only the poor but relatively rich people. For Japan, we don't lack him. His power of improving economy is respectful, I think.  I don't understand Obama's policy. Honestly, I don't know that it affect to me, but I seem to affect to Japan. Japan get along with America in the future. Firstly, Japan should do it to settle the problem between Japan and China.  I think Obama is one of the greatest president in the postwar period. He can manage this global situation. In Japan, new prime minister Abe was selected. I feel ease because Abe is the person who should be leader of Japan. He have defined vision of national defense. Japan has serious territory with China and South Korea. Japan must go in with US But the democratic party is unwilling to manage this problem. I expect his ability.  Actually, I can not say which is better. However, Mr. Obama rendered some services to military affairs. I think that he has an ability to manage his country. And, at the presidential election, he promised that the government makes employment opportunities at the manufacturing industry. To be concrete, a million people will get the jobs. I expect that he fulfill a campaign promise immediately.  I think that Obama is suitable for US President. He stressed importance of resolving the challenges that the world have, such as violent extremism, insurgency and spread of nuclear weapons. Whereas, Romney emphasized ""Peace through Strength"". I think Romney was too idealistic. US can't lead the world without solving the current problems. Though it is uncertain whether Obama succeeds or not, I believe he is a good president.  Barack Obama, the 44th and current President of the United States was re-elected in November 2012. Due to the conservative political environment of America which has harassed a lot of ordinary and ill-informed people who make up most of the population, President Obama won the election in 2008. Keeping the social atmosphere which helped him to win the election by a landslide in mind, he had to continue progress towards leading America towards a more prosperous and harmonious future. This more moderate view which aimed towards the betterment of the American society greatly contributed towards his victory. As a politician in a democratic country where the politicians work for the good of the people, he had to embody this message that allowed him to win the election. Also, in regards to the international aspect of the United States of America, he had to consider what policies and practices of America could impact other countries. Furthermore, upon making these policies he had to carefully put them into practice so as to not disturb the international community. In the 4 years of his first term, he made a better welfare state while simultaneously enacting better policies for the international society. For example, on the domestic front, Federal welfare spending has grown by 32 percent over the past four years, accelerated by President Obama's stimulus spending and has also swelled by a growing number of Americans whose recession-depleted income has now qualified them for public assistance. Also, he ended US military involvement in the Iraq War. These kinds of actions can be praised by the public. But if we think about the message that he promoted during his campaign, we will notice that he has diverged a little from it. For example, He has worsened the war between Palestine and Israel with some careless policies, which have been characteristically repeated throughout the history of American diplomacy. He said ""There's no country on Earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders, "" and when he made this perfectly sensible statement he was not thinking of the Palestinians in Gaza, helpless victims of Israeli bombs and missiles or in some cases bombs and missiles that were dropped or fired from F-16 fighters or Apache helicopters manufactured in the US. He never changed his political attitude or policies towards the Palestinian civilization, despite being criticized by the international community. This does not seem like the practice of the American President who won the election under the banner of peace and betterment of society. For the next 5 years, civil society, which is concerned about the prospects of the future, should urge him to choose better policies in order to create and maintain a peaceful and just world society.  I think Mr. Obama's re-election is good and important for not only USA but also Japan and many countries. I expect him for economical and political problems.  I think Obama's re-election have good influence especially Japan. Actually, When Obama erected as American president last time, I was surprised. And this time, too. I would like Obama be erected, but Romney had strong power especially on white, so I was glad to hear this news Obama's re-election. The reason is that Obama feel more and more friendship with Japan, so I think it is meaningful for us. Japan would be able to make a solid background on the relationship in Asia. Japan which don't have army needs American power, I think.  I thought there was an unexpectedly large margin in the results of the vote. Obama probably won back his popularity by dealing with the approaching storm appropriately. The treatment reminds me of the great earthquake in East Japan, which Mr. Kan, the Prime Minister at the time couldn't cope with. And also Obama's attitude toward diplomacy might be supported by many people. I guess his mind was occupied with leaving achievements for the re-election. I want him to concentrate his energy on leaving achievements that remain in history.  I think that the presidential election was a tough situation, Obama's approval rating is lowered. However, he was able to win the election because responded to severe hurricane damage immediately. I think it is an indication that expects to enhance the social welfare of the people to America's first black president in the unequal society progresses.  Congratulations! I'm glad to hear the news. America is the country that connects closely with Japan. It will be easier to conduct foreign relations if the same person becomes the president. I wish Japan could be the same.  I'm happy to Obama was reelected US president. I support Obama. I believe this thing give Japan good effect. Sometimes, He is criticized for the mass media. They said Obama's policy aren't practical. But, I want to hold out him. I feel Obama is concerned about American people's happiness seriously.  I was shocked for reading this article. I can realize the greatness of Obama. I think his policy is so novelty. His policy brings much happiness for many people. I believe it.  This re-election may reflects the hope of American people to him. They dissatisfied with his economic measures now, so I expect him to change that in the future.  Obama's re-election is the good news. I think being elected again shows peoples' confidence or expectations. And I hope this re-election bring some good changes to Japan.  I don't know that it is good news for Japan. America must decrease amount of money to military. The nation's finances are bankrupt because of the war.  Obama probably won back his popularity by dealing with the approaching storm appropriately. This opinion is good. And Obama's attitude toward diplomacy is appropriate.  This news is good for the world because he mention about economy especially reducing unemployment. It will be good for our economy. He couldn't do that this 4 Years but I believe he can du it. I want Japanese government to cooperate the U. S. and make a good relationship for Japan.  When Obama was elected as American president 4 years ago, American people was so delighted and hoped that he would change the country. And, certainly, Obama solved some problem in and out of America. However, the situation is different from first election. The situation will be more difficult than then. It is worth seeing how Obama will change the world again.  I'm interested in politics but I don't know much about it. I just hope Japan and U. S will cooperate each other more and contribute to peace of the world.  I'm glad and expect Mr. Obama's re-election. Against Japan, many Japanese are glad of his re-election I think. But in America, we know other candidate get popularity, I don't know what his election brings to America, but it's meaning America don't think Japan is important? I'm sad to know that.  I was glad to hear the news. I don't have so much knowledge about American politic or economy but he is the first black president of America so I think the late Mr. King would be glad too. I hope Obama's going well and leading the world to peace and welfare.  Frankly speaking, I do not have Mr Obama's good impression. Because Japan is having the TPP problem which Obama brought about. I disagree with TPP participation. It is true that TPP participation will make Japan cause the competitions among Japanese companies and get cheap goods but it may make Japanese people of agricultural and medical fields ruin. Obama is clinging obstinately to Japanese TPP participation negotiation. When he was fighting in USA president election, I was deeply impressed by his having insisted TPP problems in order to collect more votes.  this election is big news for all over the world. i hope Mr, Obama do good job and also Japan and America have a better international relations.  I like Obama's way of speaking and was happy to hear this news. He speaks very powerfully and I have many things to learn from him. I don't know well about America's politics but since America is the strongest country in the world, he makes a good affect around the world.  I am happy to hear this news because, I think Obama is better than Romney.  I thought that Obama would re-elect again and he became 44th president in America. Japan and America have same category problem; it's an economy crisis. He will do his best to solve this huge problem. This is one of the main reasons that our politics have been confused and unsuccessful. I believe politics depend on economy, economy also depends on politics, so they are inseparable. We, for example, were on the rapid economic growth in the post-WW II period and we did not have huge politic problem with LDP at that time. There are new leaders in Japan and America. I wish Obama and Abe would improve both countries economy.  It is good news for Japan. Mr. Obama treat Japan in friendly. Japan has problem about military base in Futenma. During Obama's government continues, Japan should solve it.  I think that both Obama and Romney had done their best, but as the article says, Obama had succeeded in gaining votes from black, latinos, young ages and so on. But still, it is also true that the president have many difficulties that he has to confront with. As the article says, action on the deficit will require a ""grand bargain"" with Congress and that means the Republican party, which retained control of the House of Representatives, though Democrats remain in charge in the Senate. The risk for Obama is that, for all his renewed talk of bipartisan co-operation, he might be thwarted by all too familiar gridlock. Anyway, we Japanese also have to keep an eye on how the US will sail their ship because its decision of the route will affect our country and the stream of the world.  I was really glad that President Obama was reelected in election. The Japanese Prime Ministers are changed in sequence, but may not determine it. Therefore I wants President Obama to govern it during a long period without being changed in sequence. I pray to the election four years later for President Obama being reelected.  Japan does not have good China and Korea and relations now. However, this is because I think that he protects Japan from China and Korea by all means because Obama took office as the President in the United States. In other words the influence that is good for Japan is brought because Obama takes office as the President.  This person worries about Obama taking office as the President very much. In addition she worries about relations with Japan, but I think that it does not need worry at all. Therefore I am against the opinion of this person.  I think that the re-election is meaningful for Japan and America. As everyone knows, he has a great power, so I think would make the economies of America as well as Japan better.  I wanted Mr. Obama to win the election, so I felt relieved to hear Obama's win. It may be so difficult to achieve goal he has displayed, but to displaying goal itself is meaningful. Above all for changing something, it needs many times. He might not be able to meet views of citizens perfectly, but I think, American citizens have to leave him more time. It can say to Japanese politics. In Japan there are so many elections and so many changing our tops. This is one of the reasons that though there are so many problems left, politician couldn't the solutions. We have to study from another countries elections and politics.  I don't agree with this comment because I think whether this result become good for Japan or bad is depend on us. In fact Mr. Obama shows us the attitude that makes good relationships between Japan. Most important thing is how Japanese government do, and most important problem is they couldn't have clear strategy.  I thought that Obama should have been elected, and now I think it is better to come it true. Mainly, their support base. That of Obama is, poor people and minorities including non-white people, gays and so on. On the other hand, that of Romney. is wealthy people and, so to speak, majorities. I think if Romney. would be elected, discrimination of races and minorities and distinctions between the wealthy and the poor would increase, not only in US but also globally, needless to say in Japan. We should pay attention to the result of a narrow margin, but a primary factor that made Obama win is authorizing equal marriage for gay couples, I think.  I think Obama's re-election is very meaningful not only for America but also for world. In my opinion, Obama seems to be the man having a strong sense of responsibility. And it is also meaningful that a black person was re-elected the president of America which leads world as a leader. In the world, there are still remain racial discriminations. So this election was very important.  I think this reaction is good for the United States. I am always touched by his strongest speech. Honestly, I don't know about American politics very much. , but only I'm interested in problem of American military base at Okinawa. Before, Japanese woman is raped by American soldier. I want this kind of happening never to occur. I hope trust relation of American and Japan is more good than before.  Mr. Obama's reelection is good for USA and also for Japan. Especially in economical fields. The yen will keep itself strong and and because of that Japan can buy foreign stuffs cheaper. For instance, it makes possible for us to buy expensive things, such as gasolines cheaper.  I do not know that Obama's election is good for the USA and Japan But, I have a reason why the Obama's election is very good for the USA. It is that First Lady Michelle Obama is tackling issue of childhood obesity. I heard that the nearly one in three children in the USA is considered overweight now. It is very serious issue. American government will have to spend more and more budget in the health care system. The government has to solve it as early as possible. Then, Mrs. Obama is tackling it. Concretely, she trying to bring health food to underprivileged communities and change menus in school. I think that food make us very happy. So, I feel it very sad that food caused many people death. Therefore, I support her campaign and think that Obama's election is good for the USA.  I strongly agreed with her comment because I also expected that Obama came back as the President of US at election. Also he brings a good influence to both America and Japan. He was the president when world economy became worse and worse. He knew what happened in the world now, and he is impatient for reviving US economy like before. He has good relationship among other countries. This will help Japan to solve territorial problems between Korean and China.  It makes no difference who the American president is. USA focuses on China, and no longer treats Japan as an important country. But I think Obama is better than Romney, so I felt relief at the news that Obama's reelection.  At first, I wondered whether Obama could win the election. this is because he was criticized by some American. They said ""He couldn't accomplish the policy that he made in the last election"". In this time of recession, it is hard for people to wait the long-term policy to come true. But now he won the election, it is turned out to be true that American expect his long-term projects. I'm interested in problem of the gun control. Can he reinforce the law?There are lots of opponents, for example, National Rifle Association.  This news is very nice for Japan and USA. I respect Obama's skill of making speech and he is excellent president. He will lead USA bright future.  Having Obama as president is positive for both Japan and America. I thought this as everyone trusts him and is willing him to continue with his work towards world peace.  Yeah, I guess it is a good thing for there are lots of poor people in America and he is saying that he's gonna help them. But the important thing is that he need to deal with the fiscal cliff first of all.  Obama did a great effort and got the win on this election. What I noticed at this election was, changing of supporters. Obama collected votes from 93% of African American, 71% of Latinos, and 55% of women. Today, the US is not only for white men. Other races, young ages and also women organize this society. So, the leader of this country is also needed to change for people. I hope Obama would rustle more in his second term.  I want Obama to make the society more liberal too.  the reason why Japan is on bad terms with US depends on Japan. Japan's fuzzy reaction makes US irritated.  He was re-elected , but the situation is different from that of first time he was elected. When he elected to president for the first time, people in USA have a lot of expectation to him, but this time, he was elected because his opponent laid too emphasis on rich people.  I think having Obama as a president of America is good for America and Japan. And I think the way he talks has a lot of power to make people understand and convincing. Every time there is a election in US I always think it is interesting how American citizens become very active because it is very different from Japan. I was surprised when I when to america right before election, there were lots of things that has Romney. and Obamas print on them on sale every where. I think this difference of interests comes from the election system in America.  After I read this article, I'm happy that he was elected. Of course I can't agree with all of his ideas, but I want him to hang on! When I heard his re-election, I'm very good feelings. It is true that his deeds are not always good. However I think he is one of the best presidents. "
JOC JOC-13B-09O 0.69 "I think washoku is wonderful culture and asset which Japan should be proud of. Now, Japanese officials are negotiating with other countries over TPP. I think Japan is not good at diplomatic negotiation. However, we have the great cultural heritage ""washoku"". In washoku, it is important to make use of materials and the climate of Japan and crops, livestock products and marine products which are raised in Japan. We have to show off the value of washoku and the importance of that crops, livestock products and marine products of Japan own are protected. Then, TPP negotiation and the economy may take a turn for the better by a brand power of washoku.  It's valuable and honorable that washoku was registered as the UNESCO heritage in 2013. I'm proud of many people eating washoku all over the world. Wherever we travel to, we can enjoy eating washoku. However, some of them are far from traditional Japanese cuisine. I think it is important to teach genuine washoku to foreign countries.  I'm a Japanese people, but I don't like Japan's traditional cuisine, known as ""washoku"", actually. I felt that it is wasteful not to understand merit of it. So I want to tell many charms of it to various people. In addition, I think it is good chance for Japan. Although western food is delicious, Japanese cuisine has other merit. We should protect it.  I was filled with pride on hearing of this news. Washoku's designation as an Intangible Cultural Asset is likely to have only positive impacts on Japanese people, society and economy. I think the fact that washoku has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list means we all Japanese pledged worldwide to inherit washoku. However, as the article says, it is true that washoku has been declining. It is Japanese that are responsible for succession of washoku. So, I want to contribute to that by learning the way to cook from my mother, not depending on fast food.  Probably, many Japanese people is proud of own culture. Needless to say, me too. But, I think Japanese culture is no longer seated Japanese living because of importation European culture. This news have potential to retrieve position what Japanese culture was.  I think Japanese people have to eat washoku more. If we don't eat them, we lose one of our tradition. So, I eat rice and miso soup every day.  I used to hesitate eating raw fish food, but when I took part in an international party, people from other countries strongly recommended me to try. From that time, I came to like Japanese cuisine. I'm so happy that Washoku is attractive to people all over the world and the fact UNESCO accepted it. I hope this will trigger to people who have a prejudice like me.  I think we can keep our health by eating Washoku. So, when I cook something, I always care about nutritional balance for my body. I consider that it lets to long life.  Now , people like to eat fast food. But fast food is not good to our health. Therefore , there are many people who are obesity. However , in contrast to fast food , ""washoku"" have merits of our body. So, I'm glad when I read this news. I hope that this matter lead good things.  I was happy to hear the news. I think Japanese food which is called ""washoku"" is the world's greatest cuisine. It is healthy and delicious. Although fast food is also tasty, it is bad for our health. When we eat fast food every day, it may lead to disease. We had better eat washoku every day for our body. I hope more and more people around the world to know about washoku and try to eat it.  I was glad to hear the news that ""washoku"" known as Japan's traditional cuisine had been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. I strongly think that Japanese love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" has a lot of seasonal foods. For example, ""JT002"" is a spring food, ""somen"" is a summer food, ""kurigohan"", in English ""marron rice"", is an autumn food and ""oden"" is a winter food. Therefore, we can feel four seasons a year, Japanese people are never tired of foods we eat. In conclusion, Japanese people love ""washoku"" because ""washoku"" makes us notice four seasons.  In this year, we heard only happy news about UNESCO heritage status. Although, we has a problem with Korean. I hope the excitement cools down and UNESCO heritage status won't never sow the seeds of discord.  I am very happy to hear the news. I like Japanese cuisines and I want foreign countries people to know how good it is. Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy. I think it is rare characteristic of our foods I know many countries are interested in the Japanese food, but I did not expect ""washoku"" to gets UNESCO heritage status. Fast food is popular among young people. However, young people should care about their health. I hope that ""washoku"" are known as a healthy cuisine by this news in the world.  This summer, I went to the United Kingdom to study English. I was very surprised to find many Japanese food restaurants. In the United Kingdom, Japanese food is very famous and popular, especially for young women, because it is low in calories, good for health and delicious. However, Japanese food which was sold in the United Kingdom was far from ""true Japanese food "". It was difficult for me to explain what it was. It seemed like Japanese and Korean food. I think this situation happens all over the world. Of Course, I know there are some restaurants where sell ""true Japanese food"" in the world. I want many foreign people to know ""true Japanese food"" and know its wonderfulness, so I was happy to hear this news.  I agree with your opinion that Japanese foods have seasonal changing we can enjoy and it is rare characteristic of our foods. Many countries don't have seasonal changing, so we should proud of the fact. Japanese food reflect the advantage, so I also want many foreign people to know its wonderfulness. "
JOC JOC-14B-17N 0.67 "I don't know many awkward handshakes did between many countries. I think what xi's face wasn't smile though Abe was smiling at first means xi feared Chinese people's reaction if he was doing congress with smile. He had no choice in order to save Chinese people's support for him. I think it is good to meet them . Abe wants to improve relations with Beijing , so his face was smile as he meet xi. Although xi's expression was not good, to be able to hold the congress means xi will think that making better relation with Japan. I think xi's face means two things. One is taking hostile action against Japan for save people's support for him. Another is an expression that he doesn't know what he should do between anti Japanese and thinking of improvement of relation to Japan .  The uncomfortable handshakes by world leaders cannot be helped though they are formally. However, frequent handshakes shouldn't be done because the act may cause bad feelings among the people who have dissatisfaction about policy. And it may become a serious situation. So they need consider whether the negotiation went smoothly when handshaking.  Awkward handshakes have a deep meaning and an important background. Through world history there were many conflicts between countries. In order that these problems were solved, each top leader discussed, but they never permitted each other I think. They paid attention to the whole world and they laughed shaking hands. I hope the day will come when I can see them shaking hands and laughing together from the bottom of their hearts.  The uncomfortable handshakes can't be helped. Conflicting interpretation of history can be solved easily. This time, Held Japan-China summit have plenty of meaning for two countries. Until that point China criticized Japan within the country, finally the summit substantialized. On China's part, he, they can't choose but tout for Chinese subject that Abe administration changed toward the bright side for consistency's sake of their assertion. That will be likely to make them weaken criticism toward Japanese government. It could be nearing reality to shake hands comfortably with smile.  Awkward handshakes is often done between leaders of not only nation but also corporation. These actions are necessary. Many people usually say flattery. Being honest is not always good. However, we want to avoid them as much as possible.  Handshake, whether it is awkward or not, may the useful way to establish friendly relationship. I once heard that in terms of psychology, man who cater to shake hand has a expectation to the person he is speaking to. In this case, that is president Abe and Xi's shaking hand, this theory doesn't hold good. But in someday, I hope the two countries truly help each others and handshake as a sign of trust.  Handshake is indispensable for establishing friendly relationship. Handshake show good relationship between two people or organization. It is good culture and carries out important tasks in the place that people make good relationship in. This culture will continue to the future.  I think so, too. With conflicts two groups or countries cannot go ahead and make better future. Shaking hands means that people of both sides want to mend the relation. After shaking hands, they can proceed to the future. But two leaders just pretend to be friendly, like Neville Chamberlain and Hitler, there is no future. In fact they cannot have stopped WW2. People should seek peace and friendship with other countries and groups so that leaders can shake hands without any secret intentions.  I would like to mention ""The uncomfortable handshake between Japan's Shinzo Abe and China's Xi Jinping"" in this article. I am very interested in the relationships between Japan and China. I take a Japan-China relations class. Teacher took up this problem. This meeting got a big write-up in the newspapers. Neighboring countries often disagree with each other. However, we have to search for the ways to make friends with China.  I agree with you. Handshake is great culture and can be a bridge of friendship between enemies. We have to do our best in order to deepen friendly relations. Handshake is often a courtesy and counterfeit. However, shake hand symbolizes our efforts to make friends with other countries and someone. It is very important action.  Handshake is a form to establish friendly relationship. If handshakes between countries are awkward, this action is very important each other. Now, the relation between Japan and China is bad, however, Japanese prime minister Abe and China's president Xi shook hands the other day. I think this action will be a key to improve the nation relationship in such two countries.  Awkward handshake between national counterparts seems to be the diplomatic fault, but I think this awkwardness has a great meaning. For example, Japan and China are the very influenced nations, so many nations that have deep relationship with Japan and China pay attention to the meeting between Shinzo Abe and Xi Jinping. Given the assumption, the two power have to take such nations into consideration. Moreover, Japan and China have a lot of diplomatic problem between them. So, in order to represent the nation's decision that we don't want to yield to counterpart, the awkward handshake is needed.  Before I read this article, I didn't know there are such a lot of awkward handshake in the world. In this article I only know about Japan and China's relationship isn't so good. The background of Japan and China's awkward relationship is that Japan colonized China in past. And other awkward relationships' background are related to things happened in past. It is sure that people in those country turn against. Also it is impractical that all countries are going to make peaceful relationship. However, I think we should try to make good relation.  I hope so too. Japan and China are leader of Asia, so if they help each other, not only Asia but also all over the world would develop.  why we are not able to be good relations. I could have not understand such awkward handshake. so I was surprised to read this article. Certainly there is awkward handshake between us. But we are not able to stop such handshake. All we can do is only to see it. Such culture like this will continue.  In Japan , there is very interesting word ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" It means ""eye talks a lot of thing just as we talk."" In this case, we can say ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" I think we can communicate many things by body language than by talking.  When we want to show friendship, we naturally try to handshake. It is because it is the easiest way. However, we sometimes do it absentmindedly. I think it is not good. I think we should let handshake have meaning.  I was shocked at this story because various countries have awkward relationships between other countries. I want everyone to handshake with smile from their heart.  I agree with your opinion. Thought, Japan has got along badly with China, there is a strong relationship between them. And, this awkward handshake reflects each countries diplomatic policy. I have not thought about formal handshake seriously, so I was surprised at this article. I learned that Every handshake has every deep meaning.  I have a doubt that it is thinking too seriously. Of course , their relationship influence various things. But uncomfortable handshakes is so formal. I think uncomfortable handshakes are necessary.  Thank you for your agreement. As for me, sometimes I also do such an awkward handshake in the case that I have to get along with someone I hate in my heart. In order not to get worse the relationship than now, we have to suppress our hatred. These awkward handshakes in the article shows what nations thought and what they want to express from their attitudes. I think this is the one of the fun of diplomacy. "
JOC JOC-14B-28N 2.32 "When I found the headline of this news, I thought it was very interesting for us because all of us are related to ""eating"" and ""health"". Recently, I often drink coffee and perhaps many people are more likely to drink coffee. For example, famous coffee shops such us STARBUCKS, there are always many people and maybe we tend to consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. However, this article reminds us how healthy drinking tea is. I live in Shizuoka, where tea is famous for, so i think I will more cups of tea than now and we should keep our health!! I was so surprised by the suggestion that tea is better for our health than water. I thought that the water is the best drink because it contains nothing extra. Through this news, I knew that tea's ingredients are good to our health so we should drink tea. However, we should remember that drinking tea too much makes us worth in terms of the health. We should only three cups of tea a day.  I was really surprised at this statement ""Drinking tea is actually better for you than drinking water. Water is essentially replacing fluid. Tea replaces fluids and contains antioxidants so it's got two things going for it. "" Being healthy is so important for us all human beings of course. I've loved to drink tea for long time, so I'll try to drink more.  When I read the head line, I was interested in it. I drink water every day, but I drink little cup of tea. So that is disturbing news for me. My family tend to get cancer, so it is good news for me that Tea has the effect of against cancer. Although I think I drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking.  This news is good news for me absorbed in a diet. It's surprise for something to excel to have matched water. But is the excessive drinking of excessive genki drink really good for a body? A question is left.  I was surprised to know that tea is not dehydrating and it is a healthy drink. I do not think that tea is bad for our health. However, our ancestors drink water because there is not tea long , long time ago. So, I believe that something we have eaten and drunken for long time is healthier than something we created. I was shocked to know the fact that tea is healthier than water is. We often misunderstand a fact because we believe ""common sense"". We have to remember this lessons and bear in mind.  I think that this article is very important for us. Because the health is one of the things which is the most important in our life. What I was surprised at in particular is that tea is better for health than water. Since I like tea, I always drink it. However, I feel that I drink tea too much. According to this article, the excessive drinking of the tea seems to be bad in health. So, I think that I want to be careful not to drink tea too much from now on.  I know that the correspondence to an emigrant is very severe situation in Japan. However, when I read this article, I felt that the situation was too terrible. All the human beings have human rights inherently. Not to mention it, it is not a thing applied to only a Japanese. As you can see, I think that it is not a permissible thing not to give a foreigner medical care. Japan should think about the acceptance of immigrants and asylum-seekers .  I like a tea more than a water. So, when I read this article, I was very happy. I want to spend healthy life because sicking life is bad for us. If drinking tea is more healthy than drinking water, I drink tea only! I'll try it.  This article is information useful for the girl who worries about health and a diet. It's said that they have the various effect on tea. For example, it was revealed that a catechin has the action against which the flu virus infection is defended. And, Recently, ""Tea-tox"" which makes waste discharge to the interior of the body is popular in Europe and America. I'll try to drink more! This is good news for me. This is because I drink much barley tea in a day. However, this article says only ""tea"", so I cannot know weather barley tea is useful or not. If the tea is pointed black tea, I examine to change my drink from barley tea to tea.  I am glad to read this news because I drink 2 or 3 cups of tea in a day. Actually, for most of the Japanese, drinking tea is one of the most common custom of everyday lives. I personally think we the Japanese should cherish the old tradition such as drinking tea.  I have heard that tea is good for human health. The fact that tea protects your teeth is very surprising. I am from Shizuoka, where is famous for tea. However, I rarely drink tea. After reading this article, I will try to drink tea everyday.  When I read this article, I was really surprised that drinking tea is good for our health, especially cancers, heart diseases, and teeth. I drink a cup of tea everyday and I think it is more delicious than water or some soft drink, so I was happy to hear that. I decide that I would not change my routine which drinks it every morning.  Drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese. We drink tea in daily life without thinking. Moreover. it's good news for us that Tea is good for health. However, I don't think we have to make it a habit. I think drinking tea is our traditional habit and we know how to enjoy it. I don't think it is good to take a cup of tea from a feeling of duty. Although it is important to keep our health, we should enjoy our culture.  I was surprised that tea is such a healthy drink. Recently, I think there is a trend STARBUCKS is cool and many people are more likely to drink coffee. May be i'm one of them. So, i think the consumption of tea decrease. But this is good news!! We are the people in country of Ryokucha. Let's try to drink more tea! I really agree with your idea that to be excessive is not good in everything. After having read this article, I also made a decision to drink more cups of tea, but at the same time, I would try to follow your advice!!! Anyway, I think it is a good thing for us to do what we can do for improving our health!! You said that you drink tea only. However, Everything in moderation. I think that drinking too much tea is bad for your health as might be expected. Health means a lot of different things to different people. If you are health-obsessed, the attitude towards your health has an adverse health effect in a nice little twist.  i was very surprised to see the news because I love tea and I always drink it. I've ever heard that drinking coffee is good for our health before, so it is in the nature of things that tea is healthy because it contains caffeine. But tea is useless when we have heatstroke, we can't recover without water. In that kind of meaning, I think water is healthier than tea.  I think so too. I've never known that tea has a good influence for health though I have known that drinking coffee is good for our health . I also love tea, so I like tea more than ever by reading the article.  I am very interested in your opinion. I like Starbucks, too, and also consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. In addition, when I watched the person who walks while drinking coffee of Starbucks in a town, they looks very smart. I understand that tea is healthier than coffee. However, I think I continue to drink coffee. But, I also want to drink Shizuoka's tea.  I was surprised to know this fact. But I often drink coffee than tea, so I wanted to know about coffee. It is interesting and healthy for us for every restaurants and shops to service tea for free because of helping by government. It lead to promote health fitness of the people.  I was so surprised by this news, and I had drunk tea every day, too. However, it is important that we should not drink it too much. Thus, we don't have to drink more tea than now.  I was interested in this topic because this topic told about health. Everyone wants to live healthy. I was surprised at that tea is better for health than water. I do not drink tea everyday. Therefore, I try to drink tea everyday. However, I think that it is important to pay attention to drinking too much is bad for health.  On the face of this article's headline , I thought that ""what a coincidence! How lucky I am!"" Actually, I'm habitual drinker of tea. In terms of health benefits that tea gives us, I knew a little bit like, it'll protect against heart disease and some cancers. But I didn't know the fact that tea can impair the body's ability to absorb iron from food. As remarked in the article, foods containing iron and tea eaten together are said to disagree with you. So I gonna reconsider my habitual drinking of that fluid. And vice versa, I gonna recommend my friends to drink it to keep themselves healthy. It isn't too much to say that this is the age of Health-minded. So intrinsic power of food like this will catch on among people. In terms of business administration, more and more company should take advantage of this aspect, i think. It'll not only benefit company but make Japan the healthiest country in the world.  I am jealous of you, and What a waste!!! I liked green tea so much I could die. I have heard that Shizuoka tea is more delicious than other region tea. I want you to proud of the staple products of Shizuoka!! I was very surprised when I read this article. I still can't believe that drinking three cups of tea a day is as good for you as drinking plenty of water. I can understand that tea may even have extra health benefits. However I am worried that a person who doesn't drink water, drink only tea will appear. I think that drinking water is so important for our health too.  I think so too. Drinking tea is something happiness or routine for us. So we shouldn't make it a habit. Whoever wants to put into practice may try it.  I myself drink cups of tea, and I am pleased to read this article. As this article said, tea has potentials, which shows the prospective that Japanese beverage companies can sell tea products. But, in my experience, drinking too many cups of tea sometimes makes my body heavier. And there are evidences that too much tea causes urolithiasis. so in the long term, I prefer to drink water mainly.  I liked your comments. I once heard the efficacy of the coffee. It also has the lot of benefits, such as activation of the brain, protection against diabetes and so on. But as one of the tea lovers, I wanna praise its efficacy! I think you have a good point. Owing to its benefits, tea can be a big business opportunity, which might lead a win-win relationship between societies and companies.  I was surprised to find to have tea better for a body than I drank water. There is a kind of much in tea. I'd like to have various tea. But the excessive drinking is bad for a body. Caffeine is in tea. There is dependence in caffeine. This discovery is quite good thing, but I think a balance of the amount which drink tea should be considered.  I agree with your opinion completely!! I am worried about that a person who don't drink water appear. However, I also can trust that tea is health for us. So I would try to drink tea much!! You can be convinced your opinion approximately. But please don't forget that we should pay attention to excessive drinking of tea. If I come, the time when a lot of people carry a tumbler with ""tea"" around is fascinating like STARBUCKS COFFEE, isn't it? When I read this article, I was surprised that tea is healthier than water. For a long time, I have a opinion that tea has some negative effects, like a diuretic.

It is nice that your hometown is one of the biggest growing area of tea!!! I disagree with the part of ""Drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese"". Japanese lifestyle is affected by foreign culture, and Japanese lifestyle continues to change. I think that the amount of tea Japanese people drink has been decreasing. So, we cannot sweepingly say that drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese.  I think that tea is familiar with Japanese people. And we enjoy the benefit of tea naturally. Maybe tea take part of Japanese healthy lifestyle. But we cannot sleep when we drink too much tea. So if caffeine less tea are spread wildly in Japan, it is expected that the consumption will increase.  Killing two birds with one stone  is good explanation in this article.

When I read this article, I was very happy and surprised. I decide to drink tea. "
JOC JOC-14B-29N -1.23 "I love British Royal Family's involvement in a wide range of activities that called ""Noblesse oblige. "" Especially Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge are popular and very influential among people. So their activities will make international relations be better one I think.  They are very popular around the world. Their activities are admirable. It is said that Americans like ""royalty "". Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. He devotes himself to government affairs. There are various opinions about royalty. But their attitudes is wonderful.  I like this kind of news very much, especially related to prince William and Catherine because I'm interested in Britain. They are very famous and popular even in Japan but I didn't have enough knowledge about activities by Royal Family's. Therefore, after reading this article, I wanted to search about their activities more and more and could get information! I knew about ""Noblesse oblige"" in detail and I found this idea very nice. Actually, I cannot experience their activities and feelings but I imagine that they have both good points and burdens. I think that ""what they do"" is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world, so in this article, I think it's very nice to visit a child development center and the happening that Catherine was mistaken for being a princess from Frozen made me laugh. As a lot of people pay attention to activities by Royal family, I think they are so admirable and have great meanings. I hope that they can help to promote relationship between countries.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I watched the TV broadcasting of their marriage ceremony in 2011. I felt so, so happy to watch it! And I am looking for seeing their second baby. I want them to come to Tokyo with their children. I believe that their visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  I think their visit to the U. S is not the one which is criticized because the U. S has no royalty and royal family is very popular among American. Indeed there is a serious problem about shooting or choking black guy by white police officer in the U. S, but it's quite irrelevant to the UK and duke and duchess are popular even among black people, for example Lebrone James mentioned above. Therefore, their visit made a good effect on the country, I think.  I also drink tea everyday and I think drinking tea is quite natural in Japan and I'm strongly proud of this custom. He says we have to cherish our custom and I sympathize with his attitude to our grate tradition.  I liked and agreed with your comments. in the era of international exchange, British Royal Familys attitude may become the model for viaduct of peace. Their popularity and sincere attitude will be the model which we should follow. Although some have negative opinion about them but I think they are wonderful and good symbol of UK.  When I read this news, I was very surprised. I am very interested in British royal family. So, this event make me glad. I always thought that people of the non-royal family did not associate with the royal family. By this matter, the way of thinking of people was replaced. Triggered by this, I hope that the relations of all the countries of the world become better.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much, too and I also felt happy. The second baby is born soon. This will bring joy in the world. By this matter, i hope the relationships among many countries become better and better.  This comments said that ""it's wrong for sure to invade human rights. "" I especially sympathized this. I also think Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and PRAJ should change a policy. For these reasons, I strongly agree with this comment.  It's because his opinion is too extreme, that I can't sympathize with his comment. You can't agree to the comment which has only tea. When drinking too much even if it's good for a body, it's bad for a body.  The royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. Originally, I like the British royal family. After I read this article, I like this couple more and more. They have very big power. So, I think that they should use this power for peace of world. Having good relationship become method of the peace. I want them to continue this event.  They are famous all over the world. They are loved and attracted attention by people in the world. Therefore their action is very big influence. This problem was causing a big ripple all over the world. Therefore, I think that I want you to have a good influence not the bad influence. If their power is used to become peaceful in the world, I think that you should be used at many opportunities.  I very love this couple, and they loved a lot of people in the world. I can't wait to see their baby! I hope they will come Japan. And I think Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. Prince William and Catherine's attitudes is very wonderful.  I agree with your opinion. When I watch this couple, I feel happy! I hope they visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  It is because I am same as her opinion ""drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking. "" I think everything is said excessive much as possible too. We should control myself.  The royal couple is very famous in the world and has an enormous influence, so they are being taken notice by the world all of the time. Superficially their life is simply magnificent and bright, not only that, but they live with struggling with a heavy feeling. Their word and action can have a powerful influence on the international situation in a positive and negative way. They are in the terrific position. I anew notice that by read your comment.  British Royal Family is loved by people all over the world. William and Catherine took the world by storm 4 years ago. This time they are given attention, too. I want to know why Royal Family is loved like this.  I like this kind of news. I'm interested in Britain, too! You searched about Royal Family's activities to satisfy your curiosity.

I want them to help restoration of diplomatic relations all of the world.  They are popular and famous all over the world. So they have a great influence on people all over the world. I believe that their visiting can improve relationship of many countries.  In this article, what is important is the easiness. Article says drinking tea in daily life is good. They doesn't mention about how useful it is. I think his comment is way off the mark.  I was interested in his comment. However, he said that he will drink tea only. I am worry about his health. And I want him to understand drinking too much tea is bad for your health. I want tell him that it is not good to be too in everything.  I think so too! Their work is the most peaceful to cooperate nations without any interests. Their actions are likely to be mistaken for easy work. In this case, they received the message ""You want to see our city, but do you care about our problems?"". But I believe their actions make good relationship between british and other countries. I want them to continue this event too.  It's a heart-warming news. Most of the news on this site seem to be very serious, so I was relieved, reading this article. I like them, and wonder when they will visit Japan.  Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing them.  First, I knew this fact before Iread. second, three cups a day is not ""only"" for me.  I am surprised at that so many classmates love Prince William and Catherine!! I also love them very much, too. Their marriage in 2011 was social event on a global scale. Of course, I watched the marriage ceremony on TV. I want Japanese Imperial Household to be loved many people in the world like them. If they have the second baby, I hope their visit to Tokyo with their children. Their visit to countries will make the relationship between the countries better, I think.

I think they can help to improve relationships of many countries.  I think so, too. This news make us calm. I hope they come to Japan! I approve your opinion, too. Behavior of a royal family can have a good impression very much. I'm interested in continuation of an exchange with non-royal family.  I like this news and the British royal couple. They are very famous all over the world and have a great influence of action. For the peace of the world, I want their couple to visit all over the world and contribute to the peace. "
JOC JOC-15B-04N -1.53 "When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Many people and media said that it was difficult for Japan to win this game because South African was the strongest team, so honestly I believed that Japan lost the game. I didn't know rugby very well. However Japan got a dramatic victory and gripped the supporters. As the article said, rugby was a minority sport in Japan, but this victory attracted the interest of many Japanese people. I am the one, too. I felt that I wanted to study the rule of rugby, the players, the history and so on. I would like to support rugby from now on.  I was looking forward to watching this game on TV, but I had something to do, so I couldn't watch. Next morning, I heard that Japan won to South Africa. That news made me surprised and happy. Most of people all over the world thought South Africa which is one of the strongest rugby team win. I am one of them. I think many people again realized that nobody knows what will happen in sports. Japan rugby team proved that. A goal of Japan is to advance to quarterfinal. I believe that Japan will achieve success. Good luck Japan rugby team.  It never occurred to me that Japan beat South Africa. It is said that Rugby needs strong build. Japanese is small in comparison with foreigners. In spite of the disadvantage, Japan beat South Africa. I was deeply moved by this news. Through this article, I think that Japan's victory is a good chance to think about immigration policies. Accepting foreigners has good points. First, we can understand different cultures each other. Second, we will be able to think flexibly. Thanks to foreigners, we learn their thought that we have not recognized so far and come to be able to see things from various angles. We should have interest in immigration policies.  I watched this game that Japan versus South African in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England on Sept. 19. Japan was win so I was very surprised and happy!! So far, Japan was weak, but this year, Japan is very strong. Why did Japan become strong? It is because Japan accepted migration, cross-border marriage and multiple identities. It may be cancel the immigration issues. In recent year, immigration issues is very important problem in Japan. For example half, Korean, Negro and African etc. . . However, they are very successful who is half people. Rui Okoe is baseball player. He is very successful in Koshien. Next, Sani Brown is runner. He runs 200m very fast. So he advanced to the semi-final. In this way, many half people is successful at sports. I think that this is a very good tendency. Half has been discriminated against so far by a Japanese. But I think that it is very wrong. Multi-national culture will be the normal in the future. I accept this culture. I want make some foreign friends. Therefore, I will study English more harder than now. In 2020 Tokyo Olympic, Half people will very successful and get gold-medal!! I knew that South Africa is one of the strongest in rugby. Therefore I was very surprised of Japan's winning the game of the Rugby World Cup in England. And I thought why Japan team became so strong. It's reason is that Japan team accepted foreign player. Before, Japan team has not accepted foreign player. But now, Japan team positively accepts foreign player and reinforces it's power . So this win is important in terms of not only Japan rugby history but also in multi-cultural society.  I was really surprised at this news. I did not think that Japan beat to South Africa and some people looked like not Japanese. Generally speaking, the physique of Japanese people is smaller than people in South Africa. When I watched this game on TV, I felt that Japanese team was constructed from a lot of ethnic people. I thought that it is very amazing thing that Japan which is known to the closed nation adopted not only genuine Japanese players but also players who was born in other countries. In my opinion, a player who has great ability should be joined in the team, so that I really agree with this Japanese attitude toward making team.  I was surprised at this news. In Rugby World Cup, Japan team won South Africa. I watched this game in my house. This news was broadcast like everyday in Japan. Before the game, almost Japanese might think Japan will lose in the game. Because South Africa took third place in the world ranking. But, South Africa was defeated by Japan. It was great. But when I watched this game, I noticed the large number of foreigner player in Japan team. So I research on the Internet. Japan team is composed of 31 people. And 10/31 is foreigner. When I knew this fact, I thought this number is large. So on Twitter, many Japanese tweeted negative opinions about foreigner of Japan team. But, other country's team also have foreigner player. Looking from worldwide, rugby team has foreign player is common. So it is not strange. Why Japan won South Africa? Japanese player are shorter than South Africa. So physical strength may smaller. But I think Japan team exhibit fine teamwork. Now rugby is popular in Japan. So I hope Japan team will more active.  I actually watched the game that Japan won South African in the World Cup 2015. I did not know the detailed rule of rugby, but I was deeply impressed to be present at a moment of the Japan's historic victory. Many Japanese people must take this occasion to be interested in rugby. I am the one, too. Watching the rugby games, I feel that sports have no borders. And, in the feature program about rugby, the Japan Rugby Football Union's spokesman said that rugby goods, the national team's jersey and cheering goods and so on, sold out quickly and the profits were 30% higher than initial target. I was surprised the economic effects. Japan will host the next Rugby World Cup in 2019. I hope the fever will not die with the final whistle of this year's competition.  When Rugby World Cup (RWC) was widely known to a Japanese citizen like this, who would imagine it. If there is all the excellent attack of the representative from Japan. The South African representative victory profit that was said to be ""a rugby upset biggest in history. "" For the great upset that Japan caused, a voice of the praise arose from the South African fan of the U. K. and the opponent, and the representative from Japan alumnus was full of the splendid achievement of younger students. Official Twitter of the World Cup that British writer J. K. Rowling of novel ""Harry Potter"" ""could not write such a story"" at Twitter murmured ""an upset greatest in history of the World Cup"" and surprise. By the way, a rugby athlete representative from Japan has many foreign players, do you know that voices of the praise occur successively in their singing Japanese national anthem ""Kimigayo"" emotionally? I did not learn a text simply and learned with all the players about the meaning and did the action that I sang. Is it not one of the notable points that not only the player from foreign country but also the Japanese player wrestles together? I think that there is the solution to becoming the problem for rugby in this way in the global world.  I also surprised by hearing this news. I decide to support Japan's sports. We have to be responsible to do this together.  Last year we are so excited for rugby. ""Goromaru pose"" is awarded at Buzzwords-of-the-year contest. When I read this article, I was forced to realize that Japan representation doesn't mean all Japanese team. I especially don't know about rugby system, I think most of all are Japanese as a matter of course. Needless to say, The thing that there is a foreigner is not bad thing. I was just simply surprised. Meanwhile, it can be a subject of criticism. As for me, a lot of people don't know this thing I thought. Major reason for admitting this situation is based on rugby's history. For example, in the island country on the South Pacific, a lot of people go out to New Zealand where there is a strong team, ""All Blacks"". We should understand this system of rugby, and then we enjoy to see it. And it is important to be caught by ostensible things, we must think deeply.  I cannot help jumping for joy. Japan's national rugby team which is called ""the Cherry Blossoms"" or ""the Brave Blossoms"" was not very famous. To be frank, I was not interested in Rugby. I did not know how many players play a match, to say nothing of its rules. However, when I heard the news that Japan beat South Africa. I was very impressed and I want to know about Rugby. On September 23rd, Japan played bravely against Scotland, but lost 45-10, though four days earlier, it marked the historic victory over South Africa in 34-32. ""We're not the strongest team out there but we are definitely one of the toughest. I am proud of the boys and we have to look forward to our next game against Samoa, "" said the captain, Michael Leitch. When I read his comment, I thought that they were so cool. Though they were defeated, they always think next game. Even though opponents are stronger than them, they never give up. I was attracted by their positive attitude. After the World Cup was over, I looked them over. To my surprise, their practice is harder than any other national team. They start to practice at 5am and finish practicing at 6pm. They lift weights and stand up to weight of 100kg. It is incredible that they finish the practice schedule. I think it is the secret that they beat South Africa. The practice produced powerful tackle, accurate kick and fast run. Thanks to their practice, they got a good result. The foreign media paid attention to the result of Japan. Japan was defeated in the first league. The foreign media said that it was a loss. Not only the foreign media but also non-Japanese were impressed by Japan team's play. According to the Japanese media, non-Japanese went to support Japan team and bought Japanese shirt. Since Japan team made a deep impression on them, they came to expect victory of Japan. In spite of their disadvantageous build, they made up for their weak point. They proved that they can compensate their weakness with their skill. That is exactly historic splendid achievement. Japan team gave us exciting rugby. Many Japanese thought that Japan team lose, but they made it. I'll never forget this game. I think that the future looks very bright for Japanese Rugby and Japanese Rugby fan. Since they played some fantastic rugby, I am looking forward to 2019 in Japan.  I like seeing a rugby game. Rugby had not been played, but my father and younger brother were doing, and I came to like rugby for the influence. Rugby is ability difference was a clear sport, and Japan won 1 by rugby World Cup so far, rugby had not been done. Because such team won against a team of a 3rd place of the world rank, I was quite moved. Japanese representative also kept making a leap attack after that, and I won 3 by this meet. I think that's a really wonderful thing. Japanese representative's players were saying that everyone changed history of Japanese rugby. And the players who accomplished that think it's wonderful. I'd like to follow them and make an effort, too. And I'm hoping to want them to play an active part for future Japanese rugby.  I was so surprised at this historical achievement. Everyone says rugby of Japanese who are much smaller than other countries like New Zealand cannot win. But, they overcome not only South Africa but also the prejudice to Brave Blossoms. I respect their courage and tough in a pinch. When I was a junior high school student, I got to like rugby because rugby team of our school were playing next to our ground of baseball team. I was watching their playing while the time of club activities. I usually recall their tackle and scrimmage were desperately. I think they may be glad of Japanese rugby was recognized by the world. Before rugby World Cup in last year, rugby is minority sport in Japan, but now many people may be attracted by their brave figures. Most popular player in Brave Blossoms is Ayumu Goromaru. I think his wonderful point is of course technique of rugby and furthermore having the spiritual of wish that Japanese should watch rugby more. So, I respect him. By the way, I wondered why Japanese team has the players who are other races. I thought they are not obviously Japanese. But, when I asked my friend who loves rugby, I can understand the reason. There are three conditions. At first, to born in Japan. Secondly, only one person in their grandparents and parents is from Japan. Thirdly, they stay more than three years in Japan. These conditions are so easy for players. However, we never forget foreigners desperately play for Japan. I think their thoughts for Japan are much stronger than ours.  Actually, I Watched live on TV about this major historical victory of Japan team. At first , I couldn't imagine that Japan defeated South Africa, but move of Japan team is highly organized and no one neglect each work. The match was so exciting and Both team played well to win the game. Japan team players are smaller than those of South Africa, so they tackled in low position. Therefore they could face opponents. At the end of the game , Japan team Got penalty. If Japan team was willing to draw, they just kicked the ball, but they aimed victory. Japan team never gave up fighting and at last they scored. This winning is due to all members including reserve members, staffs , and coach. I was surprised to hear that players who don't have nationality of Japan can fight with Japan team members . I understood that rugby has no border. There is famous saying, ""One for all, all for one"". It simply represents style of rugby. This kind of thought is important not only do sports but also other thing. Following this example of Japan team can make our society better.  I agree with your opinion. It is often overlooked that Japan is multi-cultural society. It is because Japan is island country and therefore reluctant to accept other nation's people. Japan should change that kind of thought and accept many kind of people who are from foreign countries . That can bring Japan more benefit. The example of Japan rugby team is the key to advance Japanese multi-cultural society. Of course, Japanese people should go abroad more positively. When you are exposed to other culture, you can gain many benefits and can get wider vision.  I am not a big fun of Rugby at all. But I am so glad that Japan played really good in 2015 Rugby World Cup. Since they played good enough to get attention by mass media and Japanese people, there will be awesome thing coming for the players. Now they are famous and are able to earn money than they used to be by appearing on television commercials and so on. I remember exactly same thing happened in 2011 when Japanese team won the first place in FIFA women's World Cup. Basically for those sports players who are not famous, it is so difficult to live only by playing sports. It is not rare to have the part-time job in the company. First, whoever gets the first place gets 1 million dollars as a prize by FIFA. And then there will be a lot of people who goes to see their domestic league game in Japan. So winning in the national game is so important. I hope that this Rugby-movement last longer and I wish of them keep playing really good for a long time.  Your comment is so interesting. What you want to say is half people can play sports better than Japanese, but they have discriminated against by Japanese, so we must recognize them. I can understand your comment and I agree with you. However, I think this seems to be off the point. The reason why Brave Blossoms have foreign players is the rule of international. You commented that Japan accepted migration, cross-border and multiple identities. I think it is misunderstanding. It is certain of there are many players of other races. They have stronger love to Japan than ours.  We should be proud of our Japanese rugby team for the win against South Africa. I thought that rugby is minor sports, but once they got a big won, it became worldwide news. This proved that sports is the one thing that clearly grabs our heart. We should encourage more activities also to cheer Japanese people and economy since it is proved. I hope sports will be one of the things that will prevent war in the future.  Rugby World Cup (RWC) 2015 pool B, a game with Japan in South Africa were carried out in southern Brighton and raised large Venus which broke South Africa of the world ranking third place that Japan which there was not of the win boasted of championship of the past twice to in RWC for 24 years with 34 - 32. I accomplish the in history RWC's greatest upset, and Japan which made start that it is with the last eight to aim for, and there is no longer it invites the game with Scotland of the pool B second war on 23rd in a severe schedule called middle 3rd. On September 19, 2015, it is Brighton community stadium. The Eddie Jones representative from Japan head coach acted and declared it calmly while the lingering sound that approximately 30, 000 large audiences were fuddled with the in history RWC's greatest upset was left. ""The history just changed"" I watched this game too. Rugby is ability difference was a clear sport, and Japan won 1 by rugby World Cup so far, rugby had not been done. Because such team won against a team of a 3rd place of the world rank, I was quite moved. Japanese representative also kept making a leap attack after that, and I won 3 by this meet. I think that's a really wonderful thing. Japanese representative's players were saying that everyone changed history of Japanese rugby. And the players who accomplished that think it's wonderful. I'd like to follow them and make an effort, too. And I'm hoping to want them to play an active part for future Japanese rugby.  When I heard this news on TV, I couldn't believe that the rugby team of Japan won South African team in the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England on Sept. 19. Nobody thought that Japan team won, before the game. However, rugby is eyed as exciting sports to all Japanese people now. Goromaru who is a member of Japan's team of rugby, have a routine. It is known as ""Goromaru Pose"". I do short track speed skating. But this sports is not known to people enough. Yui Sakai who is the player of short track, is the strongest player in Japan. So, I hope that she get gold medal in the Olympic Games, And then this sports is known more to many people. "
ACA ACA-ALP-001 -0.11 "a Non-punitive Paradigm of Probation Practice: Some Sobering Thoughts L.R. SINGER Lawrence Singer is an Assistant Chief Probation Officer with Merseyside Probation Service. Beforehand he worked as a probation officer for Berkshire Probation Service and later as a research officer for Somerset Probation Service where he undertook the research reported here. The paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book Adult Probation and Juvenile Supervision: Beyond the Care-Control Dilemma (1989, Gower). SUMMARY The Government White Paper Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public proposes a radical change for probation practice. Henceforth probation work will no longer be an alternative to punishment but an alternative form of punishment. This article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context. Probation officers, it is argued, are concerned with establishing rules for probationers and not inflicting pain on them. An alternative non-punitive paradigm of probation practice is described. The paradigm is based on the joint supervisory aims of support and surveillance which are implemented through the methods of counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring. To illustrate the paradigm, reference is made to an alcohol education course developed for offenders in trouble through drink. The efficacy of the alcohol project and the non-punitive paradigm is demonstrated by the results reported from a three year evaluation study covering 152 offenders. The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness. The aim of this article is to challenge the assertion contained in the White Paper Crime, Justice and Protecting the Public (Home Office, 1990a) that probation practice can be conceived of as a form of punishment in the community. Issue will be taken with the appropriateness of applying the concept of punishment to the probation context through reference to a demanding and successful probation project concerned   with offenders in trouble through drink. In describing the project, a non-punitive model for understanding probation practice will be developed. This non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into ‘a new approach to punishment in the community’(p. 18, para. 4.3). The punitive approach anticipated for the Probation Service in the White Paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides ‘in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders’. The White Paper goes on to emphasize: ‘It is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order rather than the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment’(p. 18, para. 4.4). Notwithstanding the popular appeal and political capital to be derived from such a humane-sounding statement, this definition is nevertheless at variance with the traditional understanding of the meaning of punishment. Discourses on punishment and dictionary definitions of the term clearly specify the central feature of punishment as being the infliction of pain rather than the loss of liberty per se (Hudson, 1987). The conceptual and practical implications of this discrepancy will be examined in the third and final section of this article. Beforehand, however, consideration will be given first to the probation project and second to its evaluation. In these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment. At a time when the Home Secretary is inviting the Probation Service to ‘move centre stage in the Criminal Justice System’(NACRO, 1990, p. 17) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the White Paper's notion of punishment. Punishment is just a word after all: nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the ‘window of opportunity’. However, this fails to acknowledge a fundamental axiom of social work practice; namely that language not only reflects but also shapes social reality. As Davies (1981) has pointed out, speech is the basic tool of the social worker. What we say influences what we think and in turn, what we do. If punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service undertakes. In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put ‘Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain?’ and the answer which unfolds may be summarized ‘No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to!’ THE PROJECT: MORE DEMANDING THAN PUNISHMENT Government concern about the problem of drink-related offending is as old as the Probation Service. Indeed, as Bochel (1976) has shown, the establishment of a Probation Service in England and Wales was inextricably linked with work undertaken with offenders in trouble through drink. Almost a century later the new approach to punishment in the community outlined by the White Paper once again presents alcohol misuse as a key problem requiring community-based intervention. ‘Alcohol’, the White Paper states, ‘is implicated in a wide variety of crimes, drunken driving, offences of public disorder and domestic violence’(p. 21, para. 4. 14). In describing its vision of effective supervision the White Paper goes on to note: offenders take part in alcohol education programmes so that they can learn to drink sensibly. They learn about the relative strength of different drinks, the amount which is safe to consume, and the pitfalls to avoid (e.g. competitive drinking and buying ‘rounds’)(p. 37, para. 7.11). As a summary of alcohol education programmes, this is something of a simplification. However it does provide a useful introduction to the origins of the Alcohol Education Course reported here. Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice. In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol (Singer, 1985). Aware of practitioners' frustration in not being able to work effectively with these problematic clients, Probation management, in partnership with the voluntary sector, determined to develop an Alcohol Education Course (AEC). By 1986, when social inquiry report monitoring information covering 1,257 offenders indicated that the problem of drink-related offending was virtually as great for pre- as for post-sentence clients, that is, alcohol was cited as a pre-offence problem in twenty-nine per cent of cases, a specialist project worker had been appointed. Towards the end of 1986 an AEC was launched and has been running ever since. The aim of the course is to educate offenders about alcohol to facilitate a lasting change in their subsequent use of this drug. This aim is underpinned by three interrelated objectives and it is not without significance how they complement and serve to implement the White Paper's own trinity of ‘aims of supervision’, that is, protection of  the public, prevention of reoffending and successful reintegration of the offender in the community (p. 35, para. 7.3). These were: 1. To increase knowledge about alcohol so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent. 2. To instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour. 3. To encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake. To meet these objectives the AEC has a structured programme involving group and individual contact, that is, six group sessions sandwiched between one-to-one interviews held immediately before and after the group contact . The initial one-to-one meeting, held with one of the two group leaders, serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them. A standard contract which covers conditions of attendance and an agreement to complete various assignments between group sessions is signed by each participant. The final interview entails a personalized review of the course, as well as the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer. The course employs a variety of materials and techniques including the use of checklists, magazine and newspaper clippings, quizzes, videos, brainstorm exercises, discussions, drink diaries, and role plays (Menary, 1986). The AEC is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance (Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982) and reflects the fact that most Somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and/or possess a substantial number of previous convictions. In short, they are seriously at risk of committing further offences and becoming trapped in the revolving door of custody. The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office's recent guidance to sentencers: In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders. Probation orders which are combined with constructive, disciplined and effective programmes of supervision are increasingly being used for offenders who stand to receive custodial sentences (1990b, p. 35). From the description of the AEC already given the demanding and disciplined nature of the course can be appreciated. However, the course is not punitive; it is not concerned with the infliction of pain. Instead, it is concerned with the establishment of rules. This is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out: You will be expected to keep a drink diary throughout the course, and make  attempts at reducing the amount you drink if it is greater than accepted healthy drinking levels. You must be willing to be helped and help others — your experiences will be useful to other group members. You must attend 8 sessions (these will consist of: an introductory session, six group sessions and a final assessment interview). You must not drink before the session. You must be on time — lateness will count as an absence. Unlike the prison inmate, AEC participants cannot sit back and passively do their time. Probation practice is not, however, solely concerned with the establishment of rules. As has been demonstrated elsewhere with regard to the generic probation setting (Singer, 1989), the supervision of offenders involves two overarching aims: namely support and surveillance. Support refers to anything which is said or done to help the offender solve or mitigate their personal or social problems: surveillance to anything which is said or done to induce the offender to conform to socially acceptable standards of behaviour. These aims are implemented through the practice of four distinguishable but related methods. In terms of support, there is counselling and assisting: in terms of surveillance, there is directing and monitoring. Each of these four methods are employed during the eight sessions. Although summarized as an alcohol education course, the sessions are not just concerned with giving information but also with enabling participants to make practical use of it. In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes (Menary, 1986) by the explanation: ‘This session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past’(p. 3). During this session the importance of monitoring is also emphasized: Drinks exercises introduce the notion of measurement, concentration of alcohol content; information which will be necessary to carry out the recording of alcohol consumption throughout the duration of the course (p. 3). In the fifth group session entitled ‘Focus on the Individual’, the counselling and the monitoring combine with the directing and assisting methods. At the start of the session the tutor's notes make clear that directing extends beyond enforcing the conditions of attendance: This session allows for an in depth examination of the drinking diaries over the last five weeks — identifying the risky circumstances or situations…. The aim at the end of the session is to encourage participants to make rules for their future drinking which will lead to a lessening of identified problems (p. 4). Similarly, the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information: It is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively ‘pub centred’ problems. The use of role play, incorporating previously discussed difficulties (i.e. homework assignment session 4) in ‘real’ or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills. Probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion. In the second half of the session, course leaders sponsor participants to an evening at the pub for the purpose of practising drinking skills and purchasing non-alcoholic drinks. The counselling, assisting, directing, and monitoring on the AEC give substance to the aims of support and surveillance and provide the basis for establishing a model of probation practice. Punishment has no place in this model. Instead the AEC can best be understood as an example of a non-punitive paradigm of probation practice. Twenty years ago the Advisory Council on the Penal System observed that notions of punitiveness do not accord with ‘the British concept of probation as an alternative to, rather than a suspension of, punishment’(quoted in Bochel, 1976, p. 238). Twenty years later the AEC demonstrates that this remains no less true now than it was then. But does the AEC work? THE EVALUATION: MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PUNISHMENT According to Home Office statistics, probation practice is more efficient and no less effective than imprisonment. At 1988/89 rates (Home Office, 1990b, p. 110), it cost on average £288 per week to keep an offender in custody, compared with £19 per week to supervise an offender on probation; yet the Home Office acknowledge: ‘It is hard to show any effect that one type of sentence is more likely than any other to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, which is high for all’(p. 7). If anything can be shown, it would appear that probation is more effective than prison in reducing the risk of further offending. In a review of reconviction rates, for example, a Home Office report concluded: ‘Those given probation orders were therefore less likely to be reconvicted within two years of being given probation than those released from custody’(Home Office, 1986, p. 5). Methodological objections could be made to comparing the two groups because of the different periods of time monitored, that is, for prisoners the period of time refers to after the sentence has been served whereas for probationers it is after the sentence has been imposed. Moreover, it could be argued that prisoners are more at risk of further offences than probationers because of, first, their commission of relatively more serious offences, and second, their more extensive and therefore more entrenched criminal careers. This may be so for the population of probationers generally but does not apply to the AEC sample. As noted earlier, the AEC was designed for offenders at risk of further offending and/or custody. Between 1986 and 1988 152 offenders undertook the AEC while simultaneously being monitored to assess the impact of the course upon them. As a sample of offenders, the course participants have more in common with prisoners than probationers. In Table 1 below a comparison of the offences committed by the sample and those committed by persons commencing probation or entering custody nationally is given. Whereas for theft and fraud type offences there were almost twice as many commencing probation nationally as amongst the AEC participants, the reverse was true for violence, burglary and criminal damage type offences. The similarity between the AEC participants and offenders entering custody — rather than persons commencing probation nationally — is clearly shown by the identical proportions each group recorded for violent offences. Furthermore, the greater proportion of other indictable offences for the AEC sample, compared with probationers nationally, reflected the large number of drink-driving offenders, that is, 25. Given this array of serious offences committed by the AEC sample it is not surprising that the average number of previous   convictions was seven, with only 10 per cent having no previous convictions compared with 28 per cent who had ten or more. In this connection it is relevant to note that 84 per cent of the sample had consumed alcohol prior to the commission of their current offences and three out of four of the convictions for previous offences had been drink-related. The possibility that the sample's previous convictions simply reflected persistent petty offending can be discounted because over a third had already received a custodial sentence (37 per cent); a further fifth community service (20 per cent ); and nearly another fifth a probation or supervision order (17 per cent ). Most of the sample were male (94 per cent), aged between seventeen and twenty-four (61 per cent ) and the risk of further offending and custody is highlighted by the fact that over half of the sample had committed an offence within a year of the current offence. In Somerset the management of the Probation Service has reached an agreement with the local and neighbouring courts that Schedule 11 probation orders, that is, orders containing day centre or specified activity requirements, are operated as a direct alternative to custody. In this light the at-risk status of the sample is further indicated by the fact that 91 per cent of the sample were subject to Schedule 11, with only six per cent being on ordinary probation and three per cent on statutory licence following release from custody, that is, parole and youth custody licence. The large proportion of schedule 11 cases in the AEC sample contrasts dramatically with the proportion commencing probation nationally in 1988, that is, 63 per cent of the AEC's probationers were subject to a day centre requirement compared with only six per cent nationally; similarly, 31 per cent of the AEC probationers were subject to a specified activity requirement compared with only six per cent nationally (Home Office, 1990c, p. 46). The more highly convicted and at-risk profile of the AEC sample was also reflected by the fact that whereas nationally as many as 80 per cent of the persons commencing probation in 1988 had no additional requirements made to their probation orders, only six per cent of the probationers undertaking the AEC received this traditional type of probation order from the courts. The evaluation of the AEC was based upon a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which the course was able to achieve its stated objectives. This involved the collection and analysis of five different types of information: an alcohol knowledge test, a drink profile questionnaire, a drink diary, a consumer questionnaire and reconviction rate statistics. The nature of the method, its relation to course objectives and the results obtained are described below. As will gradually become evident, the AEC has proven itself to be an unambiguous success. ALCOHOL KNOWLEDGE TEST The alcohol knowledge test (AKT) is a twenty item multiple choice test of alcohol knowledge. Each question, like the course overall, is practical in focus and concerned with information about the relative strength of different alcoholic drinks, detoxification times, legal limits and medical effects. The purpose of the test is to provide an objective basis for assessing the nature and extent of participants' alcohol knowledge before and after doing the course. Accordingly, the AKT was administered during the first and last of the group sessions and constituted a straightforward method for evaluating the success of the first course objective: specifically, to increase participants' alcohol knowledge so that future alcohol use can be more informed and therefore more prudent. It will probably not surprise the reader to learn that at the outset of the course serious gaps in participants' knowledge were identified. For example, over half of the participants (56 per cent ) did not know how many beers they could drink before reaching the legal limit for driving and well over two-thirds of them knew neither how long it took for alcohol to be burned up by the body (71 per cent ) nor what, if anything, was an effective way of sobering up (71 per cent ). However, by the conclusion of the course over three-quarters of the sample knew the beer equivalent to the legal limit (77 per cent); the correct detoxification time (78 per cent ); and the fact that there is no effective way to accelerate the detoxification process (79 per cent )— including a cold shower or a cup of strong coffee! When the sample's average score out of twenty was calculated, it revealed an increase from 9.5 to 14.3 out of twenty. This means that there was an overall increase in the participants' alcohol knowledge between the start and the finish of the course of 50.5 per cent: not abstract knowledge, but knowledge that is relevant to drinking with associates in the pub or elsewhere. To test whether each of the participants' before and after scores were simply a fluke occurrence, as distinct from a genuine increase in alcohol knowledge, a Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test was undertaken using SPSS and the result proved statistically significant, that is, Z= -10. 1839, 2-tailed, P=0.0000. DRINK PROFILE QUESTIONNAIRE It does not necessarily follow that knowing more about alcohol will automatically result in more responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, that is, the second course objective. Participants could, for example, attempt to make their attitudes consonant with their recently acquired knowledge only to find themselves unable to break from their  established pattern of behaviour (Festinger, 1957). To measure the extent to which the AEC was able to successfully anticipate and overcome this potential problem a drink profile questionnaire (DPQ) was devised and administered before and after the course. The DPQ is a Likert-style schedule comprising five possible answers attracting a score of between one and five points for twenty-five different questions concerned with key aspects of drinking attitudes and behaviour. When completing the DPQ participants were told that, unlike the AKT, there were no right answers. Regarding attitudes, participants were invited to rank from strongly agree (five points) to strongly disagree (one point) their level of agreement with statements such as‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’ and ‘If you limit the amount you drink, it spoils your enjoyment’. Regarding behaviour, participants were asked to indicate from always (five points) to never (one point) the frequency of instances occurring where, for example, they got drunk even when they did not intend to; their drinking left them short of cash; they drank to help themselves deal with a crisis; and they missed meals because they wanted to drink instead. The participants' answers were scored and their grand totals then checked against where they fell on a continuum of five risk levels ranging from very low to very high. Whereas in the AKT an upward trend is indicative of success, the reverse is true for the DPQ, that is, the lowering of risk level represents a shift towards having instilled or reinforced responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour. It was precisely this type of downward shift that was recorded. Between the first and the second DPQ over three-quarters of the participants either reduced to (72 per cent) or remained at (six per cent ) a medium or low level of risk. To assess whether this before — after difference was merely a fluke occurrence the Wilcoxon Test was undertaken and the result proved statistically significant, that is, Z=-7.7565, 2-tailed, P=0.0000. Bearing in mind the course leaders' concern to instil or reinforce responsible drinking attitudes and behaviour, it is worth noting that before the course 77 per cent of the participants agreed with the statement ‘To enjoy yourself, it is necessary to have something to drink’; yet by the end of the course 88 per cent disagreed with this attitude. Similarly, whereas over half of the sample (57 per cent) admitted to always or mostly continuing to drink even when they knew they were intoxicated, at the end of the course 60 per cent said this rarely or never occurred. DRINK DIARY The third objective of the AEC is to encourage the maintenance of, or, where appropriate, a reduction to a personally and socially safe level of alcohol unit intake. Determining how much is too much is debatable but authoritative (if somewhat tough) guidelines have been set by Alcohol Concern in consultation with the Health Education Council and the medical professions (Alcohol Concern, 1986, p. 5). Three levels of alcohol consumption are specified: low, moderate, and high. Males consuming over 36 units of alcohol a week and females consuming more than 22 units have a high level and are advised to cut down immediately. AEC participants were required to keep a weekly drink diary after each of the group sessions to monitor their drinking levels. Although it must be acknowledged that there is a danger of deliberate under-recording, the emphasis placed by the course on the value and importance of being honest with oneself appears to have resolved this problem. The non-punitive approach of the course is reflected in its policy neither to reward low scores nor to punish underscoring. This is because the aim of the exercise is to provide the participants with a practical tool for monitoring their drinking: if they want to cheat, they will only be cheating themselves. In this connection the comments from two of the participants were typical. The first time I went he got us to do a drink diary and I know I didn't tell the truth. I put down a bit less than I had been drinking. I don't know why I did that. I thought ‘What's the other person going to put down, is he going to do the same? Well I don't want to be seen drinking more than he is!’ As the group went on I was being truthful, I put down what I was drinking. The two lads that were with me at the end, they were being truthful. Theirs went down but mine went up. These drink diaries are excellent, brilliant way as long as nobody cheats. You're only cheating yourself when you cheat. They were easy to do. Information from the drink diaries, based on a comparison of the averages for the first and the last three weeks of the course, revealed a shift from high to moderate drinking levels for males, that is, from 40 to 32 units per week. The nine females who undertook the course remained within the high zone but nevertheless registered a reduction from an average of 39 units to 28 units per week. Overall, almost three-quarters of the participants either reduced their intake (61 per cent) or remained at the same level (11 per cent ) between the first and the last three weeks of the course. Using the Wilcoxon test this downward trend was again found to be statistically significant, that is, Z= — 4.9595, 2 — tailed, P= 0–0000. CONSUMER FEEDBACK After completing the AEC, participants were interviewed to provide them with an opportunity to reflect and comment on the course. Interviews were conducted by the research officer or the alcohol project worker (instead of the course leaders) to ensure confidentiality; and a semi-structured interview guide was used. The guide covered questions about the participants' expectations, experience and evaluation of the course. The interview transcripts run to some 121 pages and can only be superficially summarized here. However, five points of direct relevance to the success of the course and the applicability of the non-punitive paradigm warrant a brief mention. First, out of all the responses made, only two participants stated that their attendance on the course had not been worthwhile and none said that the course should be discontinued. Second, the vast majority of participants were able to indicate the practical, as distinct from abstract, usefulness of the course. With regard to drinking and driving for example: I've learnt a lot, my job depends on me driving and it's made me realise how much I can drink, how much I can't drink, what I can drink and realising about road accidents. The amount you drink does affect your driving quite considerably Third, different aspects of the course appeared to cater for different needs. For some the counselling was particularly appreciated: A lot more knowledge, it made you think a lot more about what you were doing really. For others it was the assistance that was especially useful: When we all went to the pub and some of them went up and got non-alcoholic drinks and that, and they all said they couldn't go into a pub and do that and they done it, no problem. I think it was useful going to the pub. Fourth, many participants frankly admitted that they had very low expectations at the outset: specifically that the course was simply designed to punish them, in return for which they would give the minimum amount of attention possible. All agreed that this was not Their experience as the following comments clearly demonstrate: I thought they were out to get me to be honest with you. I thought they were out to get me as a punishment. But I don't think so now. He was just telling us and you learn. You've gotta face it haven't you, you've gotta face it whatever. If you don't face anything, you don't get anywhere. I was frightened. I thought it was going to be worse than it was. It was good once  it got going. I didn't think we would have the opportunity to say things — we all got a chance to speak. I really thought it was going to be sort of‘You must not drink ever again' and ‘You naughty boy, you mustn't do it ever again' sort of thing. I had the idea that it was going to be ‘Do this, do that’ but it wasn't like that. Finally (and in direct accord with the non-punitive approach of the course), the emphasis upon participants by the end of the course making their own rules — as opposed to them being made by others — was greatly appreciated. My rules are to cut down drinking, control my temper if I am drinking, not to drink in a such a large group and not to waste much money. It's a good idea, you should set yourself your own targets so you can know. RECONVICTION RATE STATISTICS Positive test results and favourable feedback might be sufficient evaluation criteria outside of the Criminal Justice System but reconviction rates for probation practice must remain the acid test. Before and after course results are important indices of immediate impact, but did participants manage to keep out of trouble with the law twelve months after completing the course? Thanks to the assistance of the statistics department of Avon and Somerset Police, it was possible to answer this question and provide a fifth and final indicator of success. In spite of the high risk profile of the participants, that is, an average of seven previous and often recent convictions (see above), 95 or 63 per cent of the sample were not recorded as having committed further offences during the twelve month follow-up. In other words, almost two out of three of the participants had kept away from further trouble through drink. As one participant observed: Yea, drinking's always got me into trouble in the past, I mean now I've thought about it, I've thought what a stupid idiot I'd be, so you know if it wasn't for the course, then I probably would have gone and done it again, you know, without a second thought. Without the benefit of the results from a random allocation study based on experimental and control groups, second thoughts about how much of the two out of three success rate can be directly attributed to the AEC are inevitable. However, Phillpotts and Lancucki's (1979) authoritative study for the Home Office on reconviction rates offers a basis for provisional optimism. In their six year follow-up study of 5,000 offenders convicted of standard list offences in January 1971, they reported that: Offenders who were reconvicted within the follow-up period were likely to have  their first reconviction fairly soon after sentence (or, for those given custodial sentences, after discharge). Offenders with a large number of previous convictions were not only more likely to be reconvicted but were reconvicted sooner than those with few previous convictions (1979, p. 41). What is of particular relevance to the AEC sample is Phillpott and Lancucki's finding that 53 per cent of all male offenders with five or more preconvictions were reconvicted within a year (1979, p. 24). If the AEC had made no difference to the male participants with five or more preconvictions we would expect over half of them to have been reconvicted. However, as might be anticipated from the progress registered earlier in connection with improvements regarding alcohol knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, instead of 53 per cent only 42 per cent of the ‘five or more’ male offenders were reconvicted. DISCIPLINE: MORE APPROPRIATE THAN PUNISHMENT The idea espoused in the White Paper that restrictions on liberty will become ‘the connecting thread in a range of community penalties as well as custody’(p. 19, para. 4.5) is conceptually flawed for two basic reasons. First, if restriction on liberty is the defining feature of punishment, what are we to make of the experience of children who have to go to school and adults who have to work for a living? Is their liberty not being restricted in terms of both intention and effect? For example, employers and teachers keep registers of attendance and prescribe as well as supervise the activities of their employees/pupils, that is , restriction by intent. Moreover, children attending school and adults turning up for work inevitably have their liberty restricted: simply because the engagement in one activity necessarily restricts their opportunity to participate in other activities, that is, restriction by effect. It is patently absurd to regard attendance at school or work per se as a punishment. Second, the notion of a continuum of restriction ranging from community penalties to custody — neat as it sounds — fails to acknowledge the unique and painful experience of imprisonment. As Sykes (1971) has shown, confinement to and within a prison entails a number of pains. These involve physical, financial, and psychological hardships including the loss of liberty, goods and services, heterosexual relationships, autonomy, security and life chances post-custody. Lest anyone doubt the validity of these observations in England and Wales, consider the following admission about a custodial sentence from the Home Office: It is likely to affect an offender's personal or financial prospects. There is the possibility that serious hardship will be inflicted on the offender's family, particularly those responsible for the care of young children…. On release from custody, it can be very difficult for the offender to be reintegrated into the community. Furthermore, tor the young or inexperienced offender, mixing with more sophisticated inmates may deepen his anti-social attitudes and increase his criminal skills (1990b, pp. 8–9). Probation practice cannot legitimately be placed on this sort of continuum. The description and evaluation of the AEC clearly demonstrates that, in their particular sphere of constructive influence, probation officers, like employers and teachers, are concerned in part with the establishment of rules and not the infliction of pain. Put another way, it is discipline, not punishment, which constitutes the connecting thread running through the diverse range of probation practice. This point was made by one commentator during the first review of the ‘Probation System’ at the beginning of this century: his comments remain pertinent for the Home Office in their current review at the end of the century. Probation…is a test or trial of the character of a convicted offender under suspension of judgment, in order that the court may determine if the probationer be fit to retain his or her place as a helpful member of society, or being unfit, must be deprived of his or her liberty as a menace to society. It is established for the purpose of correction and oversight. It is a conditional freedom. It recognises that the newer and better way to govern the law-breaker is not through the expiring system of the cell and the lash, but rather through the mind and the heart (Bridgwater, 1909, p. 9). The punitive calculus, with its just deserts gloss, may have political appeal and offer an antidote to the soft image that has beset the Service since its inception. However, this is to mistake not only the demanding nature of current practice but also the non-punitive knowledge, skills, and values which provide for its success. The AEC is but one example of a number of fruitful initiatives undertaken by practitioners in and through the medium of counselling, assisting, directing and monitoring. The non-punitive approach of probation officers is a strength rather than a weakness. Some years ago the ‘Nothing Works’ school of thought dominated the Probation Service. Now it seems that some things work, especially those like the AEC that are associated with what has come to be described as the problem-focused/task-centred approach (Roberts, 1990). These new ways of working are simply a consolidation of the established pattern among officers of personalizing their practice, that is, carefully matching their particular social work knowledge and skills to the unique needs of  the individual offender (Singer, 1989). This trend reflects a developing and successful specificity of probation practice: the pity is that this specificity of practice has not been complemented by a more appropriate specificity of language from the authors of the White Paper."
ACA ACA-B2K-001 -0.0299999999999998 "SINGULARITY STRUCTURE It has been seen that singularities inevitably occur in the solutions describing the interaction region of colliding plane waves. Using the line element (6.20), we have in this region  (8.1) where f(u) and g(v) are monotonically decreasing functions for positive arguments. It is therefore inevitable that some kind of singularity will occur on the hypersurface f + g = 0. It can also be seen from (6.17), that this is the hypersurface on which the two opposing waves mutually focus each other, as the contraction of each wave here becomes unbounded. This was anticipated by the discussion in Section 5.3. It is now appropriate to consider whether the caustics formed in this way correspond to mere coordinate singularities, or whether they are necessarily curvature singularities as they are in the Khan-Penrose solution. It has also been pointed out previously that coordinate singularities necessarily occur in the regions II and III that contain the approaching waves. The character and significance of these singularities must also be considered in this chapter. 8.1 Singularities According to the general theory of relativity, space-time is represented by a connected C ∞ Hausdorff manifold M together with a locally Lorentz metric g . A singularity in the space-time is indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration (Hawking and Ellis, 1973). By definition, space-time is smooth and does not contain any irregular points. It follows that a singularity may normally be considered as occurring only at a boundary of space-time. Unfortunately, no single definition of a singularity has yet been found which is applicable to all situations. One of the more useful ways of attaching a boundary to a singular space-time is by a b (bundle) -boundary construction. The b -boundary  is the projection into a space-time of a natural boundary attached to a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In the standard b -boundary construction, the Riemannian manifold is the bundle of frames over space-time having a positive definite metric induced by the affine connection. Boundary points of the frame bundle are determined by giving end points to all Cauchy sequences which do not converge in the frame bundle. The bundle boundary is then projected down to make a boundary for the space-time. According to the classification scheme devised by Ellis and Schmidt (1977), singularities in maximal, four-dimensional space-times can be divided into three basic types: quasiregular, non-scalar curvature and scalar curvature. This scheme describes the singularity structure of a space-time  on which the Riemann tensor is C k . It uses a b -boundary construction to determine the location of singular points. If the b -boundary is non-empty, there are only two possibilities. Either a point q in the b -boundary may be a  regular boundary point if the space-time  can be embedded in a larger space-time  such that the Riemann tensor is C r and q is an interior point in , or it may be a  singular boundary point if the space-time  is not extendable through q in a  way. A singular boundary point q can then be classified according to this scheme. It may be a C k (or C k- )quasiregular singularity if all components of the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives evaluated in an orthonormal frame parallel propagated along an incomplete geodesic ending at q are C (or C 0- ). Such frames are called PPON frames. It may alternatively be a C k (or C k- ) curvature singularity if this is not true. In this case it may either be categorized as a C k (or C k- )non-scalar curvature singularity if all scalars in the metric tensor , the alternating symbol , the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives are bounded, that is, tend to a C (or C -) function. Alternatively, it may be a C k (or C k- )scalar curvature singularity or a scalar polynomial curvature singularity if some scalar does not tend to a C (or C -) function. The most familiar class of singularities are the scalar curvature singularities. These include the ‘big bang’ and ‘black hole’types of singularity which closely correspond to one's intuitive concept of a real physical singularity. As such a singularity is approached, some physical quantities diverge and all observers feel unbounded tidal forces. The non-scalar curvature and quasiregular singularities are much less well understood and have been less fully investigated. Consider, for example, a space-time with a non-scalar curvature singularity. No curvature scalars diverge in this case, yet some components of the Riemann tensor evaluated in a PPON frame along an incomplete curve do not tend to  finite limits as the singularity is approached. The physical effect of this is that all test particles which fall into the non-scalar curvature singularity feel infinite tidal forces, but observers can move arbitrarily close to the singularity on other curves and feel no untoward effects. Finally, consider a space-time with a quasiregular singularity. In all reasonable frames the Riemann tensor is completely finite. In this case, observers near a quasiregular singularity, including those who fall into the singularity itself, do not feel unbounded tidal forces. All three types of singularity are found in colliding plane wave solutions. In the following sections and chapters the singularity and global structure of particular solutions will be analysed in more detail. The singularity in region IV In the exact solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) described in Chapter 3, there is a scalar curvature singularity in region IV on the hypersurface . However, it is not clear whether or not this type of singularity will occur in other solutions, particularly as the Khan-Penrose solution contains impulsive gravitational waves. This question has been considered by Szekeres (1972), who found that, for colliding gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization, a curvature singularity is inevitable. This work was generalized by Sbytov (1976) to plane gravitational waves with arbitrary polarization, with the same result. However, more recently, counterexamples to these conclusions have been obtained, in the non-aligned case by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986c), and in the aligned case by a degenerate solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987b) and by the algebraically general solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez (1989). In these cases, the curvature scalars remain bounded on the hypersurface , and scalar polynomial curvature singularities occur in the extensions of the solution through the focusing singularity. These exceptional cases will be considered in detail later on. For the present, it may simply be observed that Szekeres and Sbytov had omitted to include these cases. Another counterexample proposed by Stoyanov (1979) has proved to be incorrect as it does not satisfy the required boundary conditions (see Section 10.2). The same question applied to colliding electromagnetic waves is more complicated, and the answers are less conclusive. Generally, one may expect that, for a combination of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, a curvature singularity in region IV will usually occur. However, for purely electromagnetic waves it is less clear. In the first exact solution of this  type, given by Bell and Szekeres (1974), the singularity on the hypersurface  was shown to be only a coordinate singularity that could easily be removed by a coordinate transformation. This solution, which is conformally flat in the interaction region, will be described in Chapter 14 together with the full analysis of its singularity structure as given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). Other type D electrovac solutions have been obtained by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987a) and Papacostas and Xanthopoulos (1988). Further algebraically general solutions without curvature singularities can easily be constructed as will be indicated in Section 17.2. All these have quasiregular singularities that are interpreted as Cauchy horizons on the surface . These will be described later. We may conclude that, in all cases, the opposing waves mutually focus each other onto the hypersurface , on which the contraction of the waves is unbounded and the line element (6.20) is singular. Usually this will be a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, but a large class of  significant exceptions occurs. It is convenient to point out at this stage that, for colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves, two of the scalar polynomial invariants (Penrose and Rindler, 1986) are given by  (8.2) It follows from this that, in order to prove the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, it is sufficient merely to show that the component 2 is unbounded. In this case either I or J must be unbounded, and a curvature singularity occurs. It would, of course, be useful to have a number of general theorems that could be used to determine the singularity structure of particular classes of solutions. Apart from the earlier results of Szekeres (1972) and Sbytov (1976), the only general theorem to date is that of Tipler (1980). This is in fact a straightforward generalization of a theorem of Penrose (1965b)(see also Hawking and Ellis 1973, p.263). Quoting it directly: Theorem 8.1 (Tipler)Let (M, g) be a space-time with g at least C 2 , and suppose (M, g) has two globally defined commuting space-like Killing vector fields δ x and δ y which together generate plane symmetry. If,(1) the null convergence condition holds;(2) at least one of the six quantities  is non-zero at some point p in (M, g); and (3) through the point p there is a space-like partial Cauchy surface S, which is everywhere tangent to δ x and δ y , and S is non-compact in the space-like direction normal to δ x and δ y ; then (M, g) is null incomplete. This is an interesting theorem which seems to prove the existence of singularities for a large class of colliding plane waves. However, it requires that the metric be at least C 2 everywhere. It thus excludes situations involving impulsive gravitational waves. It does not apply therefore to the solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971), Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ), and the exceptional solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Nor does it apply to the colliding electromagnetic wave solution of Bell and Szekeres (1974) in which impulsive gravitational waves are generated by the collision. In addition, it proves only geodesic incompleteness and says nothing about curvature singularities. There exists, however, a very large class of exceptional solutions in which curvature singularities do not occur. For gravitational waves these include a degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987b) solution and the solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986b), which are respectively parts of the Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times. These have been described in more detail by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988), and will be described in Sections 10.5 and 13.3. They contain impulsive wave components, and therefore do not satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. In all these solutions, the singularity that occurs when  corresponds to a Cauchy horizon. This may be followed by either a space-like, or a time-like curvature singularity. The latter case would indicate that, if it were possible for real observers to pass through the horizon, then most would miss this singularity. A further class of exceptional vacuum solutions in which the curvature singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon has been obtained by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989). These solutions contain a subclass in which the approaching waves have smooth wave fronts and the metric is everywhere at least C 2 . They thus satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. They are geodesically incomplete, but the focusing hypersurface in this case is only a quasiregular singularity. These solutions thus illustrate the fact that a proof of null incompleteness does not necessarily imply the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. The Killing-Cauchy horizons that occur in these solutions have particular significance as the caustics formed by the mutual focusing of the opposing waves. They have also been further investigated by Yurtsever (1987), who has shown that they are unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the existence of space-like singularities is likely to be a generic feature of colliding plane wave solutions. This conclusion is also supported by the work of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987 b ), who have shown that the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of dust will change a horizon into a curvature singularity. In these exceptional cases, it is necessary for the approaching waves to take very specific forms in order to achieve the appropriate solution in region IV. The instability of the horizons in these solutions can easily be demonstrated in that they require very specific forms for the initial functions f(u) and g(v) . Any slight variation in these functions would change the Cauchy horizon into a curvature singularity. Most of the exceptional solutions that have been explicitly obtained are of algebraic type D, although the solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez are algebraically general. Perhaps it should also be remarked that algebraic type D solutions do not necessarily have horizons rather than singularities, a counterexample being one of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 b ) solutions. An alternative proof of Tipler's Theorem 8.1 has been given by Yurtsever (1988 b ). This emphasizes the role and necessity of the assumption of a strict plane symmetry. In this approach, the exceptional solutions that have Killing-Cauchy horizons in the interaction region do not satisfy the condition of strict plane symmetry as defined by Yurtsever. The structure of the singularity in the interaction region has been further analysed by Yurtsever (1988 c , 1989 a ), who has shown that the metric is asymptotic to an inhomogeneous Kasner solution as the singularity is approached. Initially (Yurtsever 1988 c ), he considered the case when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization and obtained explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data posed along the wave fronts of the approaching waves. From these expressions it is clear that, for specific choices of initial data, the curvature singularity formed by the interacting waves degenerates to a coordinate singularity. It can also be concluded that these Killing-Cauchy horizons are unstable against small but generic perturbations of the initial data and that, in a very precise sense, ‘generic’ initial data always produce all-embracing space-like curvature singularities. In the subsequent paper (Yurtsever, 1989 a ), he has shown that these same conclusions are also reached in the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is arbitrary. The Khan-Penrose solution The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) which has already been discussed in detail in Chapter 3, may now be reconsidered. It was shown there in particular, that the scalar invariants are unbounded on the hypersurface  in region IV, where  and . This clearly demonstrates the existence of a scalar curvature singularity on this hypersurface. In addition to this, there are apparent coordinate singularities  extending from it into regions II and III. The naive singularity structure of this solution is thus as represented in Figure 3.2. It is now necessary to consider in more detail the character of the apparent singularities in these initial regions II and III. As described in Section 3.3, if it is possible for real particles to pass through them, then it will be possible for those particles to subsequently look back and observe the naked singularity in region IV. If correct, this would provide a counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis. It is more likely, however, that these singularities will prove to be more than artificial coordinate singularities that particles can pass through. Figure 8.1 Sections through surfaces v = constant,y = 0, when u = 0, for three different (negative) values of v . Figure 8.2 Sections through the surface v = constant,y = 0, for three different values of u . This question has been discussed in an interesting paper by Matzner and Tipler (1984). Because of the obvious symmetry, we may concentrate on the singularity in region II. The first point to note is that, since the initial waves are impulsive, the interiors of both regions I and II are flat. For , curvature only occurs on the null boundary . The line elements for regions I and II are respectively  (8.3). (8.4) That these both describe flat space-time can be demonstrated by transforming (8.4) to the form (8.3) by putting . (8.5) It may be observed that the coordinate singularity  is effectively removed by this transformation, and there appears no a priori reason preventing the continuation of the coordinates  through it. Figure 8.3 Surfaces v = constant,y = 0,, for different (negative) values of v . Notice that the line  is common to all surfaces. Matzner and Tipler proceed to investigate the properties of the null hypersurfaces v = constant, working with the null Minkowski coordinates . Projections of these hypersurfaces are illustrated in Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. It can be seen that as  the curvature of these hypersurfaces diverges. It should also be noticed that the surfaces v = constant, considered as embedded in the three-space , consist of nested two-surfaces all having the line  in common. It is then possible show that the hypersurface  is not merely a coordinate singularity, but is actually a singularity of space-time in the sense that there does not exist a C 1 extension from region II to this surface. This can not be a curvature singularity, since the curvature tensor on it is zero. Matzner and Tipler accordingly describe it as a ‘fold singularity’. With this interpretation, the structure of the Khan-Penrose solution is thus as described in Figure 8.4. This result raises another problem. In the absence of the second wave, the entire space-time may be described by (8.3) for , and by (8.4) for , for all values of v . In this case, is merely a coordinate singularity. It has no physical significance and can be removed by a coordinate transformation. However, once the second wave is present, with wavefront , the above result states that  becomes a space-time singularity even for . This seems to violate our familiar concept of causality. The presence of the second wave seems to change the character of the prior singularity. Figure 8.4 The singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution. The resolution of this problem can be demonstrated using Figure 8.3. The family of surfaces for v = constant can be continued up to. However, there is a curvature singularity at . The final surface , which forms a bound for the prior surfaces, therefore contains a singularity on the line . In fact, this line  is actually common to the entire family of surfaces for which . Thus the line  must be considered as a singularity of space-time, which is identified with the point . In the Khan-Penrose solution, the singularities in regions II and III are topological singularities that are identified with the curvature singularity in region IV by the particular choice of coordinates. This point may be further clarified by considering a family of null geodesics that are initially parallel in region I, and enter region II. The null geodesic ,v = constant, starts in region I, passes through the gravitational wave and apparently ends at the  singularity. This may be contrasted, however, with a neighbouring geodesic which is given using  the null Minkowski coordinates defined by (8.5), by . This geodesic is given by . (8.6) From this it is clear that v increases indefinitely as  even for arbitrarily small values of ε. Thus, although the geodesic with   approaches the ‘fold singularity’ apparently at a finite distance from the curvature singularity in region IV, an arbitrarily close geodesic that is initially parallel to it in region II diverges from it and crosses into region IV before it reaches the hypersurface . This geodesic subsequently terminates in the curvature singularity in region IV. The projection of these two geodesics onto the plane  is illustrated in Figure 8.5. Figure 8.5 Projections of two neighbouring null geodesics onto the plane . The geodesics are parallel and arbitrarily close in region II, which is flat. It has thus been argued that the singularities  and  in regions II and III are essentially extensions of the singularity  in region IV. The apparent non-causality that appears in the introduction of these singularities is a consequence of the projection of the space-time onto the plane . Such a projection does not in general preserve causal relations. Although Figure 8.4 is very useful in formulating the colliding plane wave problem by dividing the space-time up into appropriate regions, in many ways it is misleading. In particular, it does not adequately describe the singularity structure of the solution, which appears to be non-causal. The problem arises from the attempt to represent space-time on a two-dimensional diagram. In many ways it would be preferable to attempt to picture a three-dimensional structure as in Figure 8.3. Such a picture has been drawn by Penrose, and was included in the paper of Matzner and Tipler (1984). This structure is illustrated in Figure 8.6 where the four regions are separately represented. Since curvature occurs only on the boundaries of regions I, II and III, the differently shaped boundaries of these regions have to be identified artificially. Region IV is curved and no adequate representation of it can be given. Using the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977), it can be seen that the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution is  clearly a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. Also the fold singularities in regions II and III that have a topological character, are quasiregular singularities since on them the curvature tensor is zero. Figure 8.6 A three-dimensional picture of the Khan-Penrose solution with . The interiors of regions I, II and III are flat, but the boundaries have intrinsically different geometry. Points on opposite sides of the wavefronts  and  must be identified. Region IV is curved, so its representation should be considered no more than schematic. The structure of other solutions In the previous section the singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution has been analysed in some detail. This has been possible because the interiors of regions I, II and III are all flat. In the general problem, however, it is only the background region I that is taken to be flat, and regions II and III, as well as IV, are curved. Consequently it is not possible in general to analyse the singularity structure in such detail. It is reasonable to assume, however, that most colliding plane wave solutions will have the same general singularity structure as that of the Khan Penrose solution. This in fact turns out to be the case, as will be shown here and in the following chapters. In almost all cases a curvature singularity develops in region IV on the hypersurface , although there is a large class of exceptional solutions in which the singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. These exceptional solutions provide the  only significant variation of the general singularity structure described above. The structure of these solutions will be described as they are derived in the following chapters. It has also been shown that, for all colliding plane wave solutions, coordinate singularities necessarily occur in regions II and III. For vacuum solutions, in these regions at most one component, either 4 or 0, of the curvature tensor is non-zero. Scalar polynomial curvature singularities therefore cannot occur. The coordinate singularities on the hypersurfaces  and  may thus either be quasiregular singularities if the curvature tensor on these surfaces is bounded, or they must be non-scalar curvature singularities if the curvature components become unbounded. It will now be argued that the topological ‘fold’ singularities of regions II and III in the Khan-Penrose solution, are also general features of all colliding plane wave solutions. Figure 8.7 The singularity structure for colliding sandwich gravitational waves. The shaded regions have non-zero curvature. If the approaching waves are ‘sandwich’ gravitational waves, then the regions behind the waves are flat. These flat regions must be described by metrics that are equivalent to those of the Khan-Penrose solution for regions II and III. After all, the impulsive waves considered by Khan and Penrose may be regarded as idealizations of such waves. In these cases similar ‘fold’ singularities will occur, as described in Figure 8.7. These singularities in regions II and III have been more thoroughly investigated by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). By concentrating on the Szekeres (1972) family of solutions, they have shown that these are quasiregular singularities in the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977) in the cases of impulsive and sandwich waves. In the alternative case of thick gravitational waves, they are non-scalar curvature singularities. In addition, by considering scalar wave perturbations in the impulsive  wave case, they have also shown that the quasiregular singularities are unstable and convert to scalar curvature singularities. To consider further the general character of these coordinate singularities in regions II and III we may concentrate on region II. The metric in this region may be taken to be of the form (6.20), but with the metric functions U ,V ,W and M all depending on u only. These functions may be obtained from those in region I simply by replacing g by ½, or v by 0. Considering the geodesics in this region, it is clear that there exist three conserved momentum components p x ,p y and p v besides the energy integral. These are given by  (8.7) where ε may be taken to be 0 on null geodesics and 1 on time-like geodesics. Using (8.7), we obtain the equation  (8.8) Expressions for U and M in region II can be obtained from (7.2) and (7.8) in the form  (8.9) With these,(8.8) may be integrated to give  (8.10) It may immediately be seen from this that no time-like or null geodesics with either p x or p y non-zero can avoid crossing the surface  into  region IV before reaching the surface on which . The only exception occurs when . This clearly manifests the character of the fold singularity as described in the previous section. In colliding plane wave problems, what is essentially a coordinate singularity for a single wave is transformed into a fold singularity prior to the collision by the presence of curvature singularities at the points  and . Generally these are associated with a space-like singularity on , but as described above, there are exceptional cases in which this singularity is replaced by a horizon. However, even in these cases, it is found that there exist at least distribution valued singularities just at these points. From this, it may be argued that the presence of fold singularities in regions II and III appears to be a general feature of colliding plane wave problems. It has thus been argued that the general structure of all colliding plane wave solutions is as illustrated in Figure 8.6 with  with the possible exception that, for some solutions, the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. Figure 8.8 The general structure of colliding plane wave solutions related to the initial hypersurface on which initial Cauchy data is set. It is also appropriate to attempt to relate this general singularity structure to some initial hypersurface on which the initial Cauchy data for the colliding wave problem is specified. To do this it is necessary to incorporate the properties of plane waves that have been described in Section 4.4 and illustrated in Figure 4.1. In particular, it must be noted that no global space-like hypersurface exists on which initial Cauchy data for the problem can be set. The existence of the topological ‘fold’ singularities in regions II and III implies bounds for the initial Cauchy  hypersurface in both of the directions from which the waves emerge. This property is illustrated in Figure 8.8. It can immediately be deduced from Figure 8.8 that, for solutions in which the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon, any possible extension through this horizon must be non-unique. Any extended space-time beyond this singularity will depend on extra initial data in addition to that specified on the initial Cauchy hypersurface for the colliding wave problem. The above arguments lead to the conclusion that the usual initial data for colliding plane waves leads to a unique solution only up to the topological singularities  and  in regions II and III, and to the ‘focusing’ singularity  in the interaction region. This focusing singularity is normally a curvature singularity, but this may be replaced by a Cauchy horizon. In this case, any future extension through the horizon is non-unique."
ACA ACA-B2K-004 -0.36 "ERNST EQUATION FOR COLLIDING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES The solutions being considered here for colliding plane waves all have a pair of commuting Killing vectors that are assumed to exist globally. It may therefore be expected that the solutions obtained may be related to known cylindrically symmetric solutions, or to stationary axisymmetric solutions, which similarly have a pair of Killing vectors. Such a relation was first pointed out by Kinnersley (1975), and by Fisher (1980). The exact relation between these solutions has been established more recently by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), and Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1985 a ), and exploited by these authors and their colleagues. In this chapter we will present an analysis of the colliding wave problem using a method that has become familiar in the study of stationary axisymmetric space-times. In this case the field is described in terms of a complex potential function that is referred to as the Ernst potential (see Ernst 1968 a ). This approach leads directly to various methods for generating further exact solutions. A derivation of the Ernst equation First it may be recalled that, of the vacuum field equations (6.22a-f) considered in previous chapters,(6.22a) may immediately be integrated to give ,(11.1) and (6.22d, e) are integrability conditions for the remaining equations. Attention is thus focused on these main equations for the metric functions  and . It is now appropriate to consider a different combination of these functions, by putting  (11.2) or, inversely . (11.3) This modifies the form of the line element (6.20), which now becomes . (11.4) It is also convenient to introduce the complex function . (11.5) With this, the line element (11.4) can be written in the form  (11.6) and the two main equations (6.22d, e) can be written as the single complex equation  (11.7) It may be seen that this is in fact Ernst's equation, which can be written in the coordinate-invariant form  (11.8) where  is the square of the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field which, in this case, is a function of the two (null) coordinates only. Similarly, v2 is the 3+1-dimensional Laplacian operator (or the generalized d'Alembertian) given by . (11.9) Using the above notation, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor given by (6.23) can be written as  (11 10) When considering Ernst's equation, it is frequently found to be useful also to introduce an associated function Ε, defined by  (11.11) With this, the line element (11.4) or (11.6) can be written in the alternative form  (11.12) and the main equations (6.22d, e), or alternatively (11.7), become . (11.13) This is the alternative form of the Ernst equation and may be rewritten in the coordinate-invariant form . (11.14) Using this function, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor (11.10) can be written as  (11.1) The problem now involves finding appropriate solutions of (11.7) or (11.13). These equations, however, contain the derivatives of U , and hence they depend on the arbitrary functions f(u) and g(v) that are specified by the incoming waves. This apparently explicit dependence on initial conditions may in fact be removed by adapting the coordinate system of Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Here we again use (10.9–12) and put  (11.16) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting . (11.17) In this coordinate system, equation (11.7) takes the more familiar explicit form of Ernst's equation:(11.18) and (11.13) similarly becomes  (11.19) The intermediate steps in the derivation of these equations may be deduced from (16.6) and (16.11). See also (12.30–31). It may be noticed that, in this case, the solution of these equations immediately determines some of the metric functions. This is in marked contrast to their application in stationary axisymmetric space-times, where the Ernst equation only determines potentials for the fields. The original metric functions, as considered in previous chapters, are now given by  (11.20) Boundary conditions When looking for solutions of the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetric space-times, it is appropriate to require that solutions be asymptotically flat. However, for colliding plane waves very different boundary conditions apply. For colliding plane waves it is necessary to choose Z or Ε, and hence V and W , such that the solution of (6.22b, c, f) for M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. For vacuum solutions, it is appropriate to use (7.8) and equations (7.9) may then be written in the form . To ensure that the boundary conditions are satisfied, it is then essential that the solution of these equations should include the necessary components (7.10). In this approach, solutions in the interaction region for  or  are related to the functions  and , and hence S may be obtained as a function of f and g . The boundary conditions described in Chapter 7 may then be considered to place restrictions on the structure of these functions, which characterize the approaching waves. In practice, these boundary conditions are difficult to apply, basically because the condition that M be continuous is only indirectly applied to the functions V and W , or Z , or E , that feature in the main equations. It is therefore often convenient to apply the boundary condition in the form (7.15) or (7.16). Writing , this becomes  This form is particularly convenient when , which occurs when impulsive waves are present. The boundary conditions in this limited case only, have been discussed by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ). In terms of the functions f and g , the conditions (11.22) become  where k 1 and k 2 must satisfy the inequalities (7.13). Alternatively, writing , the boundary conditions require that   which, in terms of the functions f and g become  (11.26) Finally, it is convenient to express the boundary conditions in terms of the variables t and z . These become, for ,(11.27) where k 1 and k 2 satisfy (7.13). Colinear solutions In the next chapter, the approach described above will be used to derive new solutions for colliding gravitational waves whose polarization vectors are not aligned. Such solutions essentially have W non-zero, and hence Z and Ε are complex. However, before moving on to consider such cases, it is appropriate first to review the colinear solutions described in previous chapters. These solutions have Z and Ε real. (i)The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971), discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 8.2, which describes the collision of aligned impulsive gravitational waves, is given by . (11.28) In this case  and . It may be observed that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times,(11.28) is the Ernst potential which leads to the Schwarzschild solution. (ii)The Szekeres (1972) class of solutions, described in Chapter 9, is given by . (11.29) In this case  and , with  for  and . (iii)The ‘solution’ of Stoyanov (1979) given by (10.24) uses . (11.30) In Section 10.2 it has been argued that this solution must be considered to be unphysical on its own, but it may be included as a factor in more general solutions. It does not satisfy the boundary conditions (11.26). (iv)The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 a ) and Griffiths (1987), which is described in Section 10.3, is characterized by  where  (11.31) In this case  and , where  and .

It is not difficult to see how further solutions of this type can be generated."
ACA ACA-B2K-007 -0.25 "THE INITIAL-VALUE PROBLEM The approach to finding exact solutions that has been taken so far has involved initially solving the field equations in the interaction region IV and then investigating the conditions under which these solutions can be considered as the result of collisions of plane waves. In this way, resulting solutions are found first and the initial conditions are obtained subsequently. In this chapter it is appropriate to return to the original problem of specifying the initial data and then attempting to find the solution that determines the subsequent development. The initial data The problem that is under consideration is the collision of two plane waves in a flat background. It is assumed that the two approaching waves are both known, and it is required to find the exact solution which describes the interaction following the collision. This problem has been formulated in earlier chapters. It has been found convenient to divide space-time into the four regions as illustrated in Figure 3.1. It has also been demonstrated that the metric in the interaction region IV may be taken in the form of the Szekeres line element (6.20) which involves the four functions ,, and  satisfying equations (6.22). One of these equations can be integrated to give . (14.1) In this approach, it is assumed that the initial conditions are determined by the functions  and  which represents the wave in region II as it reaches the boundary , and by  which represents the wave in region III as it reaches the boundary . This is now a typical case of the characteristic initial-value problem. In practice, however, things are a little more complicated since it is normal to make use of the transformation (6.7) to put  in these initial regions. In this case the approaching waves are each described by three functions either of u or of v satisfying a single equation which is either (6.22c) or (6.22b). The difficulty arises because, as described in previous chapters, it is convenient to use f and g , or transformations of them, as coordinates in  the interaction region. Accordingly, it is therefore more convenient to use the transformation (6.7) in the initial regions to put  (14.2) where the constants  and  are essential in order to retain the continuity properties of the functions f and g across the boundaries  and . These constants feature prominently in the junction conditions as described in Section 7.2. They are determined by the character of the wavefronts of the approaching waves. In this case, the data specifying the initial waves is now given by  on , and by  on . In addition, since the function M is essentially determined up to a removable constant for any V and W by equations (6.22b, c), the initial data is effectively described by specifying only the metric functions V and W on the boundaries  and . It is also appropriate to re-express these as functions of f and g . The remaining problem is now to integrate the main field equations to determine the functions V and W in the interaction region subject to their specification on the initial null boundaries. The colinear case For the case when the approaching waves have aligned linear polarization it is possible to put  everywhere, and the main field equation for V may be expressed in terms of different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.11),(10.60) or (10.71). At this point we may take f and g as coordinates and consider the equation in the form (10.2) which may be rewritten as . (14.3) This equation must now be solved for  with initial data defining the approaching waves given by  and . It is also possible to scale the approaching waves such that at the point of collision , and . Equation (14.3) is an Euler-Poisson Darboux equation whose solution may be expressed as a line integral. As originally pointed out in this context by Szekeres (1972) and later repeated by Yurtsever (1988 c ), since (14.3) is a linear hyperbolic equation, it may also be solved explicitly using Riemann's method. According to this method, we consider the adjoint equation  (14,4) where R is a Riemann-Green function satisfying the boundary conditions . (14.5) Figure 14.1 The interaction region IV is represented in f ,g coordinates by the region inside the triangle shown. The sides  and  are the II-IV and III-IV boundaries respectively, and the focusing singularity occurs on the line . The solution for  may be obtained at any point P by integrating round the rectangle PNML. By using Green's theorem the integral of  over the rectangle PNML indicated in Figure 14.1 can be related to its line integral around the boundary. In this way it can be shown that, for any arbitrary point  within the interaction region, the function V is given by  (14.6) provided that R satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) and that . A specific Riemann Green function which satisfies (14.4) and (14.5) is given by  (14.7) where  is the Legendre function of order -½. By substituting this and the initial expressions for V on the boundaries ML and MN into (14.6), an explicit integral for V in the interaction region is obtained. This approach of using Riemann's method has been generalized by Xanthopoulos (1986) to include the collision of null fluids coupled with plane gravitational waves. This particular situation will be discussed later in Section 20.2. At this point, we may simply note that the method involved is essentially the same. Although the method described above does give an explicit integral expression for V , in practice it is extremely difficult to evaluate this integral for arbitrary initial data. Thus, it does not really provide a viable method for generating analytic solutions for any given analytic description of the approaching waves. Another problem with the method of Riemann is that it is not practically possible to generalize it to the case for non-colinear collisions. The method only applies to linear hyperbolic equations and, if the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned, the field equations describing the resulting interaction are non-linear. In view of this, Hauser and Ernst (1989 a , b, 1990) have developed an alternative method which can be generalized to the non-colinear situation. The method employed by Hauser and Ernst (1989 a ) is first to find a one-parameter family of basic solutions by means of a suitable separation of variables and then to express the  final solution as a linear super-position of these basic solutions. In fact their approach is based on the solution (10.8), which may be re-expressed in the form  (14.8) for suitable functions  and  which must depend on the initial data. An interesting feature of the method is that the functions  and  are obtained in terms of the prescribed initial data by solving generalized versions of Abel's integral equation for the tautochrone problem of classical particle mechanics. Generalized versions of Abel's integral equation are required because f' (u)and g' (v)are zero on the boundaries  and  respectively. Full details of the method have been described by Hauser and Ernst (1989 a ). However, the techniques are still difficult to use in practice for arbitrary initial data. Hauser and Ernst (1989 b ) have also reformulated the initial-value problem for the colinear case as a Hilbert problem in a complex plane in two different ways. They have presented solutions of both forms of the Hilbert problem and shown that each of these agrees with the solution that is obtained by the method referred to above (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 a ). The non-colinear case Hauser and Ernst (1989 a , b, 1990) have developed the techniques mentioned at the end of the previous section to deal specifically with the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned. The initial data have already been described in Section 14.1. It was also pointed out that, for the colinear case, it was convenient to rescale the approaching waves such that at the point of collision. For the non-colinear case, Hauser and Ernst have found it convenient to work with the complex function Z defined by (11.5) and to use the transformation (12.20) which consists of a rotation and rescaling to put  at the point of collision when  and . For the colinear case the main field equation (14.3) is linear. However, for the non-colinear case this is replaced by two non-linear equations, or by the complex Ernst equation. The non-linearity of this equation introduces considerable difficulty into any attempt at solving the general problem. Hauser and Ernst (1990) have developed a method for considering the initial-value problem for general colliding plane gravitational waves. They have achieved this by replacing the usual initial-value problem in terms of the Ernst equation by an equivalent 2 × 2 matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem in the complex plane. In the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is colinear, this approach reduces to the relatively simple one-dimensional Hilbert problem that was previously considered (Hauser and Ernst, 1989 b ). A detailed description of the method developed, however, is beyond the scope of this book and interested readers are directed to the original papers. In spite of these advances, there is strong evidence that the general solution of the initial-value problem for the non-colinear case is not expressible in a finite closed form. In addition, practical methods for solving the matrix homogeneous Hilbert problem for particular non-colinear cases still need to be developed. Clearly this is an area where considerable further work is required."
ACA ACA-CRS-001 -0.39 "Integrating services for the under fives Attempting to integrate under fives Policy in Islington, 1983–8 Margaret Boushel, Clare Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach During the 1980s Margaret Boushel, Claire Debenham, Lisa Dresner and Anna Gorbach worked in the London borough of Islington within social services for pre-school children. This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered. The first section provides an overview of provision and services in 1983. The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy. The third section looks at the faltering progress towards integrated services. The fourth section examines the formidable barriers that were posed by reorganisation of social services, local authority cuts and the demise of the Inner London Education Authority. The chapter concludes with a mixture of resignation and determination. BACKGROUND: UNDER-FIVES SERVICES IN ISLINGTON, 1983 Islington is a multi-ethnic, inner city London borough with a child population of 29,000. In 1982, 44 per cent of under fives in Islington had the use of an under-fives facility, 29 per cent on a full-time and 15 per cent on a part-time basis. Between 1982 and 1988 provision gradually increased, so that by 1988 there were 12 children's day centres, about 70 playgroups and 350 assisted child-minding places funded partially or totally by the Social Services Department, and 1,075 full-time and 824 part-time places in nursery schools funded by the Inner London Education Authority. The Beacon Nursery, a local Mencap project, offered care five days per week to children over one year of age categorised as having severe learning difficulties. Unlike council day centres, playgroups or community nurseries, the Beacon Nursery was free. Children were collected from home by special bus and places were available on demand. The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs. By 1983 it had half that number on roll. Since 1983 numbers at the Beacon continued to fall as it was increasingly seen as a resource for children with severe and multiple disabilities. In addition the Elfreda Rathbone  organisation, a voluntary organisation helping people with learning disabilities, ran a free day nursery in the borough for a small number of children with learning difficulties. Some integrated services emerged in the early 1980s — one playscheme was developed through a parent's initiative, and an integrated adventure playground was established by a voluntary organisation. Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup. In addition to its mainstream schools, the borough included five special schools providing primary and secondary education to children with special needs from Islington and neighbouring boroughs — one for children with moderate learning difficulties, one for children with severe learning difficulties, one for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, one for autistic children, and one for children with physical disabilities. In 1983 three of these offered nursery places to children from the age of 2. The children using all of these services came from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, though rarely was this actively and positively reflected in the type of care provided or the ethnic background of their carers. Residential units By 1983 residential services were designed with ‘care in the community’ in mind, but most were based in specialist settings. For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite ‘round the clock’ care. Parents had fought for this as a local resource to prevent the need for children to be placed in long-stay placements far from home. By 1988 Field End had been joined by another specialist children's respite care unit at Leigh Road. The Social Services Department also provided thirteen short-term and long-term residential units for children in care (by 1988 their number had been reduced to eleven), none with wheelchair access and only one with any experience of caring for children with learning difficulties. The Community Health Team The Community Health Team had major responsibility for assessing children and recommending provision. It included physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists, doctors, psychologists and a specialist health visitor. They were joined in the network by specialist teachers, funded by the ILEA and based in the special schools, who visited children at home before they were due to start school. This group of people met on a regular basis to coordinate services and discuss professional issues. Discussion of services to individual children also took place. This included deciding between day care or school, and parents' attitudes  to different options. Often a member of the group was delegated to advise parents on a course of action. The Community Health Team aim was to ensure a place of treatment for children from the earliest possible age, to enable them to develop to their fullest potential. They were, however, an all-White group, operating without directly involving parents and were generally committed to specialist care in the community. They gave support to the Beacon and Elfreda Rathbone nurseries and most members saw these settings as the best places to ‘treat’ children. Because of their early contact with parents they often had considerable influence in steering parents towards specialist provision. The Special Services Team In the early 1980s social workers were funded jointly by the ILEA and Islington Social Services Department to work with children attending two special schools and two specialist units for ‘partially hearing’ children. These social workers were based in the borough's Special Services Team. They all worked with some under fives attending the schools they covered. They were aware of a number of pre-school children who did not have adequate access to resources or support when parents and professionals were becoming aware of the possible extent and implications of the disability. When a vacancy arose within this group of social workers in 1983 it was decided to appoint someone specialising in work with under fives with special needs. This might have had the effect of drawing families into the specialist system at an earlier stage. Instead, for a number of reasons, it proved to be a key step in the development of the debate about integration in Islington. First, the post was not attached to any specialist institution. There was an expectation but not a contractual obligation that the postholder would work closely with the Beacon Nursery. Second, the worker had an alternative peer group of under-fives workers who were key figures in controlling access to all other under-fives facilities. Third, the worker was committed to the idea that treatment of a medical or disabling condition should not take precedence over the child's social, emotional and cultural needs. There was now a new worker in the network who also made an early relationship with families but who could present a broader choice of day care to parents. ATTEMPTING AN INTEGRATION POLICY The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort. This led to the initiation of an under-fives review. The review team, set up under the auspices of the Social Services Committee, included councillors, senior departmental management and representatives of the children's day centre organisers and under-fives social workers in its membership. It proposed a network of  under-fives centres throughout the borough — an idea which the under-fives workers had been anxious to promote for some time. Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents. The review had made no mention of children with special needs. The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children. They interviewed parents, specialist professionals and mainstream day-care workers and they designed a questionnaire which was completed by workers in a large proportion of mainstream council services and voluntary organisations, as well as by some child-minders. Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice. Parents wanted to be part of the decision-making and did not feel that they were. Many commented on lack of information about the range of facilities on offer. One Afro-Caribbean woman described how she felt that she was never given a choice of provision for her son, and objected to being told he should be in a specialist nursery for his own good. She fought hard to get him a part-time playgroup place in the group his older brother attended. Because the group had known her and her children for some time they agreed to ‘have a go’ and the placement went ahead. She commented: I had to fight every step of the way for this. No one told me about it, and no one wanted him to have it. I knew it was right for him — this is where he learnt to join in and be like other children. It doesn't matter that he's not like them. I know what is right for my child, but I'm not supposed to say. Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist ‘therapy’ time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way. Some parents were very worried that more integrated settings would lead to lack of attention for children with special needs. Definitions of ‘special needs’ varied widely in the questionnaire responses — some defining it as children with disabilities, some including children with behavioural and emotional problems and some including children whose first language was not English. This made the survey difficult to interpret. The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome. These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee. The conference: ‘A place for all our children' As a result of this work the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives (CCUF), an umbrella organisation of statutory and voluntary sector groups and individuals providing a service to under fives, decided to organise a conference to look at the issues of integration of special needs children within mainstream provision. Prior to the conference various groups met to produce short contributions to the debate. These included parents, under-fives workers, specialist workers, children's day centre organisers and playgroups organisers. Each of these groups came up with a list of proposals which were sent to everyone attending. About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985. Workshops facilitated by the speakers and the conference organising group examined integration policies, overcoming practical problems for children in integrated provision and available sources of information. The conference made the following recommendations: 1 For a formal, universal information system, covering local and specialist resources. 2 For children's needs to be considered with parents and their wishes acknowledged and recognised. 3 For employment of extra staff where needed, and employment of peripatetic special needs workers. 4 For availability of money for equipment, toys and adaptations. 5 For enhanced payments to child-minders caring for children with special needs. 6 For priority status for children with special needs in order to facilitate access to ordinary provision. 7 For training facilities for staff in ordinary provision, specialist provision and child-minders. 8 For greater communication and sharing of resources between ordinary and specialist provision. 9 For therapeutic and professional staff to reflect the cultural backgrounds of the children, and that for all children, including those with special needs, their day-care environment and activities to express a consciousness of the multicultural society in Islington. It was made clear that all of the above areas needed funding from health, education and social services before they could be implemented. Finally, it was felt that unless the attitudes of advisers and information-givers became more positive towards integration, none of the recommendations could be effective. The Social Services Department had responsibility for carrying out many of the recommendations of the conference. The message came loud and clear from all quarters that until council services were more welcoming to children with special needs, parents would continue to choose specialist provision out of caution. Unfortunately, at this point neither senior management staff in the Social  Services Department nor the local councillors involved in the conference presented the Conference Report to the Social Services Committee for ratification as council policy. The core group who organised the conference were basic grade workers in the department who did not know the processes by which policy change is effected. As a result there was no informed discussion within the department or at the Social Services Committee about resource issues and the status of the recommendations remained vague. The sub-committee In the absence of official support we established a Special Needs Sub-committee of the Coordinating Committee for Under Fives to further the conference recommendations and the proposals of The Fish Report (ILEA 1985) on special education provision within ILEA, which favoured integration. The group eventually included representatives from health, education and social services with a small representation of parents and voluntary groups. Battles were waged in meetings of the sub-committee and the level of organisational resistance to change became clear. Many community health workers attended and expressed their scepticism about moves to greater integration. They said children needed trained professionals to care for them and carry out their treatment programmes. They also felt that specialist workers could pass on skills and ideas to others, but it would take time. If children were integrated, workers would have to travel to many different centres and spend time training carers. Their aim was care in the community, but not anywhere in the community! Interestingly, few of the workers at the Beacon or Elfreda Rathbone had ‘specialist’ training, but they had experience of specialist segregated provision and an approach which focused on the ‘special needs’of a child rather than on ‘total needs’. THE PROGRESS OF INTEGRATION Despite professional and organisational inertia and resistance, some things did happen! There were a number of areas where greater willingness was apparent to include children with special needs and make services more locally responsive. Day-care provision Successful integrated day-care placements for under fives were negotiated by the specialist social worker and the parents, or sometimes the parents alone or the parents with another committed individual. It involved hard work and long discussions, dealing with fears, anxieties and practical problems, which needed to continue long after the child had been placed. Even when day centres or playgroups were willing they were often still very nervous, and afraid of making mistakes. This could lead to over-protectiveness and care had to be taken to ensure that a child was involved in all the group's activities. Playgroups Following the CCUF conference playgroups responded most rapidly. To some degree they had already been catering for children with special needs. Because of their small size and their close connections with local parents, playgroups were responsive and flexible in their way of working. Despite unsuitable premises, lack of funding and a dearth of promised support from the council, many groups tried hard to accommodate children's needs. Their staff were generally willing to ‘have a go’, and with some information and support went a long way in challenging their own attitudes and those of other children and parents. Some children moved out of specialist provision into playgroups (full or part time) and made considerable strides in social relationships, becoming part of a community and friendship network which continued into their schooldays, whether or not they went to special school at 5 years. Day centres Some individual placements were being made in children's day centres. Although it was policy for all children to be welcome in council provision, in reality this was highly variable. Access was dependent on parents receiving the information and encouragement to apply, experiencing the organiser and staff of the centre as welcoming and willing to learn about and accommodate the child's needs. They had to be willing, too, to wait for a place to become available. Some extremely successful placements have been made in council day centres. Sometimes centres were able to relieve any additional pressure on staff by allocating the equivalent of two places to one child. In some cases extra support has been unnecessary. Child-minding A few children were also placed with child-minders, who were awarded additional payments by the council if the child required sufficient extra attention that s/he needed to take up more than one place. This led to battles with senior management who questioned the status of the policy decision to implement the new system. The specialist nursery The Beacon Nursery was taken over by the council, as requested by Mencap. This could have provided opportunities for structural change and review. These never took place. Senior management failed to take a lead in clarifying the role of the Beacon in the department's services to under fives. What did happen was that the nursery staff felt themselves to be part of a wider childcare system and took advantage of formal and informal links. There was exchange of information and  sometimes of staff and children. The nursery was also influenced by the council's equal opportunities policies — for example, staff took part in a conference considering anti-racist strategies with under fives. A consideration of these ideas fostered the recognition that the children had social, racial and cultural identities as well as disabilities. As a result of more able children taking up integrated placements or moving into school, the Beacon was now catering for a very small number of multiply disabled children, who were highly segregated as a result. Residential provision As a result of two consultation days held to examine possibilities for greater integration in residential provision for children and young people with special needs, a series of recommendations were made to and accepted by the Social Services Committee in January 1987. These included: developing a respite care service, improving mobility access in children's residential units, providing disability awareness training, developing a coordinated assessment and review system for all children arid developing services for young adults. Most of these recommendations affected services for under fives. Respite care The Family Care Scheme, which provided care for children in their own homes was from its inception open to children with disabilities and their families. Again this was possible, at least in part, because the scheme coordinator was personally committed to such provision. Following the consultation days a pilot respite care scheme was begun offering twenty days respite care per year to ten families, to be planned at times and in ways to suit the families concerned. Priority is being given to children with physical disabilities for whom no other respite care service exists in the borough. Access At the time of the consultation exercise no children's home in the borough had mobility access. Since then plans were drawn up to make one short-term unit and one longer-term unit accessible. On completion, the use of day and residential facilities, including a family flat, were to be available to parents and children with physical disabilities or sensory impairments. Disability awareness A small group of specialist and non-specialist staff and a couple of parents of children with special needs together devised a two-day training course on disability awareness, directed in the first instance at staff working with young children. The course included information and discussions about discrimination, legal issues, support services, parents' views and shared care. Parents, staff with disabilities, and specialist and non-specialist staff from the department and from local voluntary organisations were involved in running the course. It was attended by workers with under fives, children's residential staff and Family Care Scheme staff and found very useful. Staff were particularly positive about the contributions from parents, the information on the support available from local specialist workers, and the practical information on such things as lifting techniques, epileptic attacks, which was provided. BARRIERS IN THE SYSTEM From 1985 onwards a number of additional formidable barriers to progress towards a coherent, integrated under-fives policy began to emerge. Reorganising social services After 1985 the Social Services Department underwent fundamental structural change as its ten area teams, including under-fives workers, were redistributed to twenty-four Neighbourhood Offices as part of the council's decentralisation policy. Field, day and residential services changed to an integrated line management structure, so that all day and residential services were managed through the Neighbourhood Office in which they were situated. The Department was reorganised into five geographical districts, each managed by an assistant director who also had a responsibility for particular service areas. The way these responsibilities were divided presented particular difficulties in work on integration. Three different assistant directors had responsibilities relating to children with disabilities — one for under fives, another for older children and their families, and a third for adults with physical and learning disabilities! Each Neighbourhood Office was allocated a half-time under-fives worker post, despite a large increase in workload. It was almost inevitable that this would have a negative effect on any innovative work. The issue of integration began to lose its visibility. Attitudes, especially among new senior staff, were often at variance with the council's stated philosophy towards under fives generally and towards integration in particular. The cuts As a result of central government policies, Islington social services suffered 8 per cent cuts in 1987/8 and all departments were asked to produce proposals for cuts of up to a further 25 per cent which they might have to achieve over the next two years. Cuts of that level would decimate the existing service and make it almost impossible for underdeveloped areas of the service such as facilities for children with physical disabilities, imaginative respite, and family-based care schemes and improved under-fives facilities to be developed. Under-fives services were not identified as a priority. Instead, it proposed that the Beacon and six other children's day centres be closed over the next two years, with an increase in supported child-minding placements to compensate, in part, for this loss. The care provided by the Beacon was to transfer to special units in the remaining children's day centres. It is ironic that radical proposals for the integration of the Beacon, resisted by some specialist staff at all levels in the past, were now to be enforced by the cuts exercise. The danger was that the department would end up with the worst of both worlds — an integrated service provided in a hastily planned way, foisted on staff unprepared for the challenge and lacking the positive commitment and support that is so necessary from specialist staff and their managers. The abolition of the ILEA Legislation in 1988 brought with it the central government decision to abolish the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) by 1990, despite the opposition of 93 per cent of parents in Inner London. For Islington this meant that in addition to taking over the day-to-day running and management of the pre-school, school and adult educational facilities in its area, the borough had to provide resources in areas previously funded by ILEA, London-wide. In particular these London-wide resources have been used to provide facilities for children with special needs in specialist day and boarding schools. The borough brought in a group of consultants to produce topic papers on twelve of the major areas affected by abolition. These included issues of equality, special needs and services for under fives. Before the decision on its abolition, the ILEA had already virtually abandoned the recommendations of The Fish Report, although some of the topic papers continued to support the idea of integration in general, unspecified ways. The paper on Special Needs however, written by a former director of the local ILEA division, raised the integration principle as one which was again open for discussion and decision. The document stated that the arguments for and against would be set out in some detail. The only argument stated in its favour, however, was to refer to The Fish Report ideas on equality. The author (Roy price) then went on to state that integration may not be ‘practicable’; and that ‘segregation is a way to later integration’. He gave the example of a two-year Community Skills course in a local college that drew its recruits from the special schools. He also argued that the Campaign for Choice in Education advocated specialism. It so happened that a local head of a special school was very involved in this campaign. Finally, he suggested that opportunities for increased parent/governor control and ‘opting-out’ under the Education Reform Act might mean that schools would become more competitive and less likely to want to pursue integration. Most people in Islington, councillors included, were unlikely to have read The Fish Report or to be aware of the arguments put forward in it. In such a context Roy Price's description of the issues involved struck us as extremely lopsided. The abolition of the ILEA also had a direct impact in the under-fives field. The under-fives topic paper suggested that all group provision for under fives should be organised through the new borough Education Department. This would lead to the transfer of children's day centres from social work to education and their possible future demise. It contained a plan to halve the number of places in children's day centres from 1989. The number of subsidised child-minding places was to be increased, but this would not provide the group experience that is such a valuable aspect of day centre provision. Neither would it allow for flexible staff allocation to meet the needs of children with particular disabilities. It was unclear where responsibility for child-minders, registration of playgroups, etc. would rest in the new organisation, but it was possible that the new provisions in the Children Bill going through parliament would allow for those services to be provided through education departments. Despite the difficulties in changing attitudes outlined in this chapter, there is little doubt that workers in mainstream social services provision were more prepared to accept the idea and practical implications of integration provision than those in mainstream education. In such a situation the future for integration looked bleak. The transfer of ILEA responsibilities to the council meant that future decisions around integration and children would be mainly the brief of the new Education Committee. This committee was likely to be more responsive to lobbying and pressure from parents of children already in ‘mainstream’ schools and from the huge workforce in mainstream and specialist education. Such a powerbase is potentially much more difficult to change in the interests of a small discriminated-against group. The cuts and internal reorganisation in the ILEA also resulted in a total turn-about on decisions concerning the specialist social worker post. When the postholder left in December 1987, the post was redesignated to a special school. Once again all social workers in the Special Services Team were to be attached to special schools with under fives inevitably drawn into the specialist system again. Shortly after this regressive move the post was cut completely. CONCLUDING REMARKS In 1988, integrated placements are still being achieved ‘against the tide’. There was still a lack of commitment to integration from social services, health and education, even though individuals within those services were becoming increasingly willing to help. Parents were still placed under enormous pressure to choose specialist resources ‘in the interests of the child’: integrated placements were often presented as chiefly fulfilling a selfish need of the parents to deny their child's special needs. A coordinated assessment and review system for all children had proved difficult to develop. Children with disabilities and their parents tend to have most contact with specialist health, education and social services during the child's  early years. Until the three agencies actively involve parents and staff from non-specialist areas in their assessment and review procedures and give equal weight to the promotion and consideration of integrated placements, such placements will remain a rarity. Staff and parents need to be strongly motivated to seek an integrated placement in a children's day centre or nursery school. The local specialist nursery for children with learning difficulties had a much shorter waiting list and took children from the age of 2. Within social services, respite care for children with learning difficulties was provided by the local specialist units. It demanded interest and commitment on the part of the workers to try and set up respite fostering or other more integrated arrangements as an alternative. Placements are most successful when the policy-makers and professionals involved have a positive attitude to exploring integrated care and are willing to support the care-givers and the parents. Too often, unnecessary organisational problems undermine the process. At the end of 1987, three years after the conference ‘A place For All Our Children’, one council day centre offered a place to a child with a ‘learning difficulty’. Some days later some staff raised objections at a staff meeting and the offer was withdrawn. Because council officers still fail to enforce council policy and because individuals involved in management are still unwilling to grasp the nettle and take up the argument the child lost the place. Cost is not everything. It is very obvious from our experience that attitude is at least as crucial as cost, and arguments around cost sometimes act as a smoke-screen for negative attitudes. It is now more important than ever, as we endure and try to resist the demolition of the Welfare State, that children with special needs and their families do not suffer a disproportionate reduction in services. The shift in policy, attitudes and provision begun in the moves towards integration must a continued. Community play Veronica Hanson In this article, Veronica Hanson describes a scheme that was set up by the Welsh Pre-school Playgroups Association (PPA) to encourage the integration into local playgroups of children who experience difficulties in learning. There is national funding for the scheme. Veronica Hanson describes the stages that the PPA proposal had to go through to be accepted by the Welsh Office and she goes on to describe how the county schemes are supported, managed and run now that they are in operation. INTRODUCTION Members of the Pre-School playgroups Association (PPA) in Wales (which became in independent association in 1987) are so convinced of each family's right to choice of provision for their children that they have taken positive steps to make this possible. County ‘referral schemes’ have been established to ease the integration of children with special needs into the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Once a family contacts or is referred to the referral scheme coordinator every assistance is given to that family to link into their local community group to ensure that the group is physically suitable and that any special assistance needed to enable the child to attend the group and enjoy its activities is provided. Playgroups and mother and toddler groups offer safe and stimulating play opportunities for the children and friendship for mother and child. Playgroups are set up and managed by parent members of the group, usually through a committee and employing a playgroup leader. The groups take place in a church or chapel hall or other community building and are supported by PPA voluntary area organisers and a network of volunteers at branch, county and Wales level. FINDING THEIR WAY Children with special needs have long been welcomed into playgroups or mother and toddler groups but members have tended to worry on two counts — first, that only a minority of families with children with special needs were finding their  way to playgroup, and second that the playgroup was not fully able to meet the children's needs. Two counties, Clwyd and South Glamorgan, took the lead and the nucleus of a PPA special needs referral scheme was established in each county in the early 1980s. In 1983 the Welsh Office produced a document —The All Wales Strategy for the Development of Services for Mentally Handicapped People/Strategaeth Cymru Gyfan Datblygiad Gwasanaethau Pobl dan Anfantais Meddyliol . This document proclaimed to the people of Wales that members of a society with mental handicap had a right to the same services as everyone else, had the right to be treated as individuals, and might need special assistance to make this possible. The Welsh Office promised funding to initiatives developed by county social services departments in conjunction with voluntary organisations and families. Members of Wales PPA quickly realised that these published beliefs were the same as their own, and that here was perhaps an opportunity to avail themselves of much-needed funding to establish support systems which would enable families to take their rightful place in the local playgroup or mother and toddler group. Development of an All Wales Strategy has involved long discussions at county level between social services department personnel, representatives from voluntary organisations, parents and sometimes consumers. PPA volunteers joined these discussions with a view to offering playgroups and mother and toddler groups as a resource for young children with mental handicap — an opportunity for integration right from the start. If integration at school age and afterwards is to be a real possibility a family with a handicapped child needs to be involved in the community, making friends and developing natural support systems from the beginning. Every local authority was required to submit a county development plan for acceptance by the Welsh Office before funds were released. PPA members sought to have their ‘referral schemes’ adopted and given high priority within the county plan. This involved PPA volunteers and staff in the tripartite consultations at county level, the preparation of budget submissions, agonising waits while plans were considered, elation when funding was agreed, disappointment when refused, months of hard work to set up a scheme or, when necessary, to re-draft the plan to try for funding again. LIAISON In 1985 the Welsh Office agreed to fund a Special Needs Liaison Officer for Wales PPA for three years to support the referral schemes in the counties. By 1987 seven county-based PPA referral schemes had been established and a branch scheme set up in the eighth county. Funding for the schemes is varied. Every county his received some support from All Wales Strategy sources varying from core funding for a coordinator and placement costs for children with mental handicap to one-off grants or payment of incidental expenses. Every county has had to seek additional funding to support placement costs for children who do  not have a mental handicap. Understandably there is reluctance within the authorities to diagnose a child under 5 as having a mental handicap, and there is a move to relax the criteria to include children with developmental delay amongst those eligible for funding. Alternative or additional funding has been sought from social services departments (non-Strategy), health authorities, education departments, Children in Need, trusts, and by fundraising. Two schemes received grant aid from Under Fives Initiative (Wales) which came to an end in March 1988. Each PPA county referral scheme is responsible for the finance and general administration of the scheme and employment of the coordinator. The financial requirements involve funding to employ a part-time coordinator and staff support for the scheme, expenses for coordinator and volunteers, training, publicity and placement costs for the child. Placement costs vary according to need but are likely to involve token payment for an extra helper within the playgroups and may include transport cost and playgroup fees. A toy library may be run in conjunction with the scheme. The referral scheme works in conjunction with statutory bodies and professionals from the social services and education departments and health authorities who will be invited to referral scheme management groups. Coordinator and parent and playgroup will seek advice and support from the professionals involved with the child when this is appropriate — health visitor, social worker, physiotherapist, speech therapist, community mental handicap team. Essential equipment to enable a child to participate in a group may be provided, opportunities for training may be shared. STATEMENTS The playgroup leader may be asked if she will support the parents' contribution to the Statement of special educational needs by describing the child's participation at playgroup, his needs and capabilities, adaptation and behaviour. The playgroup leader will usually offer her observations as part of the parents' contribution to the Statement. She will not, indeed cannot, make any form of assessment but will, in discussion with the parent, describe the activities the child enjoys and his responses to playgroup life in a relaxed, familiar and friendly atmosphere. The educational psychologist may be invited to observe a child it playgroup should this be deemed useful hut will not, as a rule, carry out a formal assessment during playgroup time which would thus single the child out from his/her peers and probably deprive the other children of their leader's care. PPA special needs referral schemes link into training courses organised generally by PPA within Wales and within the county — special needs is integrated into every foundation course and basic course. Training opportunities for helpers in the groups, for coordinators and management committees are offered. Short ‘special needs’ courses or informal talks may be arranged to develop confidence and awareness and understanding of integration."
ACA ACA-CTY-005 -0.34 "Foucault's Phantasms It is in the work of Michel Foucault that we find the most unrelenting offensive against historicist theories of history. But Foucault at least can hardly be accused of neglecting history as such. The demise of Althusserianism has meant that the extent to which subsequent writers, such as Foucault or even Derrida, continued to work within the problematic that his work had established, has tended to be overlooked. It was Althusser who, after Sartre, problematized the very concept of history and laid the basis for much subsequent theoretical investigation. In the post-Althusserian context of today it is nevertheless somewhat startling to find the Althusser of Reading Capital citing his debt to Foucault (along with Bachelard, Cavaillès, and Canguilhem) as one of our masters in reading learned works'. perhaps even more unexpected, in the light of the fact that a popular British Marxist position on Althusser is that he simply turned history into theory, is the choice of Foucault's Madness and Civilization (’ that great work') and The Birth of the Clinic as examples of the kind of history, focused on the necessity of the production of a concept, that he was advocating. In certain respects Foucault always remained close to the general positions from which Althusser worked, particularly in relation to the influence of Bachelard and his scepticism towards progressivist and homogeneous histories. All were concerned to establish the possibility of discontinuity in a history, as Althusser described it, no longer‘steeped in the ideology of the philosophy of the Enlightenment, i.e. in a teleological and therefore idealist rationalism’. But whereas Althusser followed Bachelard's and Cavaillès' preoccupation with the formal systems of the pure sciences and set theory, Foucault rather pursued Canguilhem's focus on the medical and biological sciences, which emphasized their cultural frame and the historical and institutional (both discursive and non-discursive) conditions of their emergence which, according to Canguilhem, ‘chronicle-history’ neglected. From Bachelard and Canguilhem, Foucault derived his emphasis on the history of science as an epistemological study of the formation of concepts, a process of separation and discrimination which defines both the object and the problem that is  being made intelligible. For Canguilhem the history of a concept will have its own specific temporality, demonstrating less a process of epistemological self-correction as in the pure sciences than the persistence of the problem within all the contradictory solutions and ideological values that have been given to it and which make up its history. This struggle is the inevitable result of disciplines which have no claim to the validation procedures of the pure sciences and involve non-discursive as well as discursive practices and forms of knowledge. Here the history of such sciences does not consist in the gradual unfolding and emergence of scientific truths, but rather of a history of ‘veridical discourses’. Truth, like historicity, is derived from particular discursive practices; it operates internally as a form of regulation, as well as being the historical product of the battle between different discursive regimes. Foucault's contribution was to adapt this type of analysis from the life-sciences to the human and social sciences. Typically, his history takes the form of establishing a concept of something that chronological history would assume had no history, for example, madness, or sexuality. In relation to the almost antithetical Marxist positions of Sartre and Althusser, Foucault does not, however, simply follow the latter rather than the former: he articulates through a historical perspective the problems that their work encountered and attempts to produce a new method of historical enquiry — though not a general theory of history as such — that is both theoretically coherent and politically effective with respect to the particular problems under examination. That History and Marxism as such are casualties of this process is one obvious reason why attacks upon Foucault have been particularly virulent. Foucault objects to historicism and Western humanism to the extent that they assume a continuous development, progress, and global totalization. To this he adds his own more individual list of suspect conceptual categories: the subject, class, ideology, repression, the science/non-science distinction, as well as any general theory of society, causality, or of history itself. It is interesting that despite this some writers are still prepared nevertheless to claim Foucault as a Marxist — perhaps less an indication of his Marxism than of his discursive power and the lack of alternatives within Marxism today. Foucault emphasizes that his work does not lay claim to universal or general categories, nor is it even homogeneous, a presupposition that, as he has shown, has less to do with the work as such than the critical construction of its ‘author’. Nevertheless we can say at least that his preoccupation with history has been consistent throughout: the articulation of repressed history in Madness and Civilization (1961), the historicity of history in The Order of Things (1966), the epistemic mutation of history and the theoretical difficulties of historiography in The Archaeology of knowledge (1969), and the attempt to write a different kind of history, ‘genealogy’, that demonstrates the emergence of new forms of  power in Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality (1976–84) Like many of those discussed in this book, Foucault endorses the ethico-political project of establishing forms of knowledge that do not simply turn the other into the same: as he put it in 1968, he wishes to find another politics than that which ‘since the beginning of the nineteenth century, stubbornly persists in seeing in the immense domain of practice only the epiphany of a triumphant reason, or in deciphering in it only the historico-transcendental destination of the West’. This focus on the link between the structures of knowledge and of power is increasingly related to an accompanying analysis of the discursive and technological mechanisms of repression and domination. These ethico-political concerns formed the basis of his early works on madness: as he announced in his first book,Mental Illness and Psychology (1954): One day an attempt must be made to study madness as an overall structure — madness freed and disalienated, restored in some sense to its original language. Madness and Civilization was such a study, but the assumption that it was possible simply to lift the repression and to let otherness speak for itself was questioned by Derrida in his well-known critique, ‘Cogito and the History of Madness’. It is in this context that we can see the importance of the so-called Derrida-Foucault debate which is often misrepresented, not least by Foucault himself, as a confrontation between ‘textuality’ and ‘history’. But Foucault's own subsequent work shows that it could not really be a question of choice on these terms, for the simple reason that, as he himself is at pains to point out in The Order of Things , history is itself a discursive practice: while the latter cannot be simply equated with the textual, it cannot be crudely opposed to it either. The dispute between Derrida and Foucault was less a question of text versus history than an argument about history itself. Derrida focuses on Foucault's claim that in Madness and Civilization he is writing a history of the Other. His critique centres on two related problems: in the first place if, as Foucault argues, the expulsion of madness by reason constitutes the possibility of history as such, so that this gesture of exclusion produces the fundamental structure of historicity, then the ‘classical’ moment of this proscription that he describes must be an example rather than an originary moment. In the second place, if reason is defined by its elimination of madness, and if history is a rational concept, the question then follows, how can you write a history of madness? Derrida comments: ‘It is the meaning of ‘’ history’or archia that should have been questioned first, perhaps'. Implicitly he is criticizing Foucault's understanding of the relation of the same to the other which posits madness as outside the sphere of reason. To regard the latter as systematically oppressing madness and  forcing it to the margins — to literature, or the hospital — is simply to repeat, in reverse, the very structure that is being criticized. Derrida contends that if madness is constituted as madness, as other, by reason, then this means that reason is itself defined through it and therefore already contains and depends upon it. Madness cannot be considered to exist outside the historical conditions of its production — and could never therefore be ‘restored…to its original language’ as Foucault hopes. The problem for Foucault is that this argument involves more than just madness as such, for it really amounts to a questioning of the very possibility of critique. In his early work we can see that Foucault's position involves a remarkable development of Althusser's hints that art can function as a privileged category that provides an ‘internal distance’ from ideology by relating histories, writing reports. Something of the same special place of ‘retreat’ for art, especially literature and painting, is to be found in Foucault. David Carroll has recently emphasized the significance of, a transgressive aesthetics or poetics of self-reflexivity' in his work. Such self-reflexivity, far from involving a turning inwards as is so often generally supposed, comprises rather an edge or void from which a critical perspective can be opened up: a ‘thinking of the outside’. So madness, or certain radical forms of writing, such as that of Sade, Bataille, Blanchot or Roussel, by transgressing the limits of order and turning back to reflect upon it, enable a space from which a critique can be made. This self-reflexivity operates at the limit of reason or history, eluding even the structure of the epistemes . In this schema, Foucault is therefore proposing a fundamental, enabling separation between writing and history. But after Derrida's essay, Foucault abandoned his claims that certain forms of literature could effect such a critical, reflective detachment. This led to two problems: is there then any space from which a critique can be established? and how does Foucault reformulate the relation of writing to history? In his subsequent work, the connection between the two would remain profoundly equivocal. The seriousness of Derrida's intervention can be discerned from Foucault's subsequent repudiation of the central thesis of Madness and Civilization and the change of direction that his work took thereafter. This is apparent from his rethinking of the ‘age-old distinction between the Same and the Other’. While he retained his criticisms of rationality, Foucault substituted the idea of an otherness at work within reason for that of a repressed alterity existing outside or beyond it. If madness or the other is always inside, then this means that it is always already a part of reason or the same; but it will also be exactly the element that reason is unable to comprehend, and will therefore work disruptively. This reformulation shows why it was necessary for Foucault to free himself from what he later termed ‘the repressive hypothesis’ of liberation. It also provides the context in which to consider both the claim that for the later Foucault knowledge is absolutely determined, leaving him in the impossible situation of requiring something  outside this for any prospect of critique, as well as the question of exactly how power and resistance are interdependent and to what extent they are separable. Any answer to these problems must take Foucault's own resituating of the dialectic of the same and the other into account. Even so, it is not at all obvious how he relocates writing in relation to the history to which it had until then been opposed. If it had previously operated critically outside history's limits, offering the only available possibility of critical distance, how might writing work transgressively within it? II DIFFERENTIATED HISTORIES In The Order of Things , published three years after Derrida's critique, Foucault re-examines the links between Enlightenment rationality and history and poses the questions about the latter which Derrida had suggested that Foucault's work invites. In the Preface he resituated his earlier formulations as follows: The history of madness would be the history of the Other — of that which, for a given culture, is at once interior and foreign, therefore to be excluded (so as to exorcise the interior danger) but by being shut away (in order to reduce its otherness); whereas the history of the order imposed on things would be the history of the Same — of that which, for a given culture, is both dispersed and related, therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities. (xxiv) Foucault thus modifies his argument that reason simply excluded madness and initiated the possibility of history by suggesting instead that the histories of the Other and of the Same are necessarily implicated within each other. But at the same time he refuses Derrida's equation of historicity with difference as such, instead reformulating his former thesis so that now history itself takes part in the epistemic shifts that he traces. Initially Foucault argues that the stasis of what he calls the ‘Classical Order’ gave way to ‘History’— which took over both as the form of knowledge and as the fundamental mode of being for empirical phenomena. By the end of The Order of Things , however, he revises this somewhat conventional thesis to suggest that what was involved was not so much a move from a static to a historical view of things as the break-up of a common, unified historical time-scheme in which every phenomenon had had its place in the same space and chronology. In place of a unity of time came the notion of discrete temporalities, with a recognition of a historicity proper to each discipline or area of knowledge. Instead of a great historical narrative common to ill, everything now had its own chronology and its own history. The effect of this was to dehistoricize man himself. Whereas formerly he had been the subject of history, taking pride of place in God's historical scheme from creation onwards, now ‘the human being no longer has any history: or rather, since he speaks, works, and lives, he finds himself interwoven in his own being with histories that are neither subordinate to him nor homogeneous with him’(368 — 9). Man was no longer the measure of all things. Two possibilities were developed to deal with man's new homelessness in the world, his exposure, as Foucault puts it, to the finitude of the event, which attempted to draw all these heterogeneous histories together again: either men sought for some fundamental law through which a new general history could be constituted, or historicity as such was defined in terms of‘man’— whether as progress, economic laws, or cultural totalities. The creation of man as centre was effected by defining him against other, now marginalized groups, such as women, the mad, or, we would add, the allegedly sub-human ‘native’. This move formed the basis for the human sciences which, through their organization around the figure of man, once more brought about a unity to History. We shall examine the relation of this new humanism to the history of Western colonialism in a later chapter: it is not a question that Foucault himself elaborates in the course of what is claimed to be an, ethnology of Western culture'. Rather he points to the theoretical paradox involved, namely that the human sciences' very emphasis on historicity as a mode of being was equally applicable to themselves as forms of knowledge, and inevitably destroyed any attempt to formulate universal laws comparable to those of the natural sciences. Here we can see a rather different perspective on the human alienation which Lukács describes; in Foucault's account, Marxism's attempt to reproduce the totality in itself falls within the terms of his argument by which totalizing theories of history are based on an anxiety derived from the break-up of its unity. Marxism's claim to the status of a science proper thus functions as a device to avoid the historicity through which it accounts for other phenomena . The Order of Things by contrast points to the emergence of historicity as a mode of understanding, and argues that ‘History’, both as a form of knowledge and as the primary state of being of empirical phenomena — broadly speaking, the assumption of all Marxisms —is itself a historical phenomenon . This means that history cannot provide an unquestionable ground for knowledge, and that historicity cannot claim an a priori privilege as the fundamental mode of being either. As the two ‘counter-sciences’ ethnology and psychoanalysis have suggested, history is simply one possible discursive form of understanding — even if its problematic of temporality spills over into many others. In making this argument, however, Foucault is not concerned to dispense with history — rather to make history itself an object of historical investigation and to question its presuppositions. In particular, he challenges Hegel's equation in the Phenomenology of the evolution of history with the developing consciousness of man himself. Although this has been particularly influential for many forms of Western Marxism, it also represents a deviation from Marx's original claim that history is the effect of material  conditions rather than of human consciousness. In this way Foucault could be said to be returning to Marx in removing the subject from the centre of history, were it not for the fact that he dispenses with the consolations of Marx's historicism also. In this situation he asks, how do we come to terms with the event, with continuities and discontinuities, in short with history as difference and not just the story of sameness? Foucault adopts a strategy, obviously indebted to Bachelard, designed to restore the otherness that History by definition must disallow: he produces an account of epistemic shifts, with prior epistemes presented as altogether estranged from the present. In order to come to terms with the past, the initial gesture must be to confront its strangeness, rather than to seek for similarities and continuities so that it can be equated with the present and thus, in effect, dehistoricized. Following Althusser's suggestion that a historical problematic might be altogether invisible even to experiencing subjects, in The Order of Things Foucault analyses what he provocatively calls ‘the historical a priori ’ according to which the knowledges of grammar, natural history and wealth, and their epistemic replacements, philology, biology, and political economy, were structured. But as with Althusser's modes of production, so Foucault's attempt to elaborate a ‘positive unconscious ’ of knowledge was criticized by Sartre, and subsequently by many others, for being unable to give any account of change and for implying a total discontinuity between periods. The objection that Foucault neglects history because he does not attempt to give reasons why the epistemic shifts he describes occurred is perhaps inevitable but also begs the question: for conventional historiography has in general done nothing but account for such shifts — which has meant that it has consistently failed to recognize alterity and incommensurability in its insistent search for continuities with the past. Without history as a form of mediation the differences return as the problem, and it was this which, according to Foucault,The Order of Things was really trying to address. Here we might recall Derrida's criticism of Levinas's history ‘as a blinding to the other, and as the laborious procession of the same’. In the face of a history which obscures such discontinuities, the first stage for Foucault, therefore, is to defamiliarize it by reconstituting it without the mythology of a continuous History which has turned difference into identity. It is often assumed that Foucault is simply the philosopher of discontinuity, merely substituting it where previously there had been continuity; but the discontinuous is emphasized only because so much stress is normally placed on the continuous. It is not just a question of exchanging one for the other. This has a methodological implication as well: all too often it is assumed that Foucault's stress on disruption can be taken as equivalent to randomness, as we have seen with Perry Anderson. However, it is more helpful to consider it in the context of Canguilhem, who emphasized that the life sciences, like the natural sciences, require their own specific mode of history; they show that historical method itself must be  heterogeneous, in the sense that there is no single method applicable to the whole range of different histories. Even the history of discontinuities is itself impermanent and discontinuous. If certain forms of history stress continuity, try to account for change, the history of science by contrast must be disjointed, for it is made up of a series of corrections in which the errors of the past have to be simply discarded. Foucault, as we have seen, is also criticized on the grounds that he cannot give a cause for the shifts he describes, but this criticism itself begs the question insofar as it assumes a certain kind of history, which itself presupposes that there was a cause in the sense of a single uniform causality, rather than a disconnectedness in the scientific mode. In the context of conventional historiography, Foucault argues that the point is to analyse the different kinds of transformation, the complex ‘play of dependencies’, links and redistributions, rather than to provide yet another account of change, succession and its causes. The Order of Things , although in many ways Foucault's most influential work, remains, however, an oddity in certain respects: first, that in arguing for an a priori common to a (limited) number of knowledges, Foucault at times seems to be advocating a structural key between different levels within the episteme , thus restoring the form of the essential section so criticized by Althusser. Foucault has even been accused of returning, in this work, to the concept of a totality in the episteme ; it has certainly been somewhat hastily assumed that the latter can be appropriated more or less as a new way of describing a historical ‘period’. This fails to recognize, however, the extent to which it articulates only the structure of certain specific forms of knowledge rather than some single overarching principle. The constant emphasis on its being the Western episteme suggests immediate problems for any assumption that it constitutes a totality. The episteme rather delineates what Foucault calls a ‘cluster of transformations’; these, he suggests, enable the substitution of ‘differentiated analyses for the themes of a totalising history: They allow us to describe, as the episteme of a period, not the sum of its knowledge, nor the general style of its research, but the deviation, distances, the oppositions, the differences, the relations of its multiple scientific discourses: the epistemic is not a sort of grand underlying theory , it is a space of dispersion , it is an open field of relationships and no doubt indefinitely specifiable . They allow us furthermore to describe not the great history which would carry along all the sciences in a single trajectory, but the types of history — that is to say, of retentivity and transformation — which characterize different discourses…the episteme is not a slice of history common to all the sciences: it is a simultaneous play of specific remanences . finally they allow us to situate the different thresholds in their respective place: for nothing proves in advance…that their chronology is the same for all types of discourse… The episteme is not a general stage of reason, it is a complex relationship of successive displacements. This is very different from the integral paradigms of Thomas Kuhn to which Foucault's epistemes are sometimes compared. But if The Order of Things is thus concerned to analyse ‘ensembles of discourses’ that do not form a totality, it does not focus on the ways in which such forms of knowledges relate to the institutions in which and through which they are produced. In The Archaeology of knowledge Foucault corrects this by addressing the difficulties of making knowledges intelligible as a part of their institutional, social and political practices. III ARCHAEOLOGY Foucault's distrust of conventional forms of history, as we have seen, is a consistent thread in his project, as is his insistence that his historical method is limited to addressing specific problems — often comparable to those posed by the social sciences — to historical documents and practices in order to make them intelligible. Only once, however, does he devote a whole book to the problem of historical methodology. In The Archaeology of knowledge he develops his suggestion in The Order of Things that an epistemological mutation is taking place today with regard to the very concept and methodology of history. The book is both an account of and an intervention in that process, veering between the descriptive and the prescriptive. It begins by delineating the epistemological shift: the old order could be termed ‘History’, a continuous and chronological historiography, including Hegelianism and related forms of Marxism, with its philosophies of history, its assumptions of a rational, progressive and teleological historical development, its desire to discover a meaning in history, its questioning of the relativity of historical knowledge, and its use of categories such as tradition, the history of ideas, the oeuvre , the author and the book. Against this Foucault contrasts the work of the Annales school which analyses long continuities in certain social forms: The old questions of the traditional analysis (What link should be made between disparate events? Flow can a causal succession be established between them? What continuity or overall significance do they possess? Is it possible to define a totality, or must one be content with reconstituting connections?) are now being replaced by questions of another type: which strata should be isolated from others? What types of series should be established? What criteria of periodisation should be adopted for each of them? What system of relations (hierarchy, dominance, stratification, univocal determination, circular causality) may be established between them? What series of series may be established? And in what large-scale chronological table may distinct series of events be determined? (3 — 4) Foucault notes that, at the same time as the Annales school and others were constructing a history according to the long durée , in the history of science, philosophy, and literature, attention was turning in exactly the opposite direction, that is away from vast unities towards phenomena of rupture, discontinuity, displacement and transformation, towards different temporalities as well as architectonic unities. Here he instances in particular the work of Bachelard, Canguilhem, Serres, Guéroult, and Althusser. He argues that, given the proliferation of both discontinuities and long periods, the problem is now to constitute the series, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series. In other words, rather than set these antithetical approaches against each other as one might have expected, Foucault suggests that they are part of the same mutation. Foucault characterizes this epistemic shift in terms of the difference between what he calls ‘total’ and ‘general’history, or, History and archaeology. He explains this as follows. Total, or, elsewhere, global, history assumes a spatio-temporal continuity between all phenomena, and a certain homogeneity between them insofar as they all express the same form of historicity — Althusser's essential section — whereas in general history the problem is precisely to determine the relation between different series: whereas a total history draws everything together according to a single principle, a general history analyses the space of dispersion and heterogeneous temporalities. Total history seeks to reconstitute the overall form of a society according to some fundamental principle, law, or form, be it metaphysical or material, while general history despite its name is by no means concerned to produce a general theory of history, nor even a cohesive or comprehensive view, but rather to conduct a historical investigation according to particular problems, opening up a field ‘in which one could describe the singularity of practices, the play of their relations’. Foucault specifies the difference between them by contrasting their relation to the document: the historians of total history have been engaged above all in the interpretation of documents, attempting to reconstitute the past, to give it an inner meaning (always available only to the historian), to recover a voice and allow it to speak. The historians of a general history, on the other hand, reject interpretation as such in favour of making the evidence of documents intelligible by posing questions to them, constituting through such questions what counts as the series of historical events, its elements, its limits, and its relation to other series, or what rules operated for particular discursive practices. This stress on intelligibility is a useful corrective to the widespread current assumption — for which Foucault himself is also partly responsible — that history is just another form of interpretation. Unexpectedly, perhaps, Foucault traces the beginnings of this epistemic mutation in the thinking of history to Marx. This implies a challenge that contemporary Marxism has yet to address. As we have seen, for some  Foucault can apparently be dismissed with ease as merely the philosopher of discontinuity, a description which is hardly adequate; for others, criticism takes the form that he simply relativizes history, but this is really no better, for history is itself a mode of demonstrating the relativity, temporariness, and temporality of phenomena. Unless it is possible to prove the identification of History with Truth, as Sartre tried to do, then the claim that a single univocal History is not relative only works by removing all other elements in the set to which it could be compared, thus making a set of one. Effectively, however, all this does is to turn all history into a single event — which, paradoxically, dehistoricizes it. What has not been adequately considered is Foucault's characterization of an epistemological shift within the theorization of history itself. He suggests not only that it begins with Marx but that he himself forms part of this mutation, which means that, according to his argument, in order to dismiss him you would have to dismiss Marx also. Foucault thus does not merely set up an alternative history, but contends that that alternative is part of a displacement that is in the process of replacing the history that preceded it. It is therefore necessary to address not only his theoretical and methodological but also his historical arguments — something that his critics have singularly failed to do. The Archaeology of Knowledge thus analyses the shift in historiography of which Foucault himself is the most powerful contemporary representative. As epistemic breaks go, however, it seems to be a slow one: Foucault attributes its hesitancy to a fundamental reluctance to think difference rather than the reassuring form of the identical: it is, he comments, ‘as if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own thought’. Here we encounter the continuing dominance of the philosophy of the subject, which, according to Foucault, was specifically introduced in order to provide a ‘shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness’ against the intrusion of heterogeneity. Continuous history and the subject are thus dependent on each other. Instead of centring his analyses on the knowledge derived from the experience of the subject, Foucault investigates the conditions of emergence of the subject as the basis of knowledge; he argues that at the same time as it was widely proposed as the one saving good of human civilization it also facilitated a more sinister operation. Just as History involved the legitimation as knowledge of certain forms of political power, so the production of the subject by the human sciences as an object of knowledge also enabled a new form of political control: ‘The individual is not a pre-given entity which is seized on by the exercise of power. The individual, with his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies’. In Discipline and Punish Foucault demonstrates how the individual is constituted through specific technologies of power; in the History of Sexuality , he shows the extent to which the human sciences, including medicine and the practice of psychoanalysis, facilitated the extension of control beyond the limits of the body in the construction of the inner realms of subjectivity, consciousness and experience. Foucault argues that a whole series of movements since the nineteenth century, including various anthropologizing Marxisms, have developed complicitly with this so as to preserve the sovereignty of the subject against Marx's and others' decentrings: positivism, the Hegelian Marxism of Lukács, the Marxist humanism of Sartre, as well as various theories of cultural totalities such as that of the Frankfurt School. Dispensing with the subject necessarily also means the end of the use of the category of ideology; in this context Foucault's later work counters Althusser's influential essay on ideological state apparatuses. Many of those now hostile to Althusser continue to endorse this essay, which offers a theory of institutional power dependent on the categories of the subject and ideology. Foucault is critical of such a theory not just because it is based on a science/non-science distinction which for him is simply the product of a particular discursive formation which claims access to the real, rather than involving any epistemological questions of truth or objectivity, but also because it produces the notion of ideology as a secondary mediation (as in Althusser's interpellation) in an inside/outside structure between the determinants of power and the individual subject. For Foucault, the tendency of theories of ideology to entrammel themselves in the categories of psychoanalysis, even with the eternal in Althusser's case, means that they themselves begin to utilize the very procedures of individuation that they ought to have been analysing. The questions of the subject and of ideology raise as their corollary the problem of what position of enunciation the historian can claim in relation to his or her own work. Foucault is particularly critical of the appropriating structure of totalization, Marxist or otherwise, insofar as it implies the superiority of the theorist who produces the totalization of knowledge; in the same way, he distrusts the use of history as an encompassing framework because it works as a power structure that enables the expropriation and control of the past according to the perspective and truth of the present. It elides the fact that the historian will always also be historically located and therefore cannot be in a position to produce a final totalization, a dialectical situation anticipated by Sartre. Foucault argues that just as there can be no general theory of history, but only particular answers to particular questions which make individual practices intelligible, so the intellectual can best hope to be specific rather than universal (universal in the sense of proposing transcendent values, systems, totalities, narratives or teleologies). This does not mean that the intellectual therefore nihilistically celebrates dispersion, fragmentation or relativity: rather she or he is the person who, facing such dispersion but without conceding to the nostalgic desire for totalization, poses the questions and constitutes the series and continuities for analysis — and thus for transformation — while attempting to respect its heterogeneity. This suggests why, contrary to the way in which certain commentators tend to represent them, it is clear that for Foucault, as for Lyotard or Derrida, total fragmentation would be as counter-productive — and as impossible — as total synthesis. As Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak puts it: ‘Theoretical descriptions cannot produce universals. They can only ever produce provisional generalizations, even as the theorist realizes the crucial importance of their persistent production’. Such arguments will have no pretensions, by definition, to knowledge-claims that affect to rise above the historical conditions in which they are made. IV HISTORY AND THE EVENT Despite his programmatic emphasis in the Archaeology on the discursive formation as a means of making intelligible those knowledges that are formulated through their institutional components, Foucault turned away from this kind of historical enquiry because it was too ‘clean, conceptually aseptic’— in other words, too apolitical. Foucault therefore abandons analysis of epistemes for the more Nietzschean ‘genealogy’, which allows him to articulate conflict in terms of differentiated histories with their own conceptual specificities and their own times, while retaining the possibility of the formulation of aims and intentions: I would call genealogy…a form of history which can account for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects etc., without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history. Genealogy develops the possibility broached in the Archaeology that in a general history different significances can be accorded to events, depending on‘their correlation with other previous or simultaneous events, discursive or not’. Here it is the problem the historian poses that determines what constitutes an event and what status it has. Foucault's genealogy means that by asking a question, posing a problem, you set up a generality against which you constitute events and arrange them in a series. The construction of that generality does not pretend to be the only possible one — the same event could operate in all sorts of different ways in different series, temporalities, which would mean that, strictly speaking, it was no longer the same event, for it would have been dispersed in their different rarefactions. This is not supposed to suggest that events cannot be said to occur straightforwardly in the real but rather that when set up in any series, narrative, or history they are constructed as such events retrospectively by the historian. If all history attempts to conceptualize the event, to wean it from its finitude, then Foucault like many of his contemporaries is concerned to  respect its singularity. In the essay ‘Theatum philosophicum’(1970), written shortly after the Archaeology , Foucault attempts to avoid the snares of the problem of the relation of the event to the totality, or the particular to the general, that beset both Sartre and Althusser, by arguing that the event as event is only constituted through its repetition in thought as a ‘phantasm’: ‘it makes the event indefinite so that it repeats itself as a singular universal’. This argument, which Foucault derives from Deleuze, although at the same time he tellingly invokes Sartre's theoretical formulation designed to solve exactly the same problem, provides a way of avoiding the incommensurability of the relation of the event to the concept by allowing ‘the disjunctive affirmation of both’— thus solving the problem that the concept, as a part of the language of generality, will inevitably travesty the event's singularity: Logique du sens causes us to reflect on matters that philosophy has neglected for many centuries: the event (assimilated in a concept, from which we vainly attempted to extract it in the form of a fact , verifying a proposition, of actual experience , a modality of the subject, of concreteness , the empirical content of history); and the phantasm (reduced in the name of reality and situated at the extremity, the pathological pole, of a normative sequence: perception-image-memory-illusion). After all, what most urgently needs thought in this century, if not the event and the phantasm? Well, it might be hard to see it as that important. Foucault's gesture, however, marks the radical scope of such an anti-essentialist project which exploits Plato's admission that there can not only be a good copy but also a bad one (phantasma)— characteristic of the secondary representations of the poets. Deleuze reverses Plato by validating this simulacrum of the good copy on the grounds that, precisely because it is a bad copy, it breaks down all adequation between copy and model, appearance and essence, event and Idea. As plato realized, it is dangerous because its effect is to dethrone the Idea from its position of Truth. Moreover, because the bad copy by definition cannot claim to be copying anything but itself, it creates its ‘original’ retroactively, so that the copy precedes the original in a ghostly originary repetition. Descombes describes a comparable paradoxical structure in his account of ‘originary delay’: a first event cannot be the first event if it is the only event; it cannot be said to be a first until it is followed by a second, which then retrospectively constitutes it as the first — which means that its firstness hovers over it as its meaning without being identifiable with it as such. Thus, the phantasm, rather than constituting the event, hovers over its surface like a cloud, as an effect of meaning not identifiable with anything in the event as such. Deleuze's best-known example of how this works is the battle: ‘Where’’, he asks, ‘is the battle? What we call a battle consists of a vast, heterogeneous array of individual actions in the field — fighting, firing, charging, wounding — none of which constitutes ‘the battle’ as such. ‘The battle’ hovers over the individual actions like in incorporeal cloud, distinct from them, but at the same time making up a surface of their meaning-effect, a simulacrum that brings the event into being at the moment when language and event coincide. Foucault recognizes in Deleuze's account of events as singularities, points or intensities on a surface ready to be actualized in any particular form or meaning, the potential for pushing further his own notion of history as a genealogical series. Such genealogy works by repeating the (non) event, as an event, in thought — in a structure comparable to Freud's ‘deferred action, or ‘retroactivity’. No more than the latter does it seek to lay claim to ‘the real, or Truth as such. Foucault inflects this model by focusing on the possibility of constructing the series so as to repeat the disruption and discontinuity of the (non-original) event. In freud, the point is similarly not just the question — on which most attention gets focused — of whether the event ‘really’ happened (a good copy) or was subsequently fantasized by the experiencing subject (a bad copy), but rather that it is repeated as a disruptive event that fissures ordinary forms of psychic continuity and therefore gains analytic attention in the present. The same structure can be utilized by the historian so that the writing of history can itself become a disruptive event and consequently a form of political intervention. V FOUCAULT'S PHANTASMS If Foucault proposes the philosophy of the phantasm as a way for the historian to produce the meaning-effect of the event while still doing justice to its singularity, it also offers a way of thinking through some of the paradoxes that we have encountered in the problematic conceptualization of history. From Sartre to Foucault history has repeatedly emerged as a contradictory concept, both totalizing and detotalizing, essentialist and non-essentialist. Such contradictions can be productive: the attempt to reject historicism absolutely results either in an utter particularism or in a surreptitious return of historicism in a different form. Only an understanding that recognizes that an irresolvable tension works within the historical schema itself will be in a position to make its contradictory claims productive. This possibility is outlined by Foucault himself as early as The Order of Things . He comments: The more History attempts to transcend its own rootedness in historicity, and the greater the efforts it makes to attain, beyond the historical relativity of its origin and its choices, the sphere of universality, the more clearly it bears the marks of its historical birth, and the more evidently there appears through it the history of which it is itself a part…inversely, the more it accepts its relativity, and the more deeply it sinks into the movement it shares with what it is recounting, then the more it tends to  the slenderness of the narrative, and all the positive content it obtained for itself through the human sciences is dissipated. (371) History becomes the impossibility between this Scylla and Charybdis — in Lyotard's terms, it contains within its own project an incommensurable difference . It can only be described in terms of its organization according to an economy of logical tensions or strictures, of demands and constraints. It is, as Derrida comments, a question of showing: that history is impossible, meaningless, in the finite totality, and that it is impossible, meaningless, in the positive and actual infinity: that history keeps to the difference between totality and infinity. Thus both historicism or entirely differentiated histories are in themselves impossibilities: history will always involve a form of historicism, but a historicism that cannot be sustained. It is thus a contradictory (quasi) concept — a phantasm — in which neither the elements of totalization nor difference can be definitively achieved or dispatched. This means that history can be theorized not so much as a contradictory process but as a concept that must enact its own contradiction with itself: ‘this difference is what is called History ’. In this context, we may recall that Althusser, rather than simply criticizing the notion of history as a totality as Foucault often tended to do, argued for the rearticulation of different histories within a decentred totality, on the assumption that history cannot do without one. Was it simply incoherence on his part when he suggested that his ‘science of history’, even though it allows for differentiated histories, still demands to be considered within a general concept of history? We have seen the ways in which Sartre's Critique shows how totalization cannot work without a movement of self-transcendence, a repeated interpolation of an excess beyond the totality which paradoxically then means that the totality can no longer be a totality. Although Sartre's inability to effect self-totalization is often presented as a failure, the movement of history that he describes is increasingly enacted through his own writing. Such a shift is not immediately discernible in Foucault. His Deleuzian notion of the phantasmatic event constituted a brief attempt to reformulate the relation of the particular to the general as a problem of history. But he made little effort to develop this outside his own definitions of the genealogical method, while his shift into the problematics of power seemed to lead him into a labyrinth from which it was virtually impossible to extract himself. The philosophy of the phantasm may, however, help us to do justice to the event of Foucault himself. One of the oddities of Foucault's work is that it seems riven by an internal tension — for example, as peter Dews notes, while on the one hand Foucault lays claims to a form of objectivity in his archaeology, and eschews interpretation in favour of ‘intelligibility’, on the  other hand throughout his life he was also prone to endorse a Nietzschean insistence on the interminability of interpretation. For Dews this equivocation over the epistemological status of his own discourse is a sign of an uncontrollable oscillation: ‘the shifting perspectives of Foucault's work’, he writes, ‘do powerfully illuminate, but at the same time fall victim to, the contradictory processes which they address’. But such a self-undermining of the epistemological status of his own work is also characteristic of Lacan, and of Freud — indeed, Dews argues that this constitutes Freud's greatest strength. We might therefore wonder whether its appearance in Foucault, far from being the result of theoretical ineptitude, does not involve simulacra, or ghostly bad copies, similarly designed to undermine the claims of theoretical mastery, and to produce in his texts surface-effects of the kind of heterogeneity we might expect from someone who had contested the unifying function of ‘the author’. With respect to history, the vacillations of Foucault's writing enact the impossibility of its simultaneous finitude and infinitude, the irresolvable conflict between history as meaning and history as difference, between history as a teleology and eschatology and history as the event, as finitude and mortality. Here we once more encounter the recognition that at a conceptual level the idea of history cannot be taken further: rather it can only be addressed through a tension in the writing itself. The early opposition between writing and history which enabled a critique from an outer limit has thus been replaced by a dissension within Foucault's own discursive practice. Instead of locating the other elsewhere in the transgressive writing of literature or madness, Foucault himself becomes plato's banished poet, and enacts in his language a supplementary simulacrum of the delirium of history. As Maurice Blanchot has put it: ‘And were not his own principles more complex than his official discourse, with its striking formulations, led one to think?’ VI HISTORY AS POWER In later work Foucault veers away from his most radical philosophical insights towards an analysis of discursive and extra-discursive systems of domination and exploitation, with increasing focus on the apparently more political question of power. But perhaps this shift is not so distinct: for the interaction of power and resistance, which mimes the mutual contamination and transmutation of Freud's death-drive and pleasure principle, also operates is a simulacrum of the ungraspable, vacillating manoeuvres of Foucault's formulations of history. Whereas Foucault was inclined to remark that in retrospect he considered that all his work had been about power, it seems almost equally possible that his analyses of power constitute a continuing meditation on the phantasm. Although in no sense a general theory, Foucault's notion of power reformulates the problem of agency and determinism which had beset Sartre and many others by focusing on the  possibility of making intelligible the strategies and techniques of local operations of power without relying on the dialectic of ideology and the consciousness of subjects, or on their corollary, the assumption that power operates globally and homogeneously. The absence of the category of consciousness inevitably plays down the role of individual subjects and thus of individual agency and resistance as a result of specific acts of will. If this causes difficulties for some, Foucault's scepticism with regard to the tendency to inflate the effect of individual agency can only be compared to the position of many Marxisms in which resistance and revolution are hardly the privilege of the individual as such, but rather of collective class action. Those who forget the virtues of solidarity in order to protest against the downgrading of individual agency might recall that it has been intellectuals who have been most prone to inflate the significance of individuals — particularly intellectuals — to the same degree that their theories propose universal categories and claim universal effects. Moreover the exclusive focus on ‘resistance’ as a privileged political category is itself open to question. As with his genealogical history, Foucault's meditations on power are not themselves without problems, but reactions to them can also be too hastily dismissive, often because it is assumed that they are proposed as a general theory. For example, after the History of Sexuality much has been made of Foucault's analysis of power as a form of totalizing paranoia; but the analyses in that book, of, for example , the shift from the Catholic confession box to the confessional psychoanalytic couch, are both culturally and historically specific, and Foucault's remarks about them need to be put in the same perspective. After all, if ‘the system’ really was bent upon the form of totalizing control that according to Foucault psychoanalysis, for example, enables, it is worth recalling that psychoanalysis has never been adopted by the state as such and that its activities remain confined to a few very limited districts in a handful of prosperous cities round the world. Similarly, those who claim that Foucault removes the possibility of resistance as such miss the point: all that he downgrades is a theory of resistance centred on the individual subject as sovereign agent. He argues that to focus analysis in this way neglects the disciplinary forms and technologies through which power operates. The claim for a straightforward oppositional kind of resistance also assumes that subjects can resist from a position outside the operations of power, according to the dominant inside/outside model of conventional politics. This is the context in which to place Foucault's own recognition after Derrida's critique that he could no longer postulate madness or the other as outside, after which he maintained that the other is also always inside; he formulates the structures of power in exactly the same way, so that the forces of domination and resistance are caught up, sometimes indistinguishably, within each other. Acts of resistance may of course continue to be initiated through individual acts of will, but as for Sartre  there is no guarantee that they will produce intended effects. An awareness of this structure does not mean that strategic intervention is either useless or impossible; but it does mean that analysis of how resistance actually operates, in what conditions it succeeds or fails, needs an altogether more complex model. Foucault's account of power is thus difficult to the degree to which he argues that the exercise and resistance of power work in a disruptive rather than a dialectical relation to each other, suggesting that ‘points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network’. Where there is power, there is resistance: contrary to what is often assumed, it is the absence of resistance which is impossible. power is a two-way process. Just as the exercise of power is heterogeneous, so is resistance; Foucault's point is simply that ‘there is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary’. Resistance does not operate outside power, nor is it necessarily produced oppositionally: it is imbricated within it, the irregular term that consistently disturbs it, rebounds upon it, and which on occasions can be manipulated so as to rupture it altogether: Just as the network of power relations ends by forming a dense web that passes through apparatuses and institutions, without being exactly localized in them, so too the swarm of points of resistance traverses social stratifications and individual unities. And it is doubtless the strategic codification of these points of resistance that makes a revolution possible, somewhat similar to the way in which the state relies on the institutional integration of power relationships. It is in this way that Foucault can return to the possibility of doing historical work that has political force through his notion of genealogy, which means, as he puts it, ‘that I begin my analysis from a question posed in the present’. The question enables the tactical use of historical knowledge in contemporary political situations which necessitate the posing of the question with which genealogy begins. Such politics stress the local or the specific without assuming that they constitute the starting point for a global hegemony into which they will be subsumed. Foucault does not aim to produce ‘a’ politics any more than ‘a’history. It is this factor which, perhaps above all, has enabled the critical use of Foucault's analyses of power in demarcated areas of analysis. Ironically, Foucault's most problematic ‘theory’ has generated the most successful and probing historical work among his followers. VII CODA: THE NEW HISTORICISM The relation of Foucault's politics to history leads to the question of the tactical use of Foucault himself in current forms of criticism; in addition to his extensive use by historians and sociologists, he is also associated with those movements that have become known as ‘new historicism’ and ‘cultural materialism’. The former is identified closely with Foucault, while the latter owes its allegiance to Raymond Williams, and really only amounts to a way of describing British ex-Marxists. New historicism is most concerned with the late Foucault, in particular with representations and mechanisms of power, the means through which cultural artefacts can be shown to be not passive reflectors of the history of their time but active producers of it. This charting of the circulating relations between aesthetic and other forms of production works best in those historical periods, such as the Renaissance, where there was no modern concept of Literature, thus allowing literary texts to be mapped against the political and other discourses of which they formed a part. New historicism emphasizes the way in which certain rituals and practices, for example of kingship, are equally a part of the processes and representation of power — whether at a beheading, a masque or in a poem. At the same time, it can also bring out the complex ways in which such forms of power also produce their own forms of resistance; as critics like Stephen Greenblatt demonstrate, these are not separable processes but are simultaneous effects of power. The illustration of such a double logic working at a textual level often comes to seem remarkably close to a deconstructive analysis: in the same way as Derrida or de Man could be said to be deconstructing received readings that have institutional purchase, so the new historicists shift our understanding of institutionalized historical accounts. However, the very historical focus poses the problem of agency and containment in a more immediate way that demonstrates some of the dilemmas that follow from Foucault's genealogical history. The real difficulty, as Greenblatt shows, is what status can be accorded the category of subversion or resistance: what is the historical status of the ‘subversive, elements of a text? If the process of the construction of knowledge can be shown to work against itself, this can operate because the ideas of the dominant order are not in fact threatened by alternatives which, with hindsight, may appear radical to us now. As the cultural materialists concede, subversive thoughts are not subversive until they become a practice. Can they be shown to have had historical effects? From the point of view of a radical politics, the onus on the critic, therefore, is to show the ways in which such subversions can be shown to have produced specific instances of change. Correspondingly, as Greenblatt argues, Renaissance ideas which might be subversive today are ignored in favour of‘radical’ ideas which seem to echo our own. Both groups follow Foucault to the extent that they neither propose, nor utilize, a general theory of history as such; but unlike Foucault they simply tend to shelve the whole problem so as to avoid its theoretical difficulties. So, despite the Lukácsian resonance of its name, new historicism abandons both the notion of history as a readable background to literary texts, and the Marxist dependency on reflection, in its effort to recontextualize literary texts in a more immediate way with other forms of social production. For their part, the British cultural materialists quickly adopted a name which tactfully removes the suggestion of Marxism as such. In the context of the present discussion of history, moreover, it is highly significant that traditional ‘historical materialism’ has been jettisoned in favour of the anthropological ‘cultural materialism’. The cultural materialists abandon the traditional Marxist use of history as a ground for truth in favour of bringing history into the present day in order to intervene in their own institutional and academic political context. In this case it becomes less a matter of addressing contemporary political problems than of resisting institutional power, namely those critical readings which have recently claimed cultural hegemony, and of providing instead alternative accounts which insist on heterogeneity and resistance in historical texts. An identification is then implicitly or explicitly made with parallel forms of political struggle in our own day. In other words, where yesterday's historian looked for the history of an oppressed working class, today's historian looks for marginalized groups, and those who have transgressed social norms. Whether they actually were subversive becomes irrelevant to the extent that they can now be retrieved to offer a potential that has a contemporary, that is twentieth-century, political relevance. To this extent we could say that the cultural materialists re-assert a form of reflection theory, where history has become a mirror in which contemporary political priorities have been substituted for the former certain ground of Marxist analysis. The cultural materialists are inclined to separate the self-contradictory differences isolated by the new historicists into a more conventional political paradigm of opposing classes, of hegemony and subversion. Similarly, though Foucault is often invoked, there is a marked tendency to continue to utilize theoretical categories such as ideology, consciousness and the subject. Here it is salutary to recall Foucault's scepticism with regard to the ‘perilous ease’ with which politics quickly assumes positions that provide intellectual guarantees rather than specific analyses of particular relations or transformations; he reacts in the same way to political analogies, and correspondences, or to hasty links with current political practices. To the last, Foucault himself remained suspicious of any ‘progressive politics, if that meant that it continued to be linked to a (hidden) meaning, origin, or the subject. But if the cultural materialists, unlike the more fastidious new historicists, cheerfully ignore the theoretical consequences of Foucault's work for many Marxist concepts, in other ways they are closer to him  insofar as they make clear in their work their own political priorities and commitments. Nevertheless it is worth recalling that Foucault never starts at the political, but rather begins with a contemporary problem and then addresses questions to politics about it. He argues that intellectual work need not always be measured against immediate political ends; rather the question to ask is what project is it undertaking, what problem is it analysing? It should always be possible for the intellectual to justify and to show the grounds on which any particular activity has been constituted. At the same time, it is too easy to condemn certain forms of work for being apolitical simply because they do not correspond to a certain paradigm of immediate political effectivity. Political interventions can also work according to different time scales. But if the cultural materialists tend to place a politics rather than a problem as the starting point of their enquiry, they do emphasize the deployment of specialized knowledges in the service of the popular political struggles of today. This suggests a closeness to Foucault's notion of genealogy that the more strictly academic new historicists, whose own politics remain more carefully hidden, ignore."
ACA ACA-F98-001 -0.39 "The Ninth British Library Research Lecture Computers and the humanities Anthony Kenny The British Library 1992 Scholars in the humanities, like researchers in other subjects, make use of computers for word-processing, for cataloguing the books in their departmental libraries, and also for desk-top publishing. This generic computer use is not my topic. I want to talk about the use of computers in actual research, and the features of that use which derive from the special characteristics of the humanities. University lecturers in the humanities are making increasing use of computers for teaching purposes; but this too lies outside my scope. The uses of the computer in humanities research can be divided into three main kinds, depending on the nature of the objects studied. A humanities researcher may use a computer to study strings (as in natural language processing or the analysis of literary texts) or to study numbers (of discrete items or events, as in social and economic history) or to study icons, whether visual (as in art history), or acoustic (as in musicology). Of course individual humanities disciplines make use of more than one of these types of computer study: the student of literary style will make statistical studies of the frequency of the lexical strings and grammatical features identified in his chosen text; the historian may have occasion to search through and analyse the texts of his primary sources in machine-readable form. In art history a large part of electronic data processing takes the form of cataloguing works of art, and only a small proportion of research concerns pattern recognition or digitization of images; in musicology it has only recently become possible to study scores directly input to the computer without the mediation of alphanumeric code. In all humanities disciplines the computer is used in an endeavour to replace intuition with quantification. Linguists, students of literature, art historians and musicologists all seek to identify styles, and the similarity and differences between them. Common to all these disciplines is the question: what statistics define a style? How far can a style be identified with an aggregate of statistical features? Similarly , a historian will make use of statistical techniques to give objective substance to intuitively sensed historical processes or trends. In all humanities disciplines the use of computers seems to have passed through three stages, each corresponding roughly to a decade. The first stage was the period of pioneering work: the abortive first attempts at machine translation; the earliest computer concordances; the early authorship studies of Morton, Ellegard, Mosteller and Wallace; the first conferences on computing in the humanities (1964–7) and the more specialised ones in history and anthropology (from 1962) and in literature and linguistics (from 1970). During this period concordances to many major works of literature were produced by computer, but published in traditional hard copy. Many of these early projects were the work of interdisciplinary research teams, including not only humanities scholars but senior information scientists, responsible for custom-designed software. This period lasted until about the end of the sixties. The second period lasted through the seventies until the early eighties. Humanities scholars learned how to write their own programs, as programming languages became easier to master. But more significantly the development and widespread availability of pre-designed packages, such as OCP (the Oxford Concordance Package) for concordance construction, and SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for statistical analysis, meant that it was possible for the humanist to become more independent of the computing experts, and to operate with at most low-level assistance. In history, in particular, the use of computers to provide material for use in monographs, once a matter to be trumpeted in the text, became a commonplace to be noted without elaboration in footnotes. Humanities computing centres were set up in Oxford, Liege, Tubingen and other places. While the availability of systems such as SPSS meant that there was a temptation for humanists to fit their special data to the software, rather than to design software for the data, on the other hand there began to be developed systems for source-oriented data entry, of which the most famous was CLIO. Throughout the seventies and the early eighties, humanities scholars, despite their growing independence, still worked in collaboration with, and usually in proximity to, their colleagues in computing centres. With the advent of cheap microcomputers in the mid-eighties, the typical humanities scholar was more likely to be found doing research at home on a personal computer, attached no doubt to a network, but engaged much less interactively with colleagues in the computing centre. As a result of the microcomputer revolution, electronic data processing has become a familiar feature of research in most humanities disciplines. Nowadays, I am told, in Germany most doctoral students in history make use of computers, not just for word processing, at some stage of their studies. No doubt this will shortly be the case, where it is not so already, in other European countries. The building of large databases, whether unstructured (like text-archives) or structured (like many historical databases) has been a major preoccupation of this period. The development of CD-ROM techniques has been of particular significance for students of texts: classics students can search the complete database of ancient literature by using the IBYCUS implementation of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae; students of English can use the CD-ROM version of the Oxford English Dictionary to conduct searches which would take lifetimes if conducted on the twenty volumes of hard copy. In archaeology, I understand, it can now be said that computers are automatically considered for any project, however small. Throughout these stages of development, the research conducted by humanities scholars has taken place at three levels. The lowest, most general, and most unambiguously useful level consists in the employment of a computer to perform a humdrum task in less time than would be possible for an unaided human: the search through a text for a quotation, the determination of a word frequency, the construction and analysis of a contingency table, the classification of iconic data. This kind of activity will leave little visible trace in the published work of the researcher. At the other end of the scale there are ambitious research projects undertaken for methodical demonstration purposes. The results are sought not so much to enrich the domain of research with fundamentally new findings as to demonstrate the validity of some new form of automatic processing. Two examples of such projects are discussed in a recent paper by Manfred Thaller. In France Gian Piero Zarri has developed a system known as RESEDA to allow Artificial Intelligence techniques to be applied to historical source material (concerning the Hundred Years War). The project is well known in AI circles; but it seems to have left virtually no trace in the historical literature. This is because the system is so complicated that no historian could use it without explicit support from the AI project group. Again, in 1981–7 the Volkswagenstiftung funded on a large scale the ARCOS project, a system which photographs a three-dimensional archaeological object, provides a drawing and converts it into data which lend themselves easily to methods like Cluster Analysis. The prototype was in the vanguard of technical development. Unfortunately the price of the prototype was so high that it was out of the financial reach of the archaeological community. Projects of this kind win reclaim in the literature of AI, but pass almost without remark in the parent humanities disciplines such as history and archaeology. Where, in fact, are we to look for the major effects of the use of computers in humanities research? The most spectacular is the creation of the whole new topic of research, the new discipline of computational linguistics. The most widely felt effect has been the perfecting of traditional tools of research, data-collections, concordances, dictionaries, and corpora. New tools of research, and new testbeds for theories become possible. Perhaps the most dramatic opportunity being developed for linguistic studies is the British National Corpus. This is a collaborative venture, involving three publishers (OUP, Longman, Chambers), the British Library, and two universities (Oxford and Lancaster). The aim is to provide a corpus of 100 million words of contemporary spoken and written English to provide raw data for the empirical study of language by a wide variety of disciplines. The project started in January 1991 with a grant from the DTI and the SERC. When complete it should provide an unparalleled resource for lexicographers, and information technologists, and a test-bed for theoretical linguists. But in spite of the multiplication of new basic research tools in the humanities, it is surprisingly difficult to point, in specific areas, to solid, uncontroverted gains to scholarship which could not have been achieved without the new technology. The high hopes which some computer enthusiasts held out that the computer would revolutionise humanistic study have been proved, over and over again, to be unrealistic. Sometimes the initial claims made were much exaggerated: as the claim made in New Testament studies that the computer would for the first time reveal the true lineaments of the Bible that we had ignorantly worshipped. But even in areas where there was no hubris in the initial claims, the results delivered have often been disappointing. Between humdrum research and showpiece research, what the humanities scholarly community is really anxious to see is work which is both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer. In the last three decades the number of such contributions is sadly small. No doubt in each discipline my colleagues could single out a handful of seminal projects. What I want to do, in this second part of my lecture, is to illustrate in the field in which I have been myself involved — literature and stylistics — the kind of projects which have been attempted and the limited success which has been achieved. From the outset, some scholars have been highly suspicious of the use of numerical methods in literary studies. This suspicion is particularly strong among biblical scholars, and one of them, Principal T.M. Knox, said more than twenty years ago ‘The spirit moveth where it listeth and is not to be reduced to the numerical terms with which alone a computer can cope’. But such hostility to numerical methods seems irrational, and often inconsistent. Biblical scholars have long noticed, and based arguments on, the occurrence of hapax legomena, or words which occur once only in a given text or author. But if one is to allow counting at all in a literary context, it seems perverse to insist that counting should stop at the number one and go no further. Since long before the invention of computers, students of literary texts have made extensive use of concordances. Concordances are often more helpful than dictionaries for determining the precise sense of a word in an author's vocabulary, and they enable favourite phrases and tricks of style to be identified and catalogued. To make a concordance of a lengthy text by hand calls for months or years of tedious labour. With the aid of a computer, concordances of many kinds can be made with comparatively little difficulty. Students of literature who used concordance packages on mainframes commonly asked the computer to produce for them a complete print-out of their chosen concordance, and then took it home to consult in the traditional manner, turning the pages of a sheaf of paper. Producing several hundred pages of hard copy with a desk-top computer and printer would be a long and tedious business. It is much more common now to use the facilities provided by a package such as micro-OCP to generate a particular concordance entry on the screen of a PC directly from the text-base whenever it is needed. Thus, if you want to study the use of the word ‘true’ in Arthur Hugh Clough, rather than generate a massive concordance containing all the words in Clough's poems, and then leafing through it to find the word ‘true’, you use the concordance package commands to generate a concordance which contains all and only the uses of ‘true’. You then consult that on the screen and print it out only if you think you are going to want to look up the same word again. Concordances produced by computer may differ from traditional hand-made concordances in several ways. One is that they will be much more complete: they will contain all the tiny function words which were too frequent, and regarded as too unimportant, to figure in a work like Cruden's Concordance to the Scriptures. More interestingly, the items which provide the focus to the concordance need not be dictionary headings or even vocabulary words at all. A particular grammatical feature, rather than a particular lexical item, may provide the focus of the concordance; thus, you may look up, in a Virgil concordance, not the occurrences of ‘bellum’, but the occurrences of the second declension neuter singular nominative noun. Concordances of this kind to the New Testament have been produced on the basis of the Analytical New Testament compiled by Barbara and Timothy Friberg (Baker Books, 1981). What is the literary scholar to do with all the information to be found in the concordances and word-lists generated by the new technology? Much of the material will no doubt be exploited in all kinds of traditional ways, for the study of meaning, style, and language history. But the computer also facilitates one particular type of study of texts: the study of their quantifiable features by statistical methods. The statistical study of style is a discipline which is still in its infancy, but has recently been showing signs of vigorous growth. It is often called ‘stylometry’. Stylometric studies may be undertaken for many different reasons. One may wish to study the statistics of word usage or word order with a view to understanding a text better, to catch nuances of meaning and perhaps to render them into a different language. Or one may be interested in the history of the development of a language, and study the speech habits of particular authors as an indication of linguistic change. Or one may hope to use the quantifiable features of a text as an indication of the authorship of a text when this is in question. Authorship attribution studies of this kind have caught the public eye rather more than other types of stylometric inquiry. It is sometimes claimed that stylometry enables the scholar to identify the fingerprint of an author, a stylistic criterion, or set of criteria, which can be used to determine with certainty questions of disputed authorship. Such claims seem exaggerated, on the basis of the evidence presented hitherto; but there is no doubt that stylometry can offer valuable evidence of a novel kind which, taken in conjunction with more traditional evidence, can often throw new light on ancient problems. The study of hapax legomena formed the basis of one of the earliest sophisticated statistical studies of the Bible, that of K. Grayston and G. Herdan in 1960, who, building on work of P.N. Harrison in the nineteen twenties, argued that the Pastoral Epistles could not be the authentic work of the Apostle Paul. Probably the best known stylometric work on the New Testament is that of A.Q. Morton. Morton, in collaboration with others, has argued, from 1966 to the present time, that in the Pauline corpus only Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians form a homogeneous group which can be attributed to a single hand. Morton's arguments were based on a study of sentence lengths, on the frequencies of common words, and on other grammatical features such as the proportion of different parts of speech. My own investigations into the NT, based on the full data provided by the Friberg Analytical NT, came to much less dramatic conclusions than Morton. I addressed first two ancient problems: the relationship between Luke and Acts (I found that Acts resembled Luke more than it resembled any other book of the NT) and the relationship between the Apocalypse and the Gospel of St John (I found that they differed from each other more than any other two books of the NT). On the more difficult topic of the Pauline corpus I concluded that the evidence was equally compatible with a widely differing set of authors or a single unusually versatile author, but that it did not support the view that four epistles stood out as uniform by comparison with all others. The use of stylometry in authorship attribution studies depends on the hypothesis that there are quantifiable features of style which are characteristic of particular authors. Ideally, a stylometric test of authorship should be a feature which is characteristic of all the known works of a particular author and which is unique to his works. Features which are to be found in all, and only, the works of a particular author turn out to be frustratingly difficult to come by. Authorship attribution problems are easier to deal with when they can be cast into the following form: in respect of the measured features, does the doubtful work resemble the work of candidate author A more than it resembles the work of candidate author B? A classic example of this kind of study was the work of the Harvard statisticians Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace on the Federalist Papers. These papers were a series of articles published in 1787 and 1788 to persuade the citizens of New York to ratify the U.S. Constitution; most of the papers were known to have been written by Hamilton or by Madison, but the authorship of twelve of them was disputed. By comparing the rate of occurrence of particular words in the disputed papers with the rates in known Hamilton papers, and rates in known Madison papers, the authors were able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Madison wrote the disputed papers. A partly similar problem is presented by the Aristotelian corpus, which contains two ethical treatises of parallel structure, the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics. The problem here is not one of authorship attribution, since most scholars regard them both as genuinely Aristotelian; the puzzle is that three books make a double appearance in the manuscript tradition, once as books five, six and seven of the Nicomachean Ethics, once as books four, five and six of the Eudemian Ethics. In 1978 I published a study (The Aristotelian Ethics) in which I argued, on the basis of twenty-four independent tests based on 60% of the word usage in the text, that the disputed books resembled the Eudemian context rather than the Nicomachean one. Similar problems have been studied by similar methods in the very different context of the law-courts. It is sometimes a question whether a particular confession is the unaided work of an accused or is a fabrication of a police officer. A.Q. Morton, in his book Literary Detection records how stylometric evidence was admitted in such a case in 1974. The Californian court trying Patricia Hearst for bank robbery was asked to hear stylometric evidence to help determine whether she composed the propaganda for the Symbionese Liberation Army which was part of the case against her. The trial judge refused the evidence on the grounds of ‘the relative infancy of this area of scientific endeavour’. But anyone working in this field will receive from time to time invitations to offer evidence as an expert witness in such cases. In recent years many authorship attribution problems, in a variety of languages, have been tackled, with varying degrees of success, by stylometric methods. Thus Thomas Merriam has used these methods to try to show that Sir Thomas More is the genuine work of Shakespeare, and it was partly on stylometric grounds that the poem ‘Shall I die?’ won its place in the Oxford Shakespeare. Y. Radday has used Hebrew stylometry to address the problem of the unity of Isaiah and to argue against the standard critical theory which sees the book of Genesis as woven from three disparate strands of tradition. In spite of the proliferation of stylometric authorship studies, it would be wrong to think that attribution is the only goal for statistical studies of style. One of the most interesting recent works is J.F. Burrows' Computation into Criticism. This is a study of Jane Austen's novels based on common prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and the like. ‘It is a truth not generally acknowledged’ Burrows points out ‘that in most discussions of works of English fiction, we proceed as if a third of our material were not really there.’ Burrows shows how Jane Austen makes skilful use of the common words to build up different idiolects for the different persons in the novels to bring out the differences in their characters. Admiral Croft, for instance, uses ‘we’ and its cases more than ten times as frequently as Lady Catherine de Burgh. It is by tiny touches such as these — though only a stylometrist would consciously notice them — that Jane Austen builds up the picture of one character's clubbability, and the other's insolence of rank. Computer-assisted studies of style have often attempted to settle questions of chronology in the work of authors whose works are undated. Leonard Brandwood has worked for many decades on the chronology of Plato's dialogues. One of the most recent contributions to this debate has been that of Gerland Ledger, in his book Recounting Plato. Ledger took the simplest possible feature of language — the occurrence of particular letters of the alphabet — and by subjecting this to a complicated multivariate analysis he came closer than many previous workers to identifying particular authors and even works. He drew new conclusions about the authenticity of the dubious dialogues, and the chronology of the entire corpus. In the study of literature, quantitative methods can never achieve the primacy which they enjoy in the experimental sciences and in many branches of social studies. But scholars who use them with a sober sense of their limitations can add a new dimension to literary studies, and in an age of divided cultures we should surely be ready to welcome a marriage of literacy and numeracy. However, of the studies I have mentioned it would be difficult to claim that more than a handful fulfilled the criteria I mentioned earlier: both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer. Indeed throughout humanities disciplines, after thirty-odd years of this kind of research, there are embarrassingly few books and articles which can be confidently pointed out as passing both tests. This has meant that many enthusiasts for computing in the humanities have an uncomfortable sense of crisis, a feeling of promise unfulfilled. Gone is the glad confident morning in which Ladurie could say ‘L'historien de demain sera programmeur ou il ne sera plus’. The feeling of disillusion is indeed partly the result of the misplaced optimism and exaggerated claims of some of the pioneers: the belief was sometimes encouraged in the past that feeding data into a computer would automatically solve a scholar's problems. Rare has been the computer project which did not, in the course of execution, bring to light an initial overestimation of the technical possibilities, and an underestimation of the problems of data preparation. The proliferation of personal computers in the last decade has often, embarrassingly, gone with an actual diminution in methodological sophistication. If the fruits of computing in the humanities are less abundant than one might have hoped, there are also disadvantages of the introduction of computers which are becoming all too obvious. Let me mention six, which I will call: redundancy of people, redundancy of effort, diversion of effort, diversion of funding, distortion of research and transfer of population. 1) Redundancy of people. Alexander Cruden spent the best years of his life preparing his concordance to the Bible. There is no longer any need for dedicated Crudens to make concordances. Classical scholars among us will all, as students, have stood in awe of our seniors who, given a rare Greek word, could pluck out of their memories the ten contexts in different classical authors in which it was used. Nowadays any student can discover that information in moments with the aid of IBYCUS. It is no longer possible to found a reputation for scholarship on being good at spotting allusions. This problem is the humanistic analogue of the problem of the stoker on the electric train. It is not a serious one for the discipline, nor even in human terms does it compare with the undesirable side-effects of technological innovations in practical life and scientific research. 2) Redundancy of effort. Scholars who are good at knowing where to look for the sources of their subject matter may not be good at knowing where to look for suitable software. The replacement of mainframe use by desktop computing in recent years means that scholars working alone do not have as much contact with computer-learned people as they used to do. This means they are less in touch with software developments. Hence, if they get interested in designing their own software, scholars may spend their time reinventing last year's wheel. 3) Diversion of effort. Even if the software designed is genuinely original and useful, there is a danger that scholars become hooked on the production of software. There is a risk that a scholar whose talents and academic position call for historical and critical work will spend most of his or her working time as a programmer. 4) Diversion of funding. Because there is pressure on departments in humanistic subjects to appear up to date and efficient, it is much easier to persuade funding bodies to give money for computers and software than to buy manuscripts, rare books, or second and third copies of frequently used library texts. After a few years a department may be left with serious gaps in its library and a load of superannuated computing equipment. 5) Distortion of research. There is a danger that projects may be undertaken not because they are likely to lead to academically interesting results, but simply because they are susceptible to computerisation. Scholars feel the need to show they have used the latest technology, even if electronic methods are not the appropriate one. But in the words of Manfred Thaller it is important for humanists to adapt the software to the scholarship, not the scholarship to the software. 6) Transfer of populations. Professor Connor, in a fascinating paper on computers in classical studies, claims that computers came just at the wrong time, at a time when scholar's interests were moving from textual studies to critical theory, women's studies and the like. He says: ‘Computer technology became available precisely at the wrong moment in the profession's development. The era of traditional lexical and textual studies had largely passed… The energy of North American classicists, by and large, has concentrated on interpretive questions and on the writing of essays and monographs of social themes, cultural history and literary criticism… The questions posed by Feminist, Marxist, Structuralist and Post-Structuralist criticism have not lent themselves to computer-based responses.’ Is this just a malign coincidence? One may well speculate on possible causes for the phenomenon. One does not need to draw exaggerated conclusions from the differences between the left and right hand sides of the brain in order to accept that humanists and scientists may be different kinds of people. Those whose gifts and tastes lie in a certain direction — people who do not have a head for mathematics — may well have been influenced by this in an early career choice. To their dismay they see quantification invading their own subject: they might as well have become physicists or engineers if English literature, Greek history and even New Testament theology now offer no escape from those wretched numbers. So now the more abstract, intuitive, and ideological branches of the humanities become more attractive. The number of practitioners in these areas grows — largely, no doubt, through the genuine fascination of their subjects, but swollen perhaps with an influx of refugees from the relentless advance of technological rigour. There are still, thank God, a few areas where one can work without either having to use computers or feeling guilty because one does not. If this is a correct analysis of the situation, the consequences for our disciplines may be far-reaching in unexpected ways which are only just beginning to be noticed. I would like to end by asking what lessons can be drawn from the successes and the disappointments of recent decades. No doubt there are many, but I would like to single out just three. The first is that it is important never to lose sight of the fact that a computer is an assistant to, not a substitute for, a human researcher. Neglect of this obvious truth led to computer programs (say, for language analysis) being regarded as failures if they could not record 100% success. More recently, we have learnt to become grateful for robust programs which will do 95% of the work and leave the human being to make the decisive intervention in the other 5% of cases. A second lesson is that even when the computerization of a research project fails because of the intractability of a particular set of data, it can be an intellectually instructive task to try, and fail, to prepare the data in a formalized manner. And the successful formalization of data can open up questions for research, and types of evidence, which would not have occurred to the research community without the effort to present the data in computer-friendly form. The third lesson is that it will not be possible for humanists to take full stock of what the computer has to offer to their disciplines until the study of statistics becomes a normal and inescapable part of the training of those who plan an academic career in the humanities. This needs to be recognized not only at university level (as in France, where now a course of statistics is an essential part of the training of an academic historian) but also in any high school which has an interest in sending on students to do university work in the humanities. There is still a great lack, in every language, of good textbooks designed to teach statistics outside the context of the natural and social sciences. Apart from strictly academic consideration, the ordinary citizen of any modern democracy will find an elementary course in statistics of more general educational value than courses in e.g. differential calculus, which are more popular in science-oriented schools. One of the unquestionable advantages of the growing use of computers by humanists is that it has done something to bridge the divide between two cultures — scientific and humanist — which many writers have lamented as threatening to fragment the community of scholars and the republic of learning. A by-product of the computer revolution has been an increased understanding by scientists and humanists of each others' methods and preoccupations. Surprisingly, in the last decades is that literary studies, perhaps especially classical studies, which may seem to be at the other extreme of the academic spectrum from the sciences, have shown themselves more self confident in the use of computers than history has done, even though history is closer to the social sciences which have for long been acclimatized to quantification and computerization. On the other hand, the flight in some literature departments from traditional methods of study, with their emphasis on the detailed analysis of texts, towards theory-laden forms of criticism with an explicit political agenda, is a development which is not favourable to the search for objectively quantifiable features capable of computerized study. What will the next decades hold? Will it be seen, with hindsight, that the introduction of the computer into the humanities disciplines has made no more substantial change in the eventual output of research than was made by the introduction of the electric typewriter? Or will there be a flowering of research papers, neither pedestrian nor spectacular, containing solid and original results obtained by techniques for which the computer is indispensable? It is hard to make a confident prediction. But the testing time has now arrived; because for the first time posts of leadership in humanities departments are being taken up by a generation of scholars who have been familiar with the computer from their earliest schooldays, scholars who are neither frightened by, nor over-respectful of, the new powers which the computer has brought.

ACA ACA-FT1-001 -0.38 "Editorials ACE inhibitors after myocardial infarction May benefit patients with left ventricular dysfunction Studies in animals and humans have shown that giving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction reduces left ventricular remodelling, and this effect has been linked to benefits in clinical outcome. The recently published results of three large randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials focus on the effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and morbidity caused by ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction. Ventricular remodelling comprises infarct expansion and global ventricular dilatation. Infarct expansion, or thinning and lengthening of the infarcted myocardium, is seen within hours after myocardial necrosis and is usually complete within three weeks after infarction. Global ventricular dilatation, which results from a progressive increase in myocyte length with sarcomere recruitment and resulting hypertrophy of the non-infarcted myocardium, continues for a long time. Infarct expansion may result in cardiac rupture, aneurysm, and thrombus formation. Global ventricular dilatation results in progressive increase in the volume of the ventricular cavity, which is a powerful predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction and a recognised precursor of symptomatic heart failure. In the SAVE (survival and ventricular enlargement) and the SOLVD (studies of left ventricular dysfunction) prevention trials an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was given to patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction with the aim of reducing mortality and the incidence of heart failure. The SAVE trial enrolled 2231 patients who had suffered myocardial infarction, had ejection fractions equal to or less than 40%, and had no symptoms of heart failure. The mean time after myocardial infarction to treatment was 11 days. The SOLVD prevention study included 4220 patients, nearly 80% of whom had history of myocardial infarction, with ejection fractions equal to or less than 35%. Entry into this trial (as opposed to the SOLVD treatment trial) required that the patient had no symptoms and was taking no treatment for heart failure. These patients were randomly assigned to placebo or captopril (SAVE) or enalapril (SOLVD prevention). The mean follow up was 42 and 37.4 months respectively. In the CONSENSUS II (cooperative north Scandinavian enalapril survival study II) an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was given within 24 hours of myocardial infarction in addition to standard treatment and irrespective of baseline ventricular function (though patients with clinical evidence of heart failure at the time of entry into the study were excluded). This trial had the potential for identifying a distinct effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the early, infarct expansion, phase of remodelling. It enrolled 6090 patients and assigned them to enalapril or placebo. The mean time to treatment was 15 hours. Interim analysis showed no reduction in mortality and an increased incidence of hypotension in the enalapril group, so the trial was discontinued. The follow up varied from 41 to 180 days, and because the trial was stopped only 48% of the patients were followed up for six months. In the SAVE study all cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly reduced in the captopril group, by 19% and 21% respectively. A reduction in the incidence of progressive heart failure was primarily responsible for the reduced mortality. In the SOLVD prevention trial trends toward reduction in all cause and cardiovascular mortality in the enalapril group did not reach statistical significance. In CONSENSUS II there was no significant reduction in all cause and cardiovascular mortality with treatment. The lack of survival benefit was consistent in all predefined subgroups (anterior myocardial infarction, age over 70 years, and concomitant baseline treatment). In the SAVE and SOLVD prevention trials development of symptomatic heart failure, progression of heart failure, rate of admission with heart failure, and incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction were all reduced in the treatment group. In the CONSENSUS II study there was no significant reduction in any of these end points, although the rate of change of treatment due to worsening heart failure was significantly reduced in the treatment group. Why did the SOLVD prevention and CONSENSUS II trials show no apparent benefit on mortality? In the SOLVD prevention study nearly 19% of the placebo group received open label treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors during follow up and this crossover may have resulted in underestimation of survival benefit. In addition, patients entering this study were more likely to have had no symptoms of heart failure than those in the SAVE study, in which treatment for heart failure was permitted. The apparent lack of benefit of early angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in the CONSENSUS II trial may have been related to the design or to theoretical issues. Patients with non-Q wave, inferior, and previous myocardial infarction have a reduced risk of infarct expansion. Thrombolytic agents might reduce the stimulus to remodelling by  limiting infarct size and augmenting blood flow to additional jeopardised zones. Moreover, since the use of thrombolytic agents and aspirin in patients with myocardial infarction improves short and long term survival we would expect to have to give any additional treatment for a longer period to a larger number of patients to show a further reduction in mortality. On the other hand, an adverse influence of giving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors early after myocardial infarction might result from systemic or direct myocardial effects of these agents. Systemic hypotension may reduce coronary perfusion; in the CONSENSUS II trial there was an increased incidence of first dose hypotension in the enalapril group (10.5% v 2.5% in placebo group) and mortality was increased in patients who showed this effect. Myocardial angiotensin II increases the rate of myocardial protein synthesis, promotes growth of myocytes, and promotes collagen expression by fibroblasts, and large increases in angiotensin converting enzyme activity are found in the scar tissue after myocardial necrosis. In the short term these effects may serve to maintain cardiac structural integrity and normalise cardiac performance, in part by augmenting chamber compliance. Thus angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may actually worsen clinical outcome by inhibiting an early protective effect of angiotensin II on cardiac structure. Do the data from the CONSENSUS II study provide conclusive proof that giving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor early produces no survival benefit? The findings certainly highlight the risk of hypotension; elderly people and patients with inferior myocardial infarction have a greater propensity for this complication. On the other hand, an echocardiographic substudy showed that the increase in ventricular volume was significantly reduced in the six months after myocardial infarction, presumably because of attenuation of remodelling — as supported by the data from the SOLVD prevention and the SAVE studies. The factors that could potentially have been influenced by early angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment are infarct size and expansion, and we have no specific data on these. Indeed, the effect of early treatment on infarct size and expansion may be seen only in subgroups of patients, and future studies should be directed at identifying such groups. Though many issues remain to be resolved, data from the SOLVD prevention and SAVE trials provide compelling evidence that patients recovering from myocardial infarction with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction equal to or less than 40%) benefit from long term administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. While routine, early administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors cannot presently be recommended in patients with acute myocardial infarction, this strategy needs further evaluation in high risk subgroups, especially patients with large, first anteroapical infarction. The thrifty genotype in non-insulin dependent diabetes The hypothesis survives In 1962 Neel proposed that the persistence of diabetes mellitus must mean that the diabetic genotype holds some survival advantage. Two decades later, after the clearer recognition of the distinction between insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, Neel modified his hypothesis so that it related specifically to non-insulin dependent diabetes. Despite some scepticism, the ‘thrifty genotype’ remains a convenient explanation for the extremely high incidence of non-insulin dependent diabetes that develops in many populations which have experienced rapid socioeconomic modernisation during this century. The thrifty genotype is thought to have offered a survival advantage to individuals in hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies, who were subject to periods of nutritional hardship, by favouring fat deposition during periods when food was abundant. In modern times, when physical activity has decreased and calories are in constant supply (usually in an energy dense form high in fat and simple carbohydrates), the genotype has become disadvantageous and favours the development of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Central to the need for the thrifty genotype hypothesis is the assumption that, when expressed, non-insulin dependent diabetes was associated with diminished fertility (at least before the advent of modern medicine). Certainly, a reproductive handicap has recently been shown in young Nauruan women with early onset non-insulin dependent diabetes. Whether or not humans with a thrifty genotype did in the past (or continue to) better survive periods of famine has not been directly proved. This assumption rests largely on the observation of high susceptibility to non-insulin dependent diabetes in populations known historically to have experienced such episodes. North American Indians, Polynesian and Micronesian Pacific islanders, Australian Aborigines, and Asian Indians are usually considered in these terms, but it is not known whether all human populations previously subject to severe ‘feast and famine’ conditions have a thrifty genotype. Recently some migrant African and Chinese populations have also been found to be susceptible to non-insulin dependent diabetes, and people of European origin might be the only true ‘low susceptibility’ group. As Weatherall suggested in his 1992 Harveian oration, this implies either that the positive selective forces favouring the thrifty genotype were not as strong in Europeans or that the negative selective forces of a sedentary, well nourished lifestyle have operated for sufficiently long to diminish the frequency of the genotype. Whatever the case, non-insulin dependent diabetes in Europeans tends to occur in middle or older age, after completion of the reproductive phase in women, and contrasts with the early age of onset and severity of the disease observed in populations such as Nauruans. Experimental support for the thrifty genotype comes from work in rodents showing that strains susceptible to obesity and diabetes have lower metabolic rates, defective thermoregulatory mechanisms, and an enhanced ability to store food as fat and to survive prolonged fasting. Prospective studies in Pima Indians indicate that ‘thrifty’ lower metabolic rates in humans may favour weight gain. The metabolic expression of the thrifty genotype favouring non-insulin dependent diabetes would appear to be via selective tissue insulin resistance and relatively high basal and stimulated insulin concentrations. Under modern conditions these promote obesity and a vicious cycle of increasing insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, leading ultimately to pancreatic β cell decompensation and frank diabetes. Adapting data from known insulin resistant states such as obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes, O'Dea has recently theorised on the nature of metabolic adaptations which might have favoured survival in Australian Aborigines in the context of their traditional hunter-gatherer diet, where ‘feasts’ on wild animals such as kangaroos were characteristically high in protein and relatively low in fat and carbohydrate. In this case, selective insulin resistance in liver would promote conversion of dietary protein to glucose and fat via active hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is not sensitive to insulin suppression, and lipogenesis, which is insulin sensitive. Meanwhile, fat accumulation would be encouraged by insulin sensitive adipose tissue and the relative resistance to glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. This concept of selective insulin resistance is not new and has been well demonstrated in animal models. In a recent publication Wendorf and Goldfine have related apparent variation in susceptibility to non-insulin dependent diabetes among North American Indian tribes to the timing of migrations into the continent. They have hypothesised that a ‘thrifty genotype’ may have been selected around 10000–11000 years ago in a subgroup of ancestral Indians with a particular reliance on vanishing big game species such as mammoths. While difficult to prove, the development of such hypotheses at least indicates that researchers are attempting to justify reliance on the thrifty genotype to explain variation in non-insulin dependent diabetes frequency. In Pima Indians a considerable body of work favours a selective insulin resistance in muscle as the metabolic expression of the thrifty genotype. This includes the demonstration that insulin action appears to aggregate in families and that its distribution is compatible with a single gene codominant mode of inheritance. None the less, except for specific mutations to key enzymes in rare syndromes of familial diabetes and the recently identified link between some kindreds of maturity onset diabetes of the young and mutations to the glucokinase gene in liver and β cells, the gene(s) causing the bulk of cases of non-insulin dependent diabetes remain obscure. While a single defect may be responsible in small unique populations such as Pima Indians and Nauruans, in larger high prevalence populations a polygenic causation is most likely. It would be too much to expect convergent evolution to have produced a single thrifty genotype in all populations by chance, and the most likely situation is that several genes have been selected in different combinations, in different populations, to produce a phenotypically similar syndrome. The search for the genes responsible for non-insulin dependent diabetes continues and may one day offer the option of high risk or even general population screening, and perhaps specific gene manipulation therapies. However, even now the epidemiological evidence for the disadvantages of a sedentary lifestyle and Western diet in causing current epidemics of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes in the developing world provides a compelling basis for promoting primary prevention of these diseases. Certainly, preventive strategies and modern medicine will tend to counteract negative selective forces and will maintain the frequency of the thrifty genotype in human populations, but, as Neel soberly pointed out, ‘efforts to preserve the diabetes genotype through this transient period of plenty are in the interests of mankind,’ for some time in the future we may again be glad to have it. Deprivation payments Still awaiting change Deprivation payments were introduced with the 1990 general practitioner contract with the intention of putting more resources into practices where deprivation might be expected to increase the demand for services. Laudable though the aim might be, the results have been much criticised. Arguments over using the ‘Jarman index’ to assess demand for services and the method of payment have obscured the principle underlying the payments. This was that a proportion of the pool funding for General Medical Services would be redirected to practices in high demand, deprived areas. Using scores derived from the Jarman underprivileged area index for this purpose seems to have face validity — the index was developed from a survey of one in 10 British general practitioners who were asked to weight social factors according to how much they thought they increased workload. Using census data, scores were derived for areas of the country either on the basis of ward or enumerator district (with average populations of 5327 and 450 respectively) and extra money is provided to practices with a higher proportion of factors perceived by a representative sample of doctors to equate to high patient demand. Critics have argued that no evidence exists that Jarman's weighted factors actually create extra workload; indeed, some state that doctors in high scoring areas may actually work fewer hours. Such arguments are themselves spurious since general practitioners are able to ration their workload despite potential demand by controlling access through measures such as rapid consultations, short surgery hours, or other barriers to visits. They can thereby create patient expectation of the level of demand that will be serviced. The actual workload of doctors does not necessarily reflect accurately the potential demand for their services, as unmet need is not taken into account. Calculating any extra resource using an index based on doctors' own perceptions of what creates work seems the more valid approach as these will presumably be factors deterring doctors from working in underprivileged areas or causing them to limit access so as to avoid overwork. Despite almost a decade of critical review and the existence of alternative formulas for identifying deprivation the Jarman index remains as good an indicator of potential demand for general practitioner services as exists. Major problems, however, arise over its application. Census data are used to calculate the scores, but these may be as much as 12 years out of date(current data were collected in 1981; scores based on the 1991 census are expected later this year). Averaging scores to a ward can exclude payments to practices in deprived parts of otherwise affluent wards and put unnecessary resources into practices in pleasant parts of underprivileged wards. Graduating payments and particularly the high score needed to trigger any payment are problems. Most important is this extra income might not result in any attempt to improve care. The Department of Health has talked about refining elements of the general practitioner contract. Basing the deprivation payments on the Jarman index still seems the best option, although it is time the Department of Health supported research into its validation. Such studies should focus on the workload in comparable practices — for example, practices in high and low deprivation areas with similar levels of commitment. Considerable fine tuning of the eligibility criteria is needed. Payments could be limited to a maximum number of patients per general practitioner which would stop the protests that a single handed general practitioner with a list of 3000 in an area of high deprivation receives an extra £28 800 a year without any obligation to provide extra services. That maximum should be as low as 1300 to 1500 patients per full time principal. Perhaps the most important function of deprivation payments was to compensate practices with low lists after the introduction of the new contract, which linked income much more closely to capitation. The payments should not encourage high lists in areas of deprivation. Eligibility according to ward is a further problem that using enumeration districts would partially overcome, although a much greater margin of error (approaching 50%) comes from converting patient postcodes to enumeration districts than to wards. Perhaps some of the total expenditure on deprivation payments could be reserved by the family health services authorities for appeals, providing that the money was ‘ring fenced.’ Authorities could, within clear guidelines, make discretionary payments — for example, to practices on the boundaries of ‘deprived’ wards who could show that they would receive payment if enumeration districts were used. Similarly, practices could appeal if they had evidence that the population characteristics had altered substantially since the last census. Furthermore, it could be possible to update locally certain factors in the Jarman index more regularly, especially unemployment rates, which change so rapidly. Lowering of the entry point for payment from the 30 point on the Jarman scale — Jarman has suggested that 16 is more appropriate — and the use of more payment bands might be considered. This would increase the proportion of patients attracting some deprivation payment to their practice from the current 9% to about 20% of the population. Current total spending on deprivation payments could be maintained despite increasing the eligibility for payments if the average per capita fee was lowered. Spreading the benefits too thinly, however, might undermine the viability of the most needy practices. An important priority is to ensure that extra income is spent on extra activity. Limiting maximum eligible patients per doctor would help, as would requiring some broad declaration by the practice as to how the sum would be spent (such as will occur with the revised health promotion payments). Practices receiving substantial payments should be expected to employ sufficient ancillary staff — for example, nearer two full time equivalent staff per doctor rather than the one to one ratio so often seen. Pressure could also be exerted on practices to adopt 10 minute consultation bookings, given the relation between length of consultation and quality of performance. It is, however, difficult to see how ambitious practice aims could be realised from payments made and therefore subject to change on a quarterly basis. We need to canvas opinion and collect data from innovative practices in deprived areas to find out how payments have been best used to support their greater patient demand. Clearly without the deprivation payments some good inner city practices would have been bankrupted by the new contract. Unfortunately, because of anomalies in the system, the needs of other deserving practices are still not being met. Improving London's health service Now comes the hard part After a century's diagnosis of the ills of London's health service many in Britain will welcome almost any prescription that stops 15% of the population consuming 20% of NHS resources. But for those living and working in London the decisions made last week by the government (see p 537) have to face a harder test. Will they improve or worsen the standard of care given to Londoners — and to a wider group of patients who use London's specialist services and benefit from its research and teaching? Many people have been disappointed that last week's decisions were not more precise — defining, for example, exactly what should happen to St Bartholomew's or Charing Cross Hospital. But London's pattern of hospitals is such a historical muddle that no one can wave a wand and transform everything overnight. Restructuring will inevitably entail compromises, and it is important that those who have to make the compromises work should be involved in fashioning them. In general Mrs Bottomley has set clear boundaries and timetables for the decisions and told the relevant authorities to work out their own salvation within them. In return she should ensure that her mechanisms for protecting research and education are robust enough to enable London's hospitals to operate fairly within the internal market. The boundaries make sense, but there is an air of indecent haste about the timetables. Even though many of Sir Bernard Tomlinson's recommendations, now endorsed by the government, worked with the grain of changes already occurring, some of the timetables are short. The specialty reviews, for example, have to assess current and projected needs, define criteria for tertiary services, and advise on the most cost effective and clinically effective locations — all by the end of May. This work will not be done in a vacuum, but for a problem that has existed for at least a lifetime a few more months of thought might lead to better outcomes, and ones that will be more readily accepted. Likewise, the agent of change might have been better devised to give more confidence in the outcome. At present the London Implementation Group smells too much of hole in the corner deals: the working part of the group consists only of two named people, one of them a former Thames regional chairman, and the ordinary members of the specialty review committees (see p 589) and of the all important Primary Health Care Forum had not yet been announced as we went to press. The group might knock heads together but it doesn't seem designed to do the equally important job of explaining what is happening to staff and patients. And Londoners need explanations and reassurance. Over the past few months they have been told that their primary and community health care is awful; now the government tells them that accident and emergency departments will shut, along with 2000-odd hospital beds, when their immediate evidence is that it is hard to get into hospital. Likewise, the implementation group's human resources subgroup sounds too low key to convince staff that the NHS will tackle the problems of maintaining morale and preserving skills while changes go on. Part of the problem for Londoners is that the notion of transformed primary and community care, breaking down the boundaries between hospital and community, is still unclear. The government has accepted Tomlinson's recommendation for investment in premises and has set up an initiative zone to encourage new ideas. There are plenty of good ideas around, but the worry is that the sheer difficulty of practising in inner cities will overwhelm even the most enthusiastic practitioners and managers and that they will ‘settle for more of the same…but out of better buildings.’ Much will depend on the leadership and vision of the Primary Health Care Forum. Perhaps the biggest gap in both the Tomlinson report and Making London Better concerns research and postgraduate teaching. The government has already decided to bring special health authorities into the internal market. It also wants a market in research, and it promises a mechanism for funding the excess costs of academic teaching and clinical research. But there is little inkling of how the mechanism will work, and we have to wait until December for the management executive and the Department of Education to come up with ideas. They are badly needed: as Green has said, ‘It would be easy for clinical research to become the first and indeed the greatest casualty of reductions in size in London.’ This is particularly true since London has a pressing need for a shift in acute beds towards those serving elderly Londoners with multiple diseases and away from younger patients with interesting single diseases (J James, MSD Foundation symposium, 1992). London may just be carrying too big a burden of research and teaching for its population — but the means by which research and education get redistributed, rather than simply shut, remain unclear. It is easy to criticise the government's decisions: after a century of inertia, making changes in London was always going to be difficult, and Mrs Bottomley deserves credit for getting the process started. But she needs to remember that deciding strategies is easy; implementing them is hard. She has given a lot of commitment to the strategy; she now needs to give as much to the process of change and to ensuring that the public understands it. Londoners have for long been perversely proud of a health  service that does not serve them well. They now have a chance of a better one — but they need to be able to recognise that. Treating bed wetting Bladder exercises, star charts, enuresis alarms, and now ERIC Bed wetting is not the most glamorous of paediatric problems; treating it, however, can be highly rewarding because treatment is so often successful. There are an estimated 500000 sufferers aged between 6 and 16 in Britain. From reports of management within enuresis clinics it is reasonable to predict that 400000 might be curable. Nocturnal enuresis alone, particularly if primary, is both a disorder of maturation and a genetic trait. Compared with controls, patients are three to four times more likely to have a parent who had been enuretic. They are also more likely to have excessive diffuse slow background activity on electroencephalography and are significantly shorter than controls. Minor neurological dysfunction is common, including mild hypotonia, problems with coordination or fine manipulation, and mild dyskinesia. Many such ‘clumsy children’ have learning problems, emotional difficulties, and problems with relationships. These may be provoked by the lowered self esteem that many suffer as a result of teasing and criticism by peers, parents, and teachers. Within this group the wetters do even worse. Add to these handicaps serious life changes or stress, such as parental separation, and the setting is complete for the misery, embarrassment, and shame of bed wetting. Daytime and mixed day and night wetters have certain aetiological differences from night wetters, although there is much overlap: they are more likely to have had an adverse perinatal history, their bladder capacity tends to be smaller, and they are more likely to suffer urinary tract infection. It has been suggested that their urological dysfunction may be a marker of perinatal neurological damage, but in a study of 191 wetters those with dyssynergic bladders and increased residual urine were also those with the most severe behavioural problems. The most effective treatment is dry bed training and an enuresis alarm. Devlin and O'Cathain found that of 122 children consecutively referred, 22 became dry after a structured interview (with the child alone as well as with a parent), advice on personal hygiene and cleanliness training, daily bladder exercises, and provision of a ‘star chart.’ These authors supplied a further 96 children with an enuresis alarm; 81 achieved initial success (42 consecutive dry nights) at a mean of 7.3 weeks (range 1–26 weeks). Eleven required a second try, of whom nine achieved dryness. Success is more likely when the problem is maturational and less likely when there is psychiatric disorder of the child, severe family stress, absence of concern by child and parents, urological dysfunction, and developmental delay. Other poor prognostic signs may be coexisting day wetting and maternal intolerance of the enuretic child. Drugs have a minor role: tricyclic antidepressants have little effect and are not suitable to be kept in households where there is a combination of young children and stress. Oxybutynin is unhelpful except, perhaps, in children whose enuresis is part of a syndrome including frequency, urgency, dysuria, and covert bacteriuria. Desmopressin, 20–40 mg nightly intranasally is effective during treatment in 12% to 70% of cases; only up to 31% remain dry after the course of treatment. There is no long term advantage of three months' over one month's treatment. It may be of most value for occasional use, in known responders, to save embarrassment when sleeping away from home. It must not be prescribed without a careful history; if the child's real problem is not enuresis but psychogenic polydipsia, desmopressin may provoke water intoxication and hyponatraemic fits (RAF Bell et al , personal communication). Patient and parent support groups are often valuable in paediatric practice. The Enuresis Resource and Information Centre (ERIC) is a registered charity providing advice and information to children, parents, and professionals. It runs a confidential telephone counselling service and publishes material for teenagers, parents, and others. Taking a leaf from the book of other lobby groups, it is in the process of publishing guidelines on minimum standards of clinical practice and offering a consultative service to purchasers on their implementation."
ACA ACA-HRG-001 -0.38 "CHAPTER 8 Polymers in Solution 8.1 Thermodynamics of polymer solutions The interaction of long chain molecules with liquids is of considerable interest from both a practical and theoretical viewpoint. For linear and branched polymers, liquids can usually be found which will dissolve the polymer completely to form a homogeneous solution, whereas cross-linked networks will only swell when in contact with compatible liquids. In this chapter we shall deal with linear or branched polymers and treat the swelling of networks in chapter 14. When an amorphous polymer is mixed with a suitable solvent, it disperses in the solvent and behaves as though it too is a liquid. In a good solvent, classed as one which is highly compatible with the polymer, the liquid-polymer interactions expand the polymer coil, from its unperturbed dimensions, in proportion to the extent of these interactions. In a ‘poor’ solvent, the interactions are fewer and coil expansion or perturbation is restricted. The fundamental thermodynamic equation used to describe these systems relates the Gibbs free energy function G to the enthalpy H and entropy S, i.e. . A homogeneous solution is obtained when the Gibbs free energy of mixing , i.e. when the Gibbs free energy of the solution G 12 is lower than the Gibbs functions of the components of the mixture G 1 and G 2 . 8.2 Ideal mixtures of small molecules To understand the behaviour of polymers in solution more fully, a knowledge of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to ΔG M is essential, and it is instructive to consider first mixtures of small molecules, to establish some fundamental rules concerning ideal and non-ideal behaviour. Raoult's law is a useful starting point and defines an ideal solution as one in which the activity of each component in a mixture a i is equal to its mole fraction x i . This is valid only for components of comparable size, and where the intermolecular forces acting between both like and unlike molecules are equal. The latter requirement means that component molecules of each species can interchange positions without altering the total energy of the system, i.e.  and consequently it only remains for the entropy contribution ΔS M to be calculated. For a system in a given state, the entropy is related to the number of distinguishable arrangements the components in that state can adopt, and can be calculated from the  Boltzmann law , where W is the number of statistical microstates available to the system. We can begin by considering the mixing of N 1 molecules of component (1) with N 2 molecules of component (2) and this can be assumed to take place on a hypothetical lattice containing  cells of equal size. Although this formalism is not strictly necessary for the analysis, the arrangement of spherical molecules of equal size in the liquid state will, to the first near neighbour approximation, be similar to a regular lattice structure and so it is a useful structure to use as a framework for the mixing process. The total number of possible ways in which the component molecules can be arranged on the lattice increases when mixing takes place and is equal to , but as the interchanging of a molecule of (1) with another molecule (1), or (2) with (2) will be an indistinguishable process, the net number of distinguishable arrangements will be  The configurational (or combinatorial) entropy S c can then be derived from the Boltzmann law and  For large values of N i , Stirling's approximation can be used to deal with the factorials viz. In , and equation (8.3) becomes  which on dividing by N o gives  If , the mole fraction of component i, then  For the pure components,, and as ΔS M , the change in entropy on mixing, is given by  then we can write  so for a two component mixture  This expression is derived assuming (a) the volume change on mixing , (b) the molecules are all of equal size, (c) all possible arrangements have the same energy,, and (d) the motion of the components about their equilibrium positions remains unchanged on mixing . Thus the free energy of mixing, ΔG M is  which shows that mixing in ideal systems is an entropically driven, spontaneous process. 8.3 Non-ideal solutions Any deviations from assumptions (a) to (d) will constitute a deviation from ideality (an ideal solution is a rare occurrence) and several more realistic types of solution can be identified: (i) Athermal solutions; where  but ΔS M is not ideal (ii) Regular solutions; where ΔS M is ideal but , (iii) Irregular solutions; in which both ΔS M and ΔH M deviate from their ideal values. Polymer solutions tend to fall into category (iii) and the non-ideal behaviour can be attributed not only to the existence of a finite heat of mixing but also to the large difference in size between the polymer and solvent molecules. The polymer chain can be regarded as a series of small segments covalently bonded together and it is the effect of this chain connectivity which leads to deviations from an ideal entropy of mixing. The effect of connectivity can be assessed by calculating the entropy change associated with the different number of ways of arranging polymer chains and solvent molecules on a lattice and, as it will be demonstrated, this differs from that calculated for the ideal solution. This is embodied in the theory developed by Flory and Huggins, but still represents only the combinatorial contribution, whereas there are other (non-combinatorial) contributions to the entropy which come from the interaction of the polymer with the solvent and are much harder to quantify. Nevertheless, the Flory-Huggins theory forms the cornerstone of polymer solution thermodynamics and is worth considering further. 8.4 Flory-Huggins theory The dissolution of a polymer in a solvent can be regarded as a two stage process. The polymer exists initially in the solid state where it is restricted to only one of the many conformations which are available to it as a free isolated molecule. On passing into the liquid solution the chain achieves relative freedom and can now change rapidly among a multitude of possible equi-energetic conformations, dictated partly by the chain flexibility and partly by the interactions with the solvent. Flory and Huggins considered that formation of the solution depends on (a) the transfer of the polymer chain from a pure, perfectly ordered state to a state of disorder which has the necessary freedom to allow the chain to be placed randomly on a lattice, and (b) the mixing process of the flexible chains with solvent molecules . The formalism of the lattice was used, for convenience, to calculate the combinatorial entropy of mixing following the method outlined in section 8.2 for small molecules, including the same starting assumptions and restrictions. ENTROPY OF MIXING FOR ATHERMAL POLYMER SOLUTIONS Consider a polymer chain consisting of r covalently bonded segments whose size is the same as the solvent molecules, i.e.  where V 1 is the molar volume of component i. To calculate the number of ways this chain can be added to a lattice, the necessary restriction imposed is that the segments must occupy r contiguous sites on the lattice because of the connectivity. The problem is to examine the mixing of N 1 solvent molecules with N 2 monodisperse polymer molecules comprising r segments and we can begin by adding i polymer molecules to an empty lattice with a total number of cells N  Thus the number of vacant cells left which can accommodate the next  molecule will be  The  molecule can now be placed on the lattice, segment by segment, bearing in mind the restrictions imposed, viz. the connectivity of the segments, which requires the placing of each segment in a cell adjoining the preceding one. This in turn will depend on the availability of a suitable vacancy. The first segment can be placed in any empty cell but the second segment is restricted to the immediate near neighbours surrounding the first. This can be given by the co-ordination number of the lattice z but we must also know if a cell in the co-ordination shell is empty. If we let p i be the probability that an adjacent cell is vacant, then to a reasonable approximation this can be equated with the fraction of cells occupied by i polymer chains on the lattice i.e.  which is valid for large values of z. So the expected number of empty cells available for the second segment is zp i , and having removed one more vacant cell from the immediate   vicinity, the third and each succeeding segment will have  empty cells to choose from. The total number of ways in which the  molecule can be placed on the lattice is then   This gives the set of possible ways in which the  molecule can be accommodated on the lattice. The total number of ways for all N 2 molecules to be placed can then be obtained from the product of all possible ways, i.e.  The polymer molecules are all identical and so by analogy with equation (8.2) the total number of distinguishable ways of adding N 2 polymer molecules is  Substituting for W i gives  To evaluate the product term we can multiply and divide by r  This can be converted into the more convenient factorial form by remembering that the product  is equivalent to  and so equation (8.14) can be written as   The remaining empty cells on the lattice can now be filled by solvent molecules, but as there is only one distinguishable way in which this can be done,, there is no further contribution to W p and the entropy of the system. The latter can now be calculated from the Boltzmann equation. The factorials can again be approximated using Stirling's relation and while this requires considerable manipulation, which will be omitted here, it can eventually be shown that  To convert this into a form which will allow us to express this in the correct site fraction form we can add and subtract  on the r.h.s. of equation (8.19) to give  For the pure solvent  and the entropy . Similarly the entropy of the pure polymer S 2 can be obtained for , which gives  Equation 8.21 then represents the entropy associated with the disordered or amorphous polymer on the lattice in the absence of solvent. and so  It follows that the entropy change on mixing disordered polymer and solvent  and so  where φ i the volume fraction can replace the site fraction if it is considered that the number of sites occupied by the polymer and solvent is proportional to their respective volumes. Equation (8.22) is the expression for the combinatorial entropy of mixing of an athermal polymer solution and comparison with equation (8.7) shows that they are similar in form except for the fact that now the volume fraction is found to be the most convenient way of expressing the entropy change, rather than the mole fraction used for small molecules. This change arises from the differences in size between the components which would normally mean mole fractions close to unity for the solvent especially when dilute solutions are being studied. We can gain a further understanding of how the size of the polymer chain affects the magnitude of ΔS M and why it differs from  (equation 8.7), by recasting equation (8.22) in the following way. The volume fraction φ i can be expressed in terms of the number of moles n i , and the volume V i of component i, as   where V is the total volume and . If n i is converted to molar quantities then  As V i can conveniently be expressed as a function of a reference volume V o such that and assuming that, without introducing significant error, r can be equated with the degree of polymerization for the polymer then  If the volume fraction form is retained, then for a simple liquid mixture , but for a polymer solution  and the last term in equation (8.24) will be smaller than the equivalent term calculated for small molecules. Consequently ΔS M per mole of lattice sites (or equivalent volume) will be very much less than  and the contribution of the combinatorial entropy to the mixing process in a polymer solution is not as large as that for solutions of small molecules when calculated in terms of volume fractions and expressed as per mole of sites. 8.5 Enthalpy change on mixing The derivation of ΔS M from the lattice theory has been made on the assumption that no heat or energy change occurs on mixing. This is an uncommon situation as experimental experience suggests that the energy change is finite. We can make use of regular solution theory to obtain an expression for ΔH M where this change in energy is assumed to arise from the formation of new solvent-polymer (1–2) contacts on mixing which replace some of the (1–1) and (2–2) contacts present in the pure solvent, and the pure polymer components respectively. This can be represented by a quasi-chemical process  where the formation of a solvent-polymer contact requires first the breaking of (1–1) and (2–2) contacts, and can be expressed as an interchange energy AΔΕ 12 per contact, given by  Here Ε ii and Ε ij are the contact energies for each species. The energy of mixing ΔU M can be replaced by ΔH M if no volume change takes place on mixing, and for q new contacts formed in solution  The number of contacts can be estimated from the lattice model by assuming that the probability of having a lattice cell occupied by a solvent molecule is simply the volume fraction φ 1 . This means that each polymer molecule will be surrounded by   solvent molecules, and for N 2 polymer molecules  From the definition of φ 2 we obtain , hence  which is the van Laar expression derived for regular solutions and shows that this approach can be applied to polymer systems. To eliminate z, a dimensionless parameter  per solvent molecule, is defined as  which is the difference in energy between a solvent molecule when it is immersed in pure polymer and when in pure solvent. It can also be expressed in the alternative form , where B is now an interaction density. The final expression is  and the interaction parameter χ 1 is an important feature of polymer solution theory which will be met with frequently. 8.6 Free energy of mixing Having calculated the entropy and enthalpy contributions to mixing, these can now be combined to give the expression for the free energy of mixing, as  It is more useful to express equation (8.32) in terms of the chemical potentials of the pure solvent  and the solvent in solution , by differentiating the expression with respect to the number of solvent molecules N 1 to obtain the partial molar Gibbs free energy of dilution (after multiplying by Avogadro's number), This could also be carried out for the polymer , but as it makes no difference which one is taken (both having started from ΔG M ), equation (8.33) is more convenient to use. While this expression is not strictly valid for the dilute solution regime it can be converted into a structure which is extremely informative about deviations from ideal solution behaviour encountered when measuring the molar mass by techniques such as osmotic pressure. If the logarithmic term is expanded using a Taylor series: but truncated after the squared term, assuming φ 2 is small, then, This can be modified by remembering that  and , where v 2 is the partial specific volume of the polymer. This can be related to the polymer molecular weight M 2 through  so that and finally  Let us now anticipate the molar mass measurements to be described in chapter 9 and examine the osmotic pressure of a polymer solution in the light of equation (8.35). 8.7 Osmotic pressure The osmotic pressure π of a solution can be regarded as the pressure which must be exerted on that solution to raise the chemical potential of the solvent in the solution  back up to that of the pure solvent  at a standard pressure P, i.e.  The compressibility of the solvent  is equal to the molar volume of the solvent in solution, V 1 , and can be assumed to be unchanged over a small range of pressures, thus   giving  Substitution in (8.35) gives  or  This is a limited virial expansion in which the first term is the classical van't Hoff expression for the osmotic pressure at infinite dilution. The second term is related to the deviation from ideal behaviour and gives a relationship between the second virial  coefficient B and the interaction parameter χ 1  Thus when  then  and the osmotic pressure is given by the ideal solution law. 8.8 Limitations of the Flory-Huggins theory The simple lattice theory does not describe the behaviour of dilute polymer solutions particularly well because the following simplifications in the theoretical treatment are invalid: (1) it was assumed that the segment-locating process is purely statistical, but this would only be true if ΔΕ 12 was zero; (2) the treatment assumed that the flexibility of the chain is unaltered on passing into the solution from the solid state — this limits the calculation of ΔS M to the combinatorial contribution only and neglects any contribution from continual flexing of the chain in solution which will contribute to the non-combinatorial or excess entropy of mixing; (3) any possible specific solvent-polymer interactions which might lead to orientation of the solvent molecules in the vicinity of the polymer chain are neglected i.e. polar solutions may be inadequately catered for by this theory; (4) a uniform density of lattice site occupation is assumed, but this will only apply to relatively concentrated solutions; (5) the parameter χ 1 is often concentration-dependent but this is ignored . It is now accepted that a non-combinatorial entropy contribution arises from the formation of new (1–2) contacts in the mixture which change the vibrational frequencies of the two components, i.e. assumption (d) in section 8.2 must be relaxed. This can be allowed for by recognizing that χ 1 is actually a free energy parameter comprising entropic χ H and enthalpic χ S contributions, such that. These are defined by  Experiments tend to show that the major contribution comes from the χ s component, indicating that there is a large decrease in entropy (non-combinatorial) which is acting against the dissolution process of a polymer in a solvent. In spite of much justifiable criticism, the Flory-Huggins theory can still generate considerable interest because of the limited amount of success which can be claimed for it in relation to phase equilibria studies. 8.9 Phase equilibria Use can be made of the Flory-Huggins theory to predict the equilibrium behaviour of two liquid phases when both contain amorphous polymer and one or even two solvents. Consider a two component system consisting of a liquid (1) which is a poor solvent for a polymer (2). Complete miscibility occurs when the Gibbs free energy of mixing is less than the Gibbs free energies of the components, and the solution maintains its homogeneity only as long as ΔG M remains less than the Gibbs free energy of any two possible co-existing phases. The situation is represented by curve T 5 in figure 8.2. The miscibility of this type of system is observed to be strongly temperature dependent and as T decreases the solution separates into two phases. Thus at any temperature, say T 1 ,; the Gibbs free energy of any mixture, composition  in the composition range  to , is higher than either of the two co-existing phases whose compositions are  and  and phase separation takes place. The compositions of the two phases  and  do not  correspond to the two minima, but are measured from the points of contact of the double tangent AB with the Gibbs free energy curve. The same is true for other temperatures lying below T c , and the inflexion points can be joined to bound an area representing the heterogeneous two phase system, where there is limited solubility of component 2 in 1 and vice-versa. This is called a cloud-point curve. As the temperature is increased the limits of this two phase co-existence contract, until eventually they coalesce to produce a homogeneous, one phase, mixture at T c , the critical solution temperature. This is sometimes referred to as the critical consolute point. In general, we can say that if the free energy-composition curve has a shape which allows a tangent to touch it at two points, phase separation will occur. The critical solution temperature is an important quantity and can be accurately defined in terms of the chemical potential. It represents the point at which the inflexion points on the curve merge, and so it is the temperature where the first, second, and third derivatives of the Gibbs free energy with respect to mole fraction are zero. It is also true that the partial molar Gibbs free energies of each component are equal at this point and it emerges that the conditions for incipient phase separation are  By remembering that , application of these criteria for equilibrium to equation (8.33) leads to the first derivative of that equation  while the second derivative is  where the subscript c denotes critical conditions. The critical composition at which phase separation is first detected is then  and  which indicates that  at infinitely large chain length. The interaction parameter χ 1 is a useful measure of the solvent power. Poor solvents have values of χ 1 close to 0.5 while an improvement in solvent power lowers χ 1 . Generally, a variation from 0.5 to -1.0 can be observed although for many synthetic polymer solutions the range is 0.6 to 0.3. A linear temperature dependence for χ 1 is also predicted of the general form , which suggests that as the temperature increases the solvating power of the liquid should increase. This has implications for polymer fractionation. 8.10 Fractionation The relations derived in this and other chapters normally assume that the polymer sample has a unique molar mass. This situation is rarely achieved in practice and it is useful to know the form of the molar mass distribution in a sample, as this can have a significant bearing on the physical properties. It is also advantageous to be able to prepare sample fractions, whose homogeneity is considerably better than the parent polymer, especially when testing dilute solution theory. We have seen that the chain length can be related to the solvent power, expressed as χ 1 , by equation (8.46) and this is illustrated in figure 8.3. The implication is that if χ 1 can be carefully controlled, conditions could be attained which would allow a given molecular species to precipitate, while leaving larger or smaller molecules in solution. This process is known as fractionation. Experimentally, a polymer sample can be fractionated in a variety of ways and three in common use are: (1) addition of a non-solvent to a polymer solution; (2) lowering the temperature of the solution; and (3) column chromatography . In the first method the control of χ 1 is effected by adding a non-solvent to the polymer solution. If the addition is slow, χ 1 increases gradually until the critical value for large molecules is reached. This causes precipitation of the longest chains first and these can be separated from the shorter chains which remain in solution. In practice the polymer solution is held at a constant temperature while precipitant is added to the stirred solution. When the solution becomes turbid the mixture is warmed until the precipitate dissolves. The solution is then returned to the original temperature and the   precipitate which reforms is allowed to settle and then separated. This ensures that the precipitated fraction is not broadened by local precipitation during addition of the non-solvent. Successive additions of small quantities of non-solvent to the solution allow a series of fractions of steadily decreasing molar mass to be separated. In the second method, χ 1 is varied by altering the temperature, with similar results. For both techniques, it is useful to dissolve the polymer initially in a poor solvent with a large χ 1 value. This ensures that only small quantities of non-solvent are required to precipitate the polymer in method 1, and that the temperature changes required in method 2 are small. In column chromatography the polymer is precipitated on the inert support medium at the top of a column which has a temperature gradient imposed along its length. The packing is usually glass beads of 0.1 to 0.3 mm diameter. A solvent + non-solvent mixture is used to elute the sample and fractionation is achieved by using a solvent gradient. This is generated in a mixing system, situated above the column, by constantly increasing the solvent to non-solvent ratio and as the mixture is initially a poor solvent which is gradually enriched by the good solvent the low molar mass fractions are eluted first. Fractions of increasing molar mass are collected from the bottom of the column. In each of the techniques, the mass and molar mass of the fractions are recorded and a distribution curve for the sample can be constructed from the results. However, as the fractions themselves have a molar mass distribution, extensive overlapping of the fractions will occur as shown schematically in figure 8.4. Consequently a simple histogram constructed from the mass and molar mass of each fraction will not provide a good representation of the distribution and a method must be used to compensate for the overlapping. A useful approach was proposed by Schulz who suggested that a cumulative mass fraction be plotted against the molar mass. The cumulative mass fraction  can be calculated by adding half the mass fraction W i of the i th fraction to the total mass fraction    of those fractions preceding it, i.e.  The values of  are plotted against the corresponding M i and connected by a smooth curve as shown in figure 8.5, to give the integral distribution curve. The differential curve can be obtained by determining the slope of this curve at selected molar masses and plotting this against the appropriate molar mass. 8.11 Flory-Krigbaum theory To overcome the limitations of the lattice theory resulting from the discontinuous nature of a dilute polymer solution, Flory and Krigbaum discarded the idea of a uniform distribution of chain segments in the liquid. Instead they considered the solution to be composed of areas containing polymer which were separated by the solvent. In these areas the polymer segments were assumed to possess a Gaussian distribution about the centre of mass, but even with this distribution the chain segments still occupy a finite volume from which all other chain segments are excluded. It is within this excluded volume that the long range interactions originate which are discussed more fully in chapter 10. Flory and Krigbaum defined an enthalpy  parameter and an entropy of dilution  parameter such that the thermodynamic functions used to describe these long  range effects are given in terms of the excess partial molar quantities   From equation (8.33) it can be seen that the excess free energy of dilution is  Combination of these non-ideal terms then yields  As we saw from equation (8.40), when  and  the solution appears to behave as though it were ideal. The point at which this occurs is known as the FLORY or THETA point and is in some ways analogous to the Boyle point for a non-ideal gas. Under these conditions  The temperature at which these conditions are obtained is the FLORY or THETA temperature Θ, conveniently defined as . This tells us that Θ will only have a meaningful value when ψ 1 and κ 1 have the same sign. Substitution in (8.50) followed by rearrangement gives  and shows that deviations from ideal behaviour vanish when . The theta temperature is a well defined state of the polymer solution at which the excluded volume effects are eliminated and the polymer coil is in an unperturbed condition (see chapter 10). Above the theta temperature expansion of the coil takes place, caused by interactions with the solvent, whereas below * the polymer segments attract one another, the excluded volume is negative, the coils tend to collapse and eventual phase separation occurs. 8.12 Location of the theta temperature The theta temperature of a polymer-solvent system can be measured from phase separation studies. The value of χ 1 . c; at the critical concentration is related to the chain length of the polymer by equation (8.46), and substitution in (8.52) leads to  where now we have replaced r with the equivalent degree of polymerization χ n . Rearrangement gives    Remembering that , where M and  are the molar mass and partial specific volume of the polymer, and V 1 is the molar volume of the solvent, the equation states that the critical temperature is a function of M and the value of T c at infinite M is the theta temperature for the system. Precipitation data for several systems have proved the validity of equation (8.54). Linear plots are obtained with a positive slope from which the entropy parameter ψ 1 can be calculated as shown in figure 8.6. Typical values are shown in table 8.1, but ψ 1 values measured for systems such as polystyrene + cyclohexane have been found to be almost ten times larger than those derived from other methods of measurement. This appears to arise from the assumption in the Flory-Huggins theory that χ 1 is concentration independent and improved values of ψ 1 are obtained when this is rectified. The theta temperature, calculated from equation (8.54) for each system is in good agreement with that measured from the temperature variation of A 2 (=B/RT see chapter 9). Curves of A 2 , measured at various temperatures in the vicinity of Θ, are constructed as a function of temperature for one or more molar masses as shown in figure 8.7. Intersection of the curves with the T-axis occurs when  and . The curves for each molar mass of the same polymer should all intersect at . 8.13 Lower critical solution temperatures So far we have been concerned with non-polar solutions of amorphous polymers, whose solubility is increased with rising temperature, because the additional thermal motion helps to decrease attractive forces between like molecules, and encourages energetically less favourable contacts. The phase diagram for such systems, when the solvent is poor, is depicted by area A in figure 8.8, where the critical temperature T c occurs near the maximum of the cloud-point curve and is often referred to as the upper   critical solution temperature (UCST). This behaviour follows from that depicted in figure 8.2. For non-polar systems ΔS M is normally positive but weighted heavily by T and so solubility depends mainly on the magnitude of ΔH M , which is normally endothermic (positive). Consequently as T decreases ΔG M eventually becomes positive and phase separation takes place. Values of Θ and ψ 1 , in table 8.1, show that for systems 1 to 4 the entropy parameter is positive, as expected, but for poly (acrylic acid) in dioxan and polymethacrylonitrile in butanone, ψ is negative at the theta temperature. As , when , the enthalpy is also negative for these systems. This means that systems 5 and 6 exhibit an unusual decrease in solubility as the temperature rises, and the cloud-point curve is now inverted as in area B. The corresponding critical temperature is located at the minimum of the miscibility curve and is known as the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). In systems 5 and 6 this phenomenon is a result of hydrogen-bond formation between the polymer and solvent, which enhances the solubility. As hydrogen bonds are thermally labile a rise in T reduces the number of bonds and causes eventual phase separation. In solutions, which are stabilized in this way by secondary bonding, the LCST usually appears below the boiling temperature of the solvent but it has been found experimentally that an LCST can be detected in non-polar systems when these are examined at temperatures approaching the critical temperature of the solvent. Polyisobutylene in a series of n-alkanes, polystyrene in methyl acetate and cyclohexane, and cellulose acetate in acetone all exhibit LCSTs. The LCST is located by heating the solutions, in sealed tubes, up to temperatures approaching the gas-liquid critical point of the solvent. As the temperature rises, the liquid expands much more rapidly than the polymer, which is restrained by the  covalent bonding between its segments. At high temperatures, the spaces between the solvent molecules have to be reduced if mixing is to take place and when this eventually results in too great a loss of entropy, phase separation occurs. The separation of polymer/solvent systems into two phases as the temperature increases is now recognized to be a characteristic feature of all polymer solutions. This presents a problem of interpretation within the framework of regular solution theory, as the accepted form of χ 1 predicts a monotonic change with temperature and is incapable of dealing with two critical consolute points. The problem of how to accommodate, in a theoretical framework, the existence of two miscibility gaps requires a new approach, and a more elaborate treatment by Prigogine and co-workers encompasses the difference in size between the components of a mixture, which cannot be ignored for polymer solutions. They replaced the rigid lattice model used by Flory and Huggins, which is valid only at absolute zero, with a flexible lattice whose cells change volume, with temperature and pressure. This allowed them to include in their theory dissimilarities in free volume between polymer and solvent, together with the corresponding interactions. The same approach was extended by both Patterson and Flory to deal specifically with polymer systems. The most important of the new parameters is the so-called ‘structural effect’ which is related to the number of degrees of freedom ‘3 c ’which a molecule possesses, divided by the number of external contacts q. This structural factor  is a measure of the number of external degrees of freedom per segment and changes with the length of the component. Thus the ratio decreases as a liquid becomes increasingly polymeric. The expansion and free volume can then be characterized by the ratio of the thermal energy arising from the external degrees of freedom available to the component, U thermal , and the interaction energy between neighbouring non-bonded segments, U cohesive which will oppose the thermal energy effects, i.e.  where Ε * is the characteristic cohesive energy per contact. For convenience q may be replaced by r, the number of chain segments, although q will actually be less than r because some of the external contacts are used in forming the covalent bonds in the chain. Free volume dissimilarities become increasingly important as the size of one component increases with respect to the second, as in polymer solutions, and when these differences are sufficiently large, phase separation can be observed at the LCST. The differences in expansivity can be accounted for if the interaction parameter is now expressed as  where the first term reflects the interchange energy on forming contacts of unlike type and includes segment size differences, while the second term is the new ‘structural’ contribution coming from free volume changes on mixing a dense polymer with an expanded solvent. This can be represented schematically in figure 8.9. The first term in (8.56), shown by curve 1, is merely an expression of the Flory-Huggins theory where X decreases constantly with rising temperature, but now   inclusion of the new free volume term, shown by curve 2, modifies the behaviour of χ. The second term gains in importance as the expansivities of the two components become increasingly divergent with temperature and the net effect is to increase χ again until it once more attains its critical value at high temperature. The LCST which results, is then a consequence of these free volume differences and is an entropically controlled phenomenon. This can be illustrated in the following ways. In terms of the flexible lattice model, one can imagine the polymer and liquid lattices expanding at different rates until a temperature is reached at which the highly expanded liquid lattice can no longer be distorted sufficiently to accommodate the less expanded polymer lattice and form a solution, i.e. the loss in entropy during the distortion becomes so large and unfavourable that phase separation (LCST) takes place. Alternatively, a polymer solution can be thought of as a system formed by the condensation of solvent into a polymer. As the temperature increases, the entropy loss incurred during condensation becomes greater until eventually it is so unfavourable that condensation in the polymer is impossible, and phase separation takes place. Neither picture is particularly rigorous but they serve to emphasize the fact that the LCST is an entropically controlled phenomenon. 8.14 Solubility and the cohesive energy density Solvent-polymer compatibility problems are repeatedly encountered in industry. For example, in situations requiring the selection of elastomers for use as hose-pipes or gaskets, the correct choice of elastomer is of prime importance, as contact with highly compatible fluids may cause serious swelling and impair the operation of the system. The wrong selection can have far reaching consequences; the initial choice of an elastomer for the seals in the landing gear of the DC-8 aircraft resulted in serious jamming because the seals become swollen when in contact with the hydraulic fluid. This almost led to grounding of the plane but replacement with an incompatible elastomer made from ethylene-propylene copolymer rectified the fault. To avoid such problems a technologist may wish to have at his disposal a rough guide to aid the selection of solvents for a polymer or to assess the extent of polymer-liquid interaction other than those already described. Here use can be made of a semi-empirical approach suggested by Hildebrand and based on the premise that ‘like dissolves like’. The treatment involves relating the enthalpy of mixing to the cohesive energy density  and defines a solubility parameter , where E is the molar energy of vaporization and V is the molar volume of the component. The    proposed relation for the heat of mixing of two non-polar components  shows that ΔH M is small for mixtures with similar solubility parameters and this indicates compatibility. Values of the solubility parameter for simple liquids can be readily calculated from the enthalpy of vaporization. The same method cannot be used for a polymer and one must resort to comparative techniques. Usually δ for a polymer is established by finding the solvent which will produce maximum swelling of a network or the largest value of the limiting viscosity number, as both indicate maximum compatibility. The polymer is then assigned a similar value of δ. Alternatively, Small and Hoy have tabulated a series of group molar attraction constants from which a good estimate of δ for most polymers can be made. The suggested group contributions are shown in table 8.3 and the solubility parameter for a polymer can be estimated from the sum of the various molar attraction constants F for the groups which make up the repeat unit i.e.   Here V is the molar volume of the repeat unit whose molar mass is M o and p is the polymer density. Thus for poly (methyl methacrylate) with  and , we have using the Hoy values  Therefore  For a more complex polyhydroxyether of Bisphenol A structure and with   Both estimates are within 10 per cent of experimentally determined values. Attempts to correlate δ with χ 1 from the Flory-Huggins equation have met with limited success because of the unjustifiable assumptions made in the derivation. It is now believed, however, that χ 1 is not an enthalpy parameter but a free energy parameter and a relation of the form c.f. section 8.8  has improved the correlation. Here  is supposed to compensate for the lack of a non-combinatorial entropy contribution in the Flory-Huggins treatment. Unfortunately, solubility is not a simple process and secondary bonding may play an important role in determining component interactions. More detailed approaches have been suggested, which introduce a three-dimensional δ composed of contributions from van der Waals dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The overall solubility parameter is then the sum of the various contributions  Usually two dimensional plots are constructed first, before the three dimensional ‘solubility volume’ is established, as shown in figure 8.10. This is not a convenient construction and often a plot of  versus δ H is considered to be sufficiently accurate as δ n and δ p are usually similar and the main polar contribution comes from the hydrogen bonding factor δ H . 8.15 Polymer-polymer mixtures In the constant search for new materials with improved performance, the idea of mixing two or more different polymers to form new substances having a combination of all the attributes of the components, is deceptively attractive. Deceptively, because in practice  it is rarely accomplished and only in a few cases have polymer blends or mixtures achieved industrial importance. The main reason is that most common polymers do not mix with one another to form homogeneous, one phase solutions or blends, and an explanation for this is to be found in the thermodynamics of solutions which have been outlined in the previous sections. As we have seen, when two liquids, or a liquid and a polymer are mixed, the formation of a homogeneous, one phase solution is assisted mainly by the large favourable gain in combinatorial entropy. This entropic contribution is progressively reduced when one or both components increase in size, and the reason for this becomes obvious on inspection of equation (8.24). When r 1 and r 2 both increase, then ΔS M becomes smaller; consequently attempts to mix two high molar mass polymer samples will receive little assistance from this function and must depend increasingly on a favourable (negative) heat of mixing embodied in the χ parameter. This loss of entropy can be conveniently illustrated using the simple lattice model shown in figure 8.11. Here a 10 x 10 lattice, containing 50 white and 50 black units randomly mixed (a), will result in approximately 10 30 possible different arrangements of the units on mixing. If these white units are now connected to other white units, and black to black (b), to form five equal chains of each colour with , then the number of possible arrangements of these chains decreases to about 10 3 . Thus as r 1 and r 2 approach infinity ΔS M will become negligible and the free energy of mixing will become essentially dependent on ΔH M which now has to be either very small or negative. The heat of mixing for the majority of polymer (1)— polymer (2) pairs tends to be endothermic and can be approximated by reference to the solubility parameters using equation (8.57). This can be written as    where the reference volume normally assumes a value of . The critical value for χ 12 can be estimated from  where x i is the degree of polymerization, related to the actual degree of polymerization x n and the reference volume by  with V R the molar volume of the repeat unit. The critical values for χ 12 above which the two polymers will phase separate, calculated for various mixtures with , are shown in table 8.4 along with the corresponding differences in δ. This shows that for mixing to take place between high molecular weight components the solubility parameters would have to be virtually identical. This limits the number of possible combinations such that only a few examples exist in this category. These include polystyrene/ poly (α-methyl styrene) below M  70 000, and the polyacrylates mixed with the corresponding poly vinyl esters, e.g.  and  The situation changes if ΔH M is negative as this will encourage mixing, and the search for binary polymer blends which are miscible has focussed on combinations in which specific intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, ion-dipole interactions, or charge transfer complex formation, can exist between the component polymers. A substantial number of miscible blends have now been discovered using this principle and it is possible to identify certain groups or repeat units, which when incorporated in polymer chains tend to enter into these intermolecular interactions and enhance the miscibility. A short selection of some of these complementary groups is given in table 8.5, where    a polymer containing groups or composed of units from column 1 will tend to form miscible blends with polymers containing groups or composed of units from column 2. Thus it is believed that polystyrene forms miscible blends with poly (vinyl methylether), and with poly (phenylene oxide) s (examples 1 and 2, respectively) because of interactions between the π-electrons of the phenyl rings and the lone pairs of the ether oxygens. Similarly it has been suggested that a weak hydrogen bond, which is strong enough to induce miscibility can form between the carbonyl unit of poly (methyl methacrylate) and the α-hydrogen of poly (vinyl chloride)(example 3 where ). i.e.   Much stronger hydrogen bonding interactions can be obtained if units such as or sites for ion-dipole interactions such as can be built into chains, and even in relatively small amounts these can transform immiscible pairs into totally miscible blends. Many of these blends undergo quite rapid demixing as the temperature is raised and an LCST phase boundary can be located above the glass transition temperature of the blend. The origins of the lower critical phase separation phenomenon in polymer blends are not yet clearly understood and three possible causes have been proposed. (i) Free volume dissimilarities may become unfavourable to mixing on increasing the temperature. (ii) There may be unfavourable entropy contributions arising from non-random mixing. (iii) A temperature dependent heat of mixing may result if specific intermolecular interactions, which dissociate on heating, are responsible for miscibility at lower temperatures. While the latter seems the most likely cause in many blends where specific interactions have been identified, miscible blends can also be obtained when certain statistical copolymers are mixed with either a homopolymer, or another copolymer, in which no such interactions have been located. Thus poly (styrene-stat-acrylonitrile) will form miscible blends with poly (methyl methacrylate) if the composition of the copolymer lies in the range 10–39 wt% acrylonitrile. This range of compositions is called the ‘miscibility window’ and has been reported to be present in other systems. The drive  towards formation of a miscible solid solution in these cases is believed to arise when large repulsive interactions exist between the monomer units (A) and (B) comprising the copolymer; on mixing with a polymer (C), the number of these unfavourable (A B) contacts are reduced by forming less repulsive (A-C) or (B-C) contacts and a miscible blend results. Many of these blends also exhibit an LCST. Thus the driving force towards lower critical phase separation in polymer-polymer solutions may depend on the system or may be a combination of the effects (i)—(iii)."
ACA ACA-HRG-006 -0.39 "CHAPTER 13 Mechanical Properties 13.1 Viscoelastic state The fabrication of an article from a polymeric material in the bulk state, whether it be the moulding of a thermosetting plastic or the spinning of a fibre from the melt, involves deformation of the material by applied forces. Afterwards, the finished article is inevitably subjected to stresses, hence it is important to be aware of the mechanical and rheological properties of each material and understand the basic principles underlying their response to such forces. In classical terms the mechanical properties of elastic solids can be described by Hooke's law, which states that an applied stress is proportional to the resultant strain, but is independent of the rate of strain. For liquids the corresponding statement is known as Newton's law, with the stress now independent of the strain, but proportional to the rate of strain. Both are limiting laws, valid only for small strains or rates of strain, and while it is essential that conditions involving large stresses, leading to eventual mechanical failure, be studied, it is also important to examine the response to small mechanical stresses. Both laws can prove useful under these circumstances. In many cases, a material may exhibit the characteristics of both a liquid and a solid and neither of the limiting laws will adequately describe its behaviour. The system is then said to be in a viscoelastic state. A particularly good illustration of a viscoelastic material is provided by a silicone polymer known as ‘bouncing putty’. If a sample is rolled into the shape of a sphere it can be bounced like a rubber ball, i.e. the rapid application and removal of a stress causes the material to behave like an elastic body. If on the other hand, a stress is applied slowly over a longer period the material flows like a viscous liquid so that the spherical shape is soon lost if left to stand for some time. Pitch behaves in a similar, if less spectacular, manner. Before examining the viscoelastic behaviour of amorphous polymeric substances in more detail, some of the fundamental terms used will be defined. 13.2 Mechanical properties Homogeneous, isotropic, elastic materials possess the simplest mechanical properties and three elementary types of elastic deformation can be observed when such a body is subjected to (i) simple tension, (ii) simple shear, and (iii) uniform compression. Simple tension. Consider a parallelepiped of length x o and cross-sectional area   . If this is subjected to a balanced pair of tensile forces F, its length changes by an increment dx so that . When dx is small, Hooke's law is obeyed, and the tensile stress σ is proportional to the tensile strain Ε. The constant of proportionality is known as the modulus, and for elastic solids  where E is Young's modulus The stress σ is a measure of the force per unit area , and the strain or elongation is defined as the extension per unit length, i.e. . It should be pointed out, however, that other definitions of strain will be met with in the literature, most notably, is often called the true strain, while an expression arising from the kinetic theory of elasticity has the form  Of course, the extension dx will be accompanied by lateral contractions dy and dz, but although normally negative and equal, they can usually be assumed to be zero. For an isotropic body, the change in length per unit length is related to the change in width per unit of length, such that where υ p is known as Poisson's ratio and varies from 0.5, when no volume change occurs, to about 0.2. Simple shear. In simple shear the shape change is not accompanied by any change in volume. If the base of the body, shown shaded in the diagram, figure 13.1(b) is firmly   fixed, a transverse force F applied to the opposite face is sufficient to cause a deformation dx through an angle θ. The shear modulus C is then given by the quotient of the shearing force per unit area and the shear per unit distance between shearing surfaces; and so  For very small shearing strains tan θ  θ and  Both E and G depend on the shape of the specimen and it is usually necessary to define the shape carefully for any measurement. Uniform compression. When a hydrostatic pressure — p is applied to a body of volume V o , causing a change in volume ΔV, a bulk modulus B can be defined as  The quantity B is often expressed in terms of the compressibility which is the reciprocal of the bulk modulus. Similarly  and  are known as the tensile and shear compliances and given the symbols D and J respectively. 13.3 Interrelation of moduli The relations given above pertain to isotropic bodies and for non-isotropic bodies the equations are considerably more complex. Polymeric materials are normally either amorphous, or partially crystalline with randomly oriented crystallites embedded in a disordered matrix. However, any symmetry possessed by an individual crystallite can be disregarded and the body as a whole is treated as being isotropic. The various moduli can be related to each other in a simple manner, because an isotropic body is considered to possess only two independent elastic constants and so  This indicates, that for an incompressible elastic solid, i.e. one having a Poisson ratio of 0.5, Young's modulus is three times larger than the shear modulus. These moduli have dimensions of pressure and typical values for several polymeric and non-polymeric materials can be compared at ambient temperatures in table 13.1. The response of polymers to mechanical stresses can vary widely, and depends on the particular state the polymer is in at any given temperature. 13.4 Mechanical models describing viscoelasticity A perfectly elastic material obeying Hooke's law behaves like a perfect spring. The stress-strain diagram is shown in figure 13.2(a), and can be represented in mechanical terms by the model of a weightless spring whose modulus of extension represents the modulus of the material. The application of a shear stress to a viscous liquid on the other hand, is relieved by viscous flow, and for small values of σ s can be described by Newton's law  where η is the coefficient of viscosity and  is the rate of shear sometimes denoted by γ. As stress is now independent of the strain the form of the diagram changes and can be represented by a dashpot which is a loose fitting piston in a cylinder containing a liquid of viscosity η. (Figure 13.2(b).) Comparison of the two models shows that the spring represents a system storing energy which is recoverable, whereas the dashpot represents the dissipation of energy in the form of heat by a viscous material subjected to a deforming force. The dashpot is used to denote the retarded nature of the response of a material to any applied stress. Because of their chain-like structure, polymers are not perfectly elastic bodies and deformation is accompanied by a complex series of long and short range co-operative molecular rearrangements. Consequently, the mechanical behaviour is dominated by viscoelastic phenomena, in contrast to materials such as metal and glass where atomic adjustments under stress are more localized and limited. The Maxwell model. One of the first attempts to explain the mechanical behaviour of materials such as pitch and tar was made by James Clark Maxwell. He argued that when a material can undergo viscous flow and also respond elastically to a stress it should be described by a combination of both the Newton and Hooke laws. This assumes that both contributions to the strain are additive so that . Expressing this as the differential equation leads to the equation of motion of a Maxwell unit  Under conditions of constant shear strain  the relation becomes  and if the boundary condition is assumed that  at zero time, the solution to this equation is  where σ o is the initial stress immediately after stretching the polymer. This shows that when a Maxwell element is held at a fixed shear strain, the shearing stress will relax exponentially with time. At a time  the stress is reduced to  times the original value and this characteristic time is known as the relaxation time τ. The equations can be generalized for both shear and tension and G can be replaced by E. The mechanical analogue for the Maxwell unit can be represented by a combination of a spring and a dashpot arranged in series so that the stress is the same on both elements. This means that the total strain is the sum of the strains on each element as expressed by equation (13.7). A typical stress-strain curve predicted by the Maxwell model, is shown in figure 13.3(a). Under conditions of constant stress, a   Maxwell body shows instantaneous elastic deformation first, followed by a viscous flow. Voigt-Kelvin model. A second simple mechanical model can be constructed from the ideal elements by placing a spring and dashpot in parallel. This is known as a Voigt Kelvin model. Any applied stress is now shared between the elements and each is subjected to the same deformation. The corresponding expression for strain is  Here  is known as the retardation time and is a measure of the time delay in the strain after imposition of the stress. For high values of the viscosity, the retardation time is long and this represents the length of time the model takes to attain  or 0.632 of the equilibrium elongation. Such models are much too simple to describe the complex viscoelastic behaviour of a polymer, nor do they provide any real insight into the molecular mechanism of the process, but in certain instances they can prove useful in assisting the understanding of the viscoelastic process. 13.5 Linear viscoelastic behaviour of amorphous polymers A polymer can possess a wide range of material properties and of these the hardness, deformability, toughness, and ultimate strength, are amongst the most significant. Certain features, such as high rigidity (modulus) and impact strength, combined with low creep characteristics are desirable in a polymer if eventually it is to be subjected to loading. Unfortunately, these are conflicting properties, as a polymer with a high modulus and low creep response does not absorb energy by deforming easily, hence has poor impact strength. This means a compromise must be sought depending on the use to which the polymer will be put, and this requires a knowledge of the mechanical response in detail. The early work on viscoelasticity was performed on silk, rubber, and glass, and it was concluded that these materials exhibited a ‘delayed elasticity’ manifest in the observation, that the imposition of a stress resulted in an instantaneous strain which continued to increase more slowly, with time. It is this delay between cause and effect that is fundamental to the observed viscoelastic response and the three major examples of this hysteresis effect are (1) Creep, where there is a delayed strain response after the rapid application of a stress, (2) Stress-relaxation (section 13.7) in which the material is quickly subjected to a strain and a subsequent decay of stress is observed, and (3) Dynamic response (section 13.9) of a body to the imposition of a steady sinusoidal stress. This produces a strain oscillating with the same frequency as, but out of phase with, the stress. For maximum usefulness, these measurements must be carried out over a wide range of temperature. CREEP To be of any practical use, an object made from a polymeric material must be able to retain its shape when subjected to even small tensions or compressions over long periods of time. This dimensional stability is an important consideration in choosing a polymer to use in the manufacture of an item. No one wants a plastic telephone receiver  which sags after sitting in its cradle for several weeks, or a car tyre that develops a flat spot if parked in one position for too long, or clothes made from synthetic fibres which become baggy and deformed after short periods of wear. Creep tests provide a measure of this tendency to deform and are relatively easy to carry out. Creep can be defined as a progressive increase in strain, observed over an extended time period, in a polymer subjected to a constant stress. Measurements are carried out on a sample clamped in a thermostat. A constant load is firmly fixed to one end and the elongation is followed by measuring the relative movement of two fiducial marks, made initially on the polymer, as a function of time. To avoid excessive changes in the sample cross section, elongations are limited to a few per cent and are followed over approximately three decades of time. The initial, almost instantaneous, elongation produced by the application of the tensile stress is inversely proportional to the rigidity or modulus of the material, i.e. an elastomer with a low modulus stretches considerably more than a material in the glassy state with a high modulus. The initial deformation corresponds to portion OA of the curve (figure 13.4), increment a. This rapid response is followed by a region of creep, A to B, initially fast but eventually slowing down to a constant rate represented by the section B to C. When the stress is removed the instantaneous elastic response OA is completely recovered and the curve drops from C to D, i.e. the distance . There follows a slower recovery in the region D to E which is never complete, falling short of the initial state by an increment . This is a measure of the viscous flow experienced by the sample and is a completely non-recoverable response. If the tensile load is enlarged, both the elongation and the creep rate increase, so results are usually reported in terms of the creep compliance J(t), defined as the ratio of the relative elongation y at   time t to the stress so that  At low loads J(t) is independent of the load. This idealized picture of creep behaviour in a polymer has its mechanical equivalent constructed from the springs and dashpots described earlier. The changes a and a′ correspond to the elastic response of the polymer and so we can begin with a Hookean spring. The Voigt-Kelvin model is embodied in equation (13.11) and this reproduces the changes b and b′. The final changes c and c′ represent viscous flow and can be represented by a dashpot so that the whole model is a four element model — figure 13.5. The behaviour can be explained in the following series of steps. In diagram (i) the system is at rest. The stress σ is applied to spring E 1 and dashpot η 3 ; it is also shared by E 2 and η 2 but in a manner which varies with time. In diagram (ii), representing zero time, the spring E 1 extends by an amount . This is followed by a decreasing rate of creep with a progressively increasing amount of stress being carried by E 2 until eventually none is carried by η 2 and E 2 is fully extended — diagram (iii). Such behaviour is described by  where the retardation time τ R provides a measure of the time required for E 2 and η 2 to reach 0.632 of their total deformation. A considerably longer time is required for complete deformation to occur. When spring E 2 is fully extended the creep attains a constant rate corresponding to movement in the dashpot η 3 . Viscous flow continues and the dashpot η 3 is deformed until the stress is removed. At that time, E 1 retracts quickly along section a′ and a period of recovery ensues (b′). During this time spring E 2 forces the dashpot plunger in η 2 back to its original position. As no force acts on η 3 it remains in the extended state, and corresponds to the non-recoverable viscous flow; region . The system is then as shown in diagram (v). In practice, a substance possesses a large number of retardation times which can be expressed as a distribution   function  where  To the first approximation, this is estimated from a plot of creep compliance against , and  is the contribution from viscous flow. STRESS-STRAIN MEASUREMENTS The data derived from stress-strain measurements on thermoplastics are important from a practical viewpoint, providing as they do, information on the modulus, the brittleness, and the ultimate and yield strengths of the polymer. By subjecting the specimen to a tensile force applied at a uniform rate and measuring the resulting deformation, a curve of the type shown in figure 13.6 can be constructed. The shape of such a curve is dependent on the rate of testing, consequently, this must be specified if a meaningful comparison of data is to be made. The initial portion of the curve is linear and the tensile modulus E is obtained from its slope. The point L represents the stress beyond which a brittle material will fracture, and the area under the curve to this point is proportional to the energy required for brittle fracture. If the material is tough no fracture occurs, and the curve then passes through a maximum or inflection point Y, known as the yield point. Beyond this, the ultimate elongation is eventually reached and the polymer breaks at B. The area under this part of the curve is the energy required for tough fracture to take place. EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON STRESS-STRAIN RESPONSE Polymers such as polystyrene and poly (methyl methacrylate) with a high E at ambient temperatures fall into the category of hard brittle materials which break before point Y is reached. Hard tough polymers can be typified by cellulose acetate and several curves measured at different temperatures are shown in figure 13.7(a). Stress-strain curves for poly (methyl methacrylate) are also shown for comparison (figure 13.7(b)). It can be seen that the effect of temperature on the characteristic shape of the curve is significant. As the temperature increases both the rigidity and the yield strength decrease while the elongation generally increases. For cellulose acetate there is a transformation from a hard brittle state below 273 K to a softer but tougher type of polymer at temperatures above 273 K. For poly (methyl methacrylate) the hard brittle characteristics are retained to a much higher temperature, but it eventually reaches a soft tough state at about 320 K. Thus if the requirements of high rigidity and toughness are to be met, the temperature is important. Cellulose acetate meets these requirements if used at 298 K more satisfactorily than when used at 350 K where the modulus is smaller and the ability to absorb energy, represented by the area under the curve, is also lower. 13.6 Boltzmann superposition principle If a Hookean spring is subjected to a series of incremental stresses at various times, the resulting extensions will be independent of the loading or past history of the spring. A Newtonian dashpot also behaves in a predictable manner. For viscoelastic materials the response to mechanical testing is time dependent, but the behaviour at any time can be predicted by applying a superposition principle proposed by Boltzmann. This can be illustrated by a creep test using a simple Voigt-Kelvin model with a single retardation time τ R , placed initially under a stress σ o at time t o . If after times t 1 , t 2 , t 3 ,…the system is subjected to additional stresses σ 1 , σ 2 , σ 3 ,…then the principle states that the creep response of the system can be predicted simply by summing the individual responses from each stress increment. Thus if the stress alters continually, the summation can be   replaced by an integral, and σ n by a continually varying function, so that at time t * when the stress  existed, the strain is given by  The principle has been applied successfully to the tensile creep of amorphous and rubber-like polymers, but it is not too successful if appreciable crystallinity exists in the sample. Graphical representation of the principle is shown in figure 13.8. 13.7 Stress-relaxation Stress-relaxation experiments involve the measurement of the force required to maintain the deformation produced initially by an applied stress as a function of time. Stress-relaxation tests are not performed as often as creep tests because many investigators believe they are less readily understood. The latter point is debatable and it may only be that the practical aspects of creep measurements are simpler. As will be shown later, all the mechanical parameters are in theory interchangeable, and so all such measurements will contribute to the understanding of viscoelastic theory. While stress-relaxation measurements are useful in a general study of polymeric behaviour, they are particularly useful in the evaluation of antioxidants in polymers, especially elastomers, because measurements on such systems are relatively easy to perform and are sensitive to bond rupture in the network. Experimental stress-relaxation technique. In a stress-relaxation experiment, the sample under study is deformed by a rapidly applied stress. As the stress is normally observed  to reach a maximum as soon as the material deforms and then decreases thereafter, it is necessary to alter this continually in order to maintain a constant deformation or measure the stress that would be required to accomplish this operation. The apparatus used varies in complexity with the physical nature of the sample, being simplest for an elastomer and becoming more sophisticated when the polymer is more rigid. One type of experimental set up is shown in figure 13.9. The sample is fixed in position by means of clamps, one being attached to a spring beam above and the other to an adjustable rod R below. A stress is applied to the sample by rapidly pulling rod R downwards and clamping it in position. This causes the beam to bend and the displacement is measured by means of a strain gauge or a differential transformer. The beam deflection is then fed to a recorder and a trace of stress against time is obtained. The results are expressed as a relaxation modulus  which is a function of the time of observation. Typical data for polyisobutylene are shown in section 13.14, figure 13.21, where the logarithm of the relaxation modulus log  is plotted against log t. From the curves it can be seen that there is a rapid change in log  over a narrow range of temperature corresponding to the glass transition. Again a simple model with a single relaxation time is too crude, and the stress relaxation modulus  is better represented by  where  is the distribution function of relaxation times. This is suitable for a linear polymer but requires the additional term E∞, if the material is crosslinked. 13.8 Dynamic mechanical and dielectric thermal analysis Non-destructive testing methods are particularly useful for assessing the physical properties of polymeric materials when an understanding of the performance at a molecular level is important. The foregoing techniques for measuring mechanical properties are transient or non periodic methods and typically cover time intervals of up to 10 6 s. For information relating to short times, two approaches that have been widely used are dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and dielectric thermal analysis (DETA). These are both particular kinds of relaxation spectroscopy in which the sample is perturbed by a sinusoidal force (either mechanical or electrical) and the response of the material is measured over a range of temperatures and at different frequencies of the applied force. From an analysis of the material response it is possible to derive information about the molecular motions in the sample, and how these can affect the modulus, damping characteristics and structural transitions. Both techniques can be used to probe molecular motions in liquid or solid polymers, but when dielectric spectroscopy is used the relaxation or transition must involve movement of a dipole or a charge displacement if it is to be detected. Thus while both DMTA and DETA can provide similar information about a sample, they can also be used in a complementary fashion, particularly when trying to identify the molecular mechanism of a particular process and in ascertaining whether or not the group is polar. 13.9 Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) In DMTA a small sinusoidal stress is imparted to the sample in the form of a torque, push-pull, or a flexing mode, of angular frequency ο. If the polymer is treated as a classical damped harmonic oscillator, both the elastic modulus and the damping characteristics can be obtained. Elastic materials convert mechanical work into potential energy which is recoverable; for example an ideal spring, if deformed by a stress, stores the energy and uses it to recover its original shape after removal of the stress. No energy is converted into heat during the cycle and so no damping is experienced. Liquids on the other hand flow if subjected to a stress; they do not store the energy but dissipate it almost entirely as heat and thus possess high damping characteristics. Viscoelastic polymers exhibit both elastic and damping behaviour. Hence if a sinusoidal stress is applied to a linear viscoelastic material, the resulting stress will also be sinusoidal, but will be out of phase when there is energy dissipation or damping in the polymer. Harmonic motion of a Maxwell element. The application of a sinusoidal stress to a Maxwell element produces a strain with the same frequency as, but out of phase with, the stress. This can be represented schematically in figure 13.10 where ο is the phase angle between the stress and the strain. The resulting strain can be described in the terms of its angular frequency ο and the maximum amplitude Ε o using complex notation, by  where , the frequency is v and . The relation between the alternating   stress and strain is written as  where  is the frequency dependent complex dynamic modulus defined by  This shows that  is composed of two frequency dependent components; is the real part in phase with the strain called the storage modulus, and  is the loss modulus defined as the ratio of the component 90° out of phase with the stress to the stress itself. Hence  measures the amount of stored energy and , sometimes called the imaginary part, is actually a real quantity measuring the amount of energy dissipated by the material. The response is often expressed as a complex dynamic compliance  especially if a generalized Voigt model is used. For a Maxwell model  In more realistic terms, there is a distribution of relaxation times and a continuous distribution function can be derived, if required. The damping in the system or the energy loss per cycle can be measured from the ‘loss tangent’ tan δ. This is a measure of the internal friction and is related to the complex moduli by  The onset of molecular motion in a polymer sample is reflected in the behaviour of E′ and E′′. A schematic diagram (figure 13.11) of the variation of E′ and E′′ as a function of ο, assuming only a single value for τ in the model, shows that a maximum in the loss angle is observed where . This represents a transition point such as T g , T m or   some other region where significant molecular motion occurs in the sample. The maximum is characteristic of the dynamic method as the creep and relaxation techniques merely show a change in the modulus level. 13.10 Experimental methods There are three main experimental approaches for measuring the dynamic mechanical properties of a sample, (a) free vibration, (b) forced vibration — resonance, (c) forced vibration — non-resonance . The mechanical response is usually determined at low frequencies and over as wide a temperature range as possible and examples of each are described in the following section. TORSIONAL PENDULUM — FREE VIBRATION A study of the mechanical damping and shear modulus under free vibration can be made using a torsional pendulum. The specimen is firmly fixed at one end and the other end is clamped to a disc, with a large moment of inertia, which can move freely. As the polymer sample should not be under a tensile stress, the suspension wire supporting the disc is passed over a pulley and the weight of the disc and sample are counterbalanced by loading the end. If the disc is subjected to an angular displacement and then released, the sample will twist backwards and forwards about the vertical axis. The oscillations stimulated in the sample are picked up by an arm attached to the rigidly fixed end held in torsion bars, and transmitted to a recorder by a linear variable differential transformer. The sample movements are traced as a series of oscillations whose frequency is a function of the physical state of the sample. The period of oscillation P is taken as the distance between adjacent maxima or minima and the amplitude A is a measure of the height from one minimum to the preceding maximum. The exponential decay of the amplitude along the axis provides an indication of the mechanical   damping. At a temperature  the sample absorbs most of the energy and damping is high whereas at a much lower temperature  the material tends to store the energy and mechanical damping is considerably lower. A quantitative measure of the damping is provided by the logarithmic decrement defined as the logarithmic decrease in amplitude per cycle. It is calculated from the ratio of amplitudes of any two successive oscillations using the relation  The shear modulus can also be derived from the data, being inversely proportional to the square of the period , where K is a factor depending on the shape and the size of the sample and I is the polar moment of inertia. The method can cover the complete range of moduli encountered in polymeric systems but is confined to a relatively narrow frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz. VIBRATING REED RESONANCE For resonance forced vibration measurements a sample in the form of a thin strip is clamped firmly at one end leaving the other end free. The clamped end of the system is then vibrated laterally at a given frequency v and the amplitude of the vibration induced at the free end of the sample is recorded. A range of frequencies wide enough to ensure that it encompasses the resonant frequency of the sample v r is then examined. The resonant frequency is detected as the maximum of a graph of amplitude against frequency. The results provide information on the elastic modulus E since it is related to the square of the resonance frequency by    where c is a numerical constant, L is the free length of the sample, D is its thickness, and ρ is the sample density. If the amplitudes are expressed as ratios of the amplitude to the maximum amplitude, then damping is measured from the half-width h of the curve, i.e.  This technique is not as useful as the torsional pendulum but covers the higher frequency range 10 to 103 Hz. FORCED VIBRATION NON-RESONANCE Several types of instrument can be used for this type of test, and these are usually limited to measurements on rigid polymers or rubbers. One such instrument is shown in the block diagram 13.14. The sample C is attached firmly at each end to a strain gauge; one of these is a force transducer measuring the applied sinusoidal force and the other records the sample deformation. A sinusoidal tensile stress of a given frequency can be generated in the vibrator A and if the electrical vectors from the force and displacement are represented by  and  then by satisfying the condition  the tangent of the phase angle δ between the stress and the strain may be calculated from    This operation of adjustment followed by subtraction of the electrical vectors is performed directly in the recording circuit. The complex elastic modulus E * is given by  where F is the amplitude of the tensile force, A is the sample cross-sectional area, L is the sample length, and ΔL is the amplitude of elongation. Tensile storage and loss moduli E′ and E′′ follow from  and . A second version now widely used for these measurements is the Polymer Laboratories DMTA instrument and a schematic diagram of the working head is shown in figure 13.15. Several damping arrangements are available for the sample so that measurements may be made in the bending, shear, or tensile, modes. In the bending mode the sample, in the form of a small bar, is clamped firmly at both   ends and the central point is vibrated by means of a ceramic drive shaft. This can be driven at frequencies selected from the range 0.01 to 200 Hz. The applied stress is proportional to the a.c. current fed to the drive shaft and the strain is detected using a transducer that measures the displacement of the drive clamp. Temperature can be controlled over the range 120 to 770 K, either isothermally or more normally by ramping up and down at various fixed rates. 13.11 Correlation of mechanical damping terms The several practical methods described express the damping and moduli in slightly different forms but these can all be interrelated quite simply. In general, one can select a dissipation factor or loss tangent derived from the ratio  or  to represent the energy conversion per cycle. This leads to the equivalent forms   and  To a first approximation it is also possible to write  thereby allowing use of the data from either type of measurement to characterize the sample. It should also be noted that if complex moduli are used the corresponding complex compliances are given by . Moduli can also be related to the viscosity, and  where η is known as the dynamic viscosity. The approximations  and  can be made when damping is low, and the absolute value for the modulus |G| or |E| can be related to the complex components by . A similar expression holds for |G|. 13.12 Dielectric thermal analysis (DETA) Dry polymers are very poor conductors of electricity and can be regarded as insulators. Application of an electric field to a polymer can lead to polarization of the sample, which is a surface effect, but if the polymer contains groups that can act as permanent dipoles then the applied field will cause them to align in the direction of the field. When the electric field is released, the dipoles can relax back into a random orientation, but, due to the frictional resistance experienced by the groups in the bulk polymer this will not be instantaneous. The process of disordering can be characterized by a relaxation time, but may not be easily measured. It is more convenient to apply a sinusoidally varying voltage to the sample and to study the dipole polarization under steady state conditions. In DETA a small alternating electric field is applied to the sample and the electric charge displacement Q is measured by following the current . The complex dielectric permittivity ε * can be measured from the change in amplitude and, if the phase lag between the applied voltage and the outcoming current is determined (see figure 13.16), then ε * can be resolved into the two components ε′, the storage (dielectric   constant) and ε′′, the loss (dielectric loss). The frequencies used in the measurements must now be in the range where orientational polarization of the dipoles in the polymer is active. These frequencies are much higher than used normally for DMTA and typically lie in the range 20 Hz to 100 kHz. While the main variable is temperature, the factors ε′ and ε′′ can be studied as a function of the angular frequency ο, and in the frequency region where there is a relaxation, ε′ decreases as shown in figure 13.17. The magnitude of this decrease  is a measure of the strength of the molecular dipole involved in the relaxation, where ε o is the static dielectric constant related to the actual dipole moment of the polymer and ε∞ is the dielectric constant measured at high frequencies. When the dielectric loss factor is measured at a characteristic frequency ο max and a given temperature, it passes through a maximum when a relaxation occurs, and the dipole   relaxation time , can be obtained. At frequencies above ο max the dipoles cannot move fast enough to follow the alternating field so both ε′ and ε′′ are low. When the frequency is lower than ο max the permanent dipoles can follow the field quite closely and so ε′ is high because the dipoles align easily with each change in polarity; ε′′ on the other hand is low again because now the voltage and the current are approximately 90° out of phase. Dielectric relaxation processes can be described formally by the following relations: and  A useful way of examining the data is to measure the ratio of the two factors, which gives the dielectric loss tangent  Dipolar groups in a polymer coil may not all be able to relax at the same speed because of the variable steric restrictions they may experience, imposed by their environment. This can be caused by the disordered packing of chains in the amorphous glassy phase, and a random distribution of the available free volume, or perhaps even by the random  coil structure of the chain itself causing local environmental changes. The result is that a distribution of relaxation times is to be expected for a given process and this results in a broadening of the dielectric loss peak. Thus, the more mobile a dipolar group, the easier it is for it to follow the electric field up to higher frequencies, whereas the less mobile groups can only orient at lower frequencies. 13.13 Comparison between DMTA and DETA Data from mechanical and dielectric measurements can be related, certainly in a qualitative, if not always in a quantitative way. Formally, the dielectric constant  can be regarded as the equivalent of the mechanical compliance , rather than the modulus, and this highlights the fact that mechanical techniques measure the ability of the system to resist movement, whereas the dielectric approach is a measurement of the ability of the system to move, given that the groups involved must also be dipolar. Interestingly, the dielectric loss  appears to match the loss modulus  more closely than the loss compliance when data are compared for the same system. Both techniques respond in a similar fashion to a change in the frequency of the measurement. When the frequency is increased, the transitions and relaxations that are observed in a sample appear at higher temperatures. This is illustrated from work on poly (ethylene terephthalate) where the loss peak representing the glass transition has been measured by both DMTA and DETA at several frequencies between 0.01 Hz and 100 kHz (figure 13.18). The maximum of this loss peak  is seen to move from a   temperature of about 360 K (0.01 Hz) to about 400 K (100 kHz), which is an increase of 40 K over a frequency change of seven orders of magnitude. This is close to the rule of thumb that the temperature for the maximum of a loss peak  (or a relaxation process) will change by approximately 7 K for each decade of change in frequency. This type of measurement can be used to estimate the activation energy  for a transition or relaxation process, if the frequency v, at T max is expressed as a function of reciprocal temperature according to the relation  Data plotted using equation (13.33) for the β-relaxation process in a series of poly(alkylmethacrylate)s are shown in figure 13.19. Both techniques have been used and separately give good straight lines with the same slope, but the fact that the lines do not overlap precisely indicates that the measurements may not be exactly equivalent. The results from DMTA and DETA can be used in a complementary manner to distinguish between relaxations involving polar and non polar units relaxing in the polymeric system. Thus if the response of poly (ethylene terephthalate) to both DMTA and DETA is examined, two major loss peaks can be identified in each, as seen in figure 13.20. The high temperature loss peak (α-peak) can be assigned to the glass transition and this can be confirmed by d.s.c. measurements. There is a second loss (β-relaxation) which appears at lower temperatures and suggests that there is a relaxation process active in the glassy state. It is not immediately obvious which group is responsible for this process, but it is active both mechanically and dielectrically. Examination of the polymer structures suggests that the relaxation in the glass could involve libration of the phenyl ring, motion of the oxycarbonyl unit or rearrangement of the (-O-C-C-O-) unit. From the spectra it can be seen that the intensity of the β-peak relative to the α-peak is much stronger in the dielectric response compared with   the mechanical measurements. This suggests that the group undergoing relaxation is associated with a dipole moment and thus rules out the phenyl ring libration as a likely process. This does not give irrefutable evidence of the participation of the oxycarbonyl unit but it does point in this direction. 13.14 Time-temperature superposition principle A curve of the logarithm of the modulus against time and temperature is shown in figure 13.21. This provides a particularly useful description of the behaviour of a polymer and allows one to estimate, among other things, either the relaxation or retardation spectrum. The practical time scale for most stress-relaxation measurements ranges from 10 1 to 10 6 s but a wider range of temperature is desirable. Such a range can be covered relatively easily by making use of the observation, first made by Leaderman, that for viscoelastic materials time is equivalent to temperature. A composite isothermal curve covering the required extensive time scale can then be constructed from data collected at different temperatures. This is accomplished by translation of the small curves along the log t axis until they are all superimposed to form a large composite curve. The technique can be illustrated using data for polyisobutylene at several temperatures. An arbitrary temperature T o is first chosen to serve as a reference which in the present case   is 298 K. As values of the relaxation modulus  have been measured at widely differing temperatures, they must be corrected for changes in the sample density with temperature to give a reduced modulus, where ρ and ρ o are the polymer densities at T and T o respectively. This correction is small and can often be neglected. Each curve of reduced modulus is shifted with respect to the curve at T o until all fit together forming one master curve. The curve obtained at each temperature is shifted by an amount  The parameter a τ is the shift factor and is positive if the movement of the curve is to the left of the reference and negative for a move to the right. The shift factor is a function of temperature only and decreases with increasing temperature, it is, of course, unity at T o . The superposition principle can also be applied to creep data. Curves exhibiting the creep behaviour of polymers at different temperatures can be compared by plotting  against log t. This reduces all the curves at various temperatures to the same shape but displaced along the log t axis. Superposition to form a master curve is readily achieved by movement along the log t axis, where the shift factor a τ has the same characteristics as for the relaxation data. This shift factor has also been defined as the ratio of relaxation or retardation times at the temperatures T and T o i.e.  and is related to the viscosities. If the viscosities obey the Arrhenius equation, then by neglecting the correction factor, we can express a τ in an exponential form as  or  where b is a constant. This equation is very similar in form to the WLF equation, For polyisobutylene, the shift factor a τ can be predicted if  is used with  and . As outlined in chapter 12, the reference temperature is often chosen to be T g with  and , from which a τ can be calculated for various amorphous polymers. The superposition principle can be used to predict the creep and relaxation behaviour at any temperature if some results are already available, with the proviso that the most reliable predictions can be made for interpolated temperatures rather than long extrapolations. The principle can also be applied to dielectric data which can be shifted either along the temperature or the frequency axis. An example of the latter type of shift is shown in    figure 13.22, where instead of time dependence measurements the frequency dependence of the β-relaxation in poly (vinyl acetate) has been studied at fixed temperatures in the range 212 to 266 K. A master curve can be constructed for this relaxation region by plotting  against , where the ‘max’ subscript refers to the peak maximum at each experimental temperature. 13.15 A molecular theory for viscoelasticity So far the interpretation of viscoelastic behaviour has been largely phenomenological, relying on the application of mechanical models to aid the elucidation of the observed phenomena. These are, at best, no more than useful physical aids to illustrate the mechanical response and suffer from the disadvantage that a given process may be described in this way using more than one arrangement of springs and dashpots. In an attempt to gain a deeper understanding on a molecular level, Rouse, Zimm, Bueche, and others have attempted to formulate a theory of polymer viscoelasticity based on a chain model consisting of a series of sub-units. Each sub-unit is assumed to behave like an entropy spring and is expected to be large enough to realize a Gaussian distribution of segments (i.e.> 50 carbon atoms). This approach, although still somewhat restrictive has led to reasonable predictions of relaxation and retardation spectra. One starts with a single isolated chain and the assumption that it exhibits both viscous and elastic behaviour. If the chain is left undisturbed it will also adopt the most notable conformation or segmental distribution, so that, with the exception of high frequencies, the observed elasticity is predominantly entropic. Thus the application of a stress to the molecule will cause distortion, by altering the equilibrium conformation to a less probable one, resulting in a decrease in the entropy and a corresponding increase in the free energy of the system. When the stress is removed the chain segments will diffuse back to their unstressed positions even though the whole molecule may have changed its spatial position in the meantime. If on the other hand, the stress is maintained, strain relief is sought by converting the excess free energy into heat, thereby stimulating the thermal motion of the segments back to their original positions. Stress relaxation is then said to have occurred. For a chain molecule composed of a large number of segments, movement of the complete molecule depends on the co-operative movement of all the segments, and as stress-relaxation depends on the number of ways the molecule can regain its most probable conformation, each possible co-ordinated movement is treated as a mode of motion with a characteristic relaxation time. For simplicity we can represent the polymer as in figure 13.23. The first mode p = 1 represents translation of the molecule as a whole and has the longest relaxation time τ 1 because the maximum number of co-ordinated segmental movements are involved. The second mode p = 2 corresponds to the movement of the chain ends in opposite directions; for p = 3, both chain ends move in the same   direction, but the centre moves in the opposite direction. Higher modes 4, 5…m follow involving a progressively decreasing degree of co-operation for each succeeding mode and correspondingly lower relaxation times τ p . This means that a single polymer chain possesses a wide distribution of relaxation times. Using this concept, Rouse considered a molecule in dilute solution under sinusoidal shear and derived the relations    where η and η s are the viscosities of the solution and the solvent respectively, n is the number of molecules per unit volume, k is the Boltzmann constant, and ο is the angular frequency of the applied stress which is zero for steady flow. These equations are strictly applicable only to dilute solutions of non-draining monodisperse coils, but can be extended to undiluted polymers above their glass temperature if suitably modified. This becomes necessary when chain entanglements begin to have a significant effect on the relaxation times. The undiluted system is represented as a collection of polymer segments dissolved in a liquid matrix composed of other polymer segments and η s can be replaced by a monomeric frictional coefficient ζ o . This provides a measure of the viscous resistance experienced by a chain and is characteristic of a given polymer at a particular temperature. The continuous relaxation and retardation spectra calculated from the Rouse theory are  and  where  is the unperturbed mean square end-to-end distance of a chain of molar mass M and density ρ containing N monomer units. The equations predict linearity in the plots  and  against  with slopes of-½ and +½ respectively. Comparison with experimental results for poly (methyl acrylate) shows validity only for longer values of the relaxation and retardation times. The Rouse model only pertains to the region covering intermediate τ values. The reason for this lies in the response of a polymer to an alternating stress. At low frequencies Brownian motion can relieve the deformation caused by the stress before the next cycle takes place, but as the frequency increases the conformational change begins to lag behind the stress and energy is not only dissipated but stored as well. Finally at very high frequencies only enough time exists for bond deformation to occur. As it was stipulated that each segment be long enough to obey Gaussian statistics, short relaxation times may not allow a segment sufficient time to rearrange and regain this distribution. Thus the contribution from short segments to the distribution functions tends to be lost and deviations from the theoretical represent departure from ideal Gaussian behaviour. This approach to viscoelastic theory is reasonably successful in the low modulus  regions but it requires considerable modification if the high modulus and rubbery plateau regions are to be described."
ACA ACA-HXH-005 -0.0499999999999999 "Writing your essay or dissertation This chapter looks at how you compose the sentences and paragraphs which make up your essay or dissertation. In particular, we consider two especially important parts of your work: the beginning and the end. The beginning has to create interest and tell the reader what to expect, while the end will form a disproportionate part of the reader's final impression of your essay (in fact, many readers will read the end first, to find out what conclusions you draw). Later sections of the chapter explain how you divide your essay into paragraphs and signal the relationship between them. We end by looking at how you embed other people's words into your own writing, in the form of paraphrase and quotation. 5.1 THE FIRST PARAGRAPH The first paragraph of your essay tells your reader what your essay will be about: what the main focus is and what question(s) you are going to answer. But your first paragraph is also your opportunity to start actively working on those questions. This is true even if the question has been prescribed by someone else (perhaps in an examination); in such cases, you reformulate the question in your first paragraph to demonstrate that you have understood it and can develop arguments from it. Here is an example of a set question: Explain fully the significance of the title of ""The Captain's Doll"" . And this is the beginning of an essay which answers it: The significance of the title of ""The Captain's Doll"" is its use as a central symbol or motif which is the organizing principle for the whole story. Though the doll motif can be applied to several different characters, its central meaning is a representation of that which Lawrence dislikes in relationships between men and women. The essay begins by stating its main point: that the title focuses attention on a multifunctional symbol within the story. But to do this, the writer simply repeats the wording of the question. Instead she or he could have used material from the question to begin the essay with a generalisation (see above, Chapter 3, p. 66), like this: Titles often serve the purpose of focusing attention on a central symbol; and this is certainly true of ""The Captain's Doll"" . Though the doll motif… Just repeating the question tells your examiner nothing about what you know, and takes up time and space. Reworking the question into a related generalisation, on the other hand, shows that you understand something of the complexities it contains. Similarly, as you rework the question into your first sentence you can begin to show that key terms in the question are problematic or vague, or you can suggest what kind of evidence you will draw on to discuss the question. As well as introducing the content of your essay, your first paragraph should also explain its organisation. But don't overdo this by being too overt, as in this opening to an essay (by a non-native speaker) titled ""Lyrical and Epical Genres in Middle English Poetry"" : I shall begin discussing lyrical and epical genres in Middle English poetry with the explanation of both these terms. But before they will be explained it is necessary to consider the term genre. Quoting Burrow… While this beginning is effective in showing organisation, it delays getting into the argument, and could be rewritten in the following way, which both demonstrates organisation less clumsily and gets immediately to the point: Since the terms ""lyrical"" and ""epic"" present special difficulties when used of Middle English works, it is useful to introduce discussion of works of the period with a brief analysis of these two terms. And since the larger concept of ""genre"" , within which they play a part, is also problematic, my discussion of the two terms will be prefaced by a more general discussion of ""genre"" . Interestingly, Burrow's suggestion is that… In its first few lines, the rewritten passage now offers reasons for organising the essay in the way that has been chosen, and so connects the answer more directly with the question. Slightly different problems arise in our next example, though again they are related to the relationship between the various topics being introduced: The ""Sonnet on the Death of Mr Richard West"" contains many half-rhymes and can be split into two groups, the octave and the sestet. The sonnet is an emotional elegy, and the tone is mournful. The author addresses the reader directly. In this passage three topics are introduced: the sonnet's form, its tone and its mode of address. But no link is suggested between them, and it is not yet clear what the point of the essay is. We could accordingly rewrite this opening as: In the ""Sonnet on the Death of Mr Richard West"" , formal qualities of the sonnet (such as its rhyme scheme, division between octave and sestet and mode of address) are moulded to suit the mournful tone of an emotional elegy. In this revised version the individual observations are collected together under a common denominator (labelled ""formal qualities"" ) and are linked to the claimed mood of the poem. Instead of just being presented with a list of topics, we now know the relationship between the topics. A helpful first paragraph, then, offers your reader a ""menu"" of what will follow, while at the same time already beginning on the argument of the essay. But you need to remember that the menu should not be too large (some essays become very front-heavy with preliminaries); and you should ensure that items you have placed on the menu are actually served up to the reader later. Sometimes, the subject areas outlined are impossibly large, given the essay's prescribed length. It is a good test of an opening sentence (or paragraph) to read it aloud, list the topics you think it tells a reader to expect in the essay, and make sure that those topics coincide with your planned contents. Organising your essay in advance changes the process of writing a first paragraph. Advance planning makes it possible to write the essay in sections and put the sections together only at the end — with the result that you do not have to write the sections in the order in which they will finally appear. You can write your first paragraph when you have finished the rest of the essay; and at that point, you will definitely be able to promise what the essay will cover — because you will have already written it. 5.2 THE LAST PARAGRAPH Your reader will pay particular attention to your last paragraph and last sentence, largely because the last section has to bring to a suitable conclusion the various different arguments you have made.  ""A suitable conclusion"" does not mean just repeating your opening sentence. If you begin like this: In this essay, I will argue that Henry James's representations and frequent treatment of women through metaphors as art objects are deeply problematic. You should not end your essay by simply recapitulating: In the foregoing pages, I have shown how Henry James's representations and frequent treatment of women through metaphors as art objects are deeply problematic. Such repetition is simply a reminder, not a conclusion. In a long dissertation it might be justified as a way of helping your reader remember your starting point; in a short essay, however, it is redundant and simply shows that you don't know how to finish. What then would be a ""suitable conclusion"" ? This depends on the aims of the essay, but it might include:— a judgement about which of the competing arguments you have considered in your essay is correct or most persuasive; — an evaluation or assessment of the qualities of a work or writer, based on arguments presented in the essay; — an indication of what consequences follow from what you have shown in your essay. If you want to suggest consequences or implications, try ending by answering these questions: (a) Have you discovered any methods which can now be used to investigate another text or author? (b) Does your argument suggest that we should look again at some other area, which we might now view differently? (c) Can you extend what you have said to other works by the same author, by other authors, or to other works of the same period? (d) Can you make any important general observations, using your whole essay as an illustration or case study? Each of the questions above is worth exploring, especially because final paragraphs and sentences often fall into one of a number of largely unsatisfactory idioms, each with its own way of dealing with ending less as  an opportunity than as an escape. We indicate some of the idioms below. The ""farewell speech""  Avoid the sort of ending used in this essay on ""Genres of the Old English Poetry"" : And in this way we have come to the end of our characterisation of the main genres of the oldest vernacular poetry in Western Europe; poetry which achieved so great variety over the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries. The phrase ""come to the end of our"" suggests a pleasant, shared experience or excursion; and the expression ""oldest vernacular poetry in Western Europe"" calls to mind less the language of analysis or scholarship than that of advertising or publicity (where things are valued because they are the best, the oldest, etc.). These features of the style, coupled with the exclamatory force of ""so"" ( ""so great variety"" ) give an overall effect that the conclusion is a promotional, or uncritically praising, piece of writing, rather than an academic study. Both the intentions and the style of this final sentence are inappropriate. Indecisiveness disguised as fairness Your essay is an argument, and you should present different sides of that argument. It is this argument which your first paragraph promises and to which your last paragraph offers a conclusion. But your conclusion can properly come to a decision on one side, and need not remain balanced (so avoid: ""both sides have their virtues and it is difficult to decide between them"" ). It is perfectly acceptable to draw conclusions of your own, based on the arguments and evidence you have presented. The challenge is to show that you have answered the question but have got there by fair consideration of all positions. Falling over backwards Consider this final sentence from an essay on the element of satire in two Restoration dramatists: Both playwrights succeed in mixing description with analysis which is conveyed in entertaining prose. Here the problem lies in the generality of the terms ""description"" and ""analysis"" , as well as in the anti-climactic phrase ""entertaining prose"" as the  final words of the piece.  ""Entertaining"" is too unspecific a notion, as though you had slipped backwards in the argument after reaching more sophisticated peaks of describing the details of satire. The point of an ending is for the conclusion to look backwards, not to carry the argument backwards. The higher authority When you write an essay you have both the opportunity and the responsibility to state your own views in your own words. It is often tempting to think that some critic you have read can summarise your viewpoint better than you yourself can, and so to end your essay with a quotation from someone else. We talk later in this chapter about the use of other people's words, making the point that one problem with other people's words is that they usually make more sense where they come from than where you put them in your essay. Because your conclusion is so important, you can't risk the slightly different emphases and directions which someone else's words are likely to carry. Because your essay is not identical with theirs, there is little chance that someone else's words will be exactly right as a conclusion to your argument. The disconnected personal opinion Concluding with your own words, however, requires caution, particularly in the handling of personal response. Despite the instruction often given by teachers to emphasise personal involvement towards the end of an essay, you should avoid the sort of over-personalised ending found in this essay: After reading the first paragraph, I didn't expect such an exciting story, but gradually I got more and more involved in the narrative and finally overwhelmed by this splendid spectacle, which I could vividly visualise. This sudden introduction of personal involvement into an essay which was otherwise a dispassionate description is disruptive, and sounds as though the writer really wanted to write much more personally (so indicating a kind of dissatisfaction with the essay as it stands). 5.3 DIVIDING YOUR ESSAY INTO SECTIONS AND PARAGRAPHS Having considered its two most prominent sections — the beginning and the end — we turn now to the structure of the rest — the ""body"" — of the essay. Like a human body, the body of your essay is made up of parts: in this case paragraphs and perhaps numbered or titled sections and subsections. You should gather all your ideas on the same general point into the same section of the essay, so that the essay seems to move forward consistently rather than jump around; you can test whether the essay does have this sort of organisation by working out an appropriate title for each section and paragraph (even though in the final version of the essay your paragraphs at least will lose their titles). Your outline (see above, Chapter 1, pp. 22–4 and Chapter 3, pp. 59–61) will indicate what needs to go into each part of your essay, and enables you to write the different parts in any order you wish. Each topic in the sequence of topics contained in your outline can be translated into a section of your essay. In a short essay the sections will be paragraphs; in a long essay you can combine the paragraphs into titled and or numbered sections and sub-sections. In making these organisational decisions, however, you need to ensure that you do not put in too many markers of structure, which can make the essay seem to be all scaffolding with no building inside. Management of your essay should not overwhelm its content. One major reason for breaking your essay into parts is to signal how each part relates to the whole. Accordingly, as you convert your plan into a series of sections or paragraph topics, you should think carefully about the logical or rhetorical relationship between them: e.g. cause and effect; particularisation and specification; illustration (if so, of what exactly?). Each paragraph should begin with a sentence which relates what comes next to the last point you have made and to the structure of the essay as a whole. This does not need to be done explicitly (e.g. through devices such as ""in the last paragraph, I have argued…"" ), but can be achieved by phrases like ""this x"" , or ""the idea that x"" (where x is a term or phrase used in the previous paragraph). If you do use sub-sections you can number them (1, 1.1, 1.2, etc.) or give them short titles which indicate what they contain. Avoid formal labels, such as ""Introduction"" and ""Conclusion"" , which are redundant; instead you might say something along the lines of ""Introduction: symbolism as an issue in 'The Captain's Doll'"" . A useful test of how effective your section headings are is that it should be possible to string them together into a paraphrase of what the essay says. Your reader knows what is in a section because it has a title. A paragraph, on the other hand, has its main point or direction indicated in the opening sentence, which is sometimes called a TOPIC SENTENCE. (Sometimes the closing sentence performs a similar role.) It can be useful practice to read through the first sentences of paragraphs which make up a published essay, to see how much work — of summary and of signposting — is being done by these ""topic sentences"" . Paragraphs do not function identically in all languages and cultures, however. So paragraphing may present some bilingual writers working in a second language with greater difficulties than writers whose experience is confined to the language and culture in which they are writing. Typically in English a paragraph is unified by the fact that it brings together material around a single point or topic indicated in the first sentence. One way of doing this is to structure your paragraph as: First sentence (topic sentence), makes the main claim of the paragraph (and tries also to link the paragraph with what came before) + subsequent sentences: justify or illustrate the claim; + final sentence: sums up the paragraph (and perhaps tries also to link the paragraph with what will come next). This basic pattern is illustrated by the following, complete four-sentence paragraph (here split into parts and with sentence numbers added). Topic sentence (which makes the main claim of the paragraph):(1) In Chapter 2 Fitzgerald introduces one of the most important patterns of the novel: the ""waste land motif"" . Subsequent sentences (which justify or illustrate the claim):(2) Nothing in the book emphasises the corruption of the American dream more than this image of ""the valley of ashes"" . (3) In 1922 T.S. Eliot published his highly influential poem, ""The Waste Land"" , in which he described Western civilisation in terms of decay and desperation. Final sentence (which sums up the paragraph):(4) In The Great Gatsby Fitzgerald picks up the theme: the valley of ashes is the general locale, all the characters of the story have to pass through it. Sentence (1) introduces the topic of the paragraph: the functioning of the ""waste land motif"" in the organisation of The Great Gatsby. Sentence (2) then offers a meaning for the motif: a critique of the corruption of the American dream. Sentence (3) opens with an apparent change of topic, but implicitly connects the new topic with the already established topic of  the paragraph in a thematic parallel — to be found in T.S. Eliot's concern with ""decay and desperation"" — which also provides a source for the name of the motif, the ""waste land motif"" . Finally, in sentence (4) the parallel between Eliot and Fitzgerald is drawn explicitly, and the way the motif works in the novel is explained, so completing a miniature demonstration of what was promised in the paragraph's opening, topic sentence. A short essay covering four A4 pages (about 1,200 words) might well be divided into about eight paragraphs. Too few paragraphs can make the essay difficult to follow, both visually and conceptually, and suggests that it may not have an underlying argument structure at all. If the paragraphs are consistently very short, on the other hand (e.g. just one or two sentences), then the subdivisions being made become too complicated for a more general, structural image of the essay to be deduced, which defeats the point of having paragraphs at all. In general terms, a paragraph should have several sentences, and might cover about half a page of A4 (about 100 to 150 words). 5.4 SIGNPOSTING AND CONNECTIVES It is not only headings and topic sentences at the beginning of paragraphs which signal the directions in which an essay is progressing, however. Most sentences in written prose are explicitly linked with the sentence which precedes them, producing an overall effect of COHESION. Consider this brief passage, from an essay by a non-native speaker (numbers have been added to identify sentences):[1]One of the functions of a literary work is to pass on some crucial truths or information, give some didactic indications, or convince the reader of some general laws. [2]The dream vision convention was employed by the Middle English writers for such reasons;[3]and it enjoyed great popularity. [4]Discovering this literary phenomenon, we should realise that the contemporary reader of Middle English lived in a different social and cultural reality from ours. [5]So the dream vision must have had a tremendous impact on his perception of the world. Notice that this paragraph is not only held together by the sort of unity, or development of ideas, that we described in the Great Gatsby example above. We can also identify a series of formal markers of connection between the respective sentences. Sentence (2) is connected to (1), for instance, by the phrase ""for such reasons"" , which refers back to the reasons  listed in (1), as well as by the fact that the ""dream vision convention"" is recognisable as an aspect of ""a literary work"" referred to in (1). Sentence (3) is linked to (2) by the additive connective ""and"" , as well as by the fact that ""it"" refers back to ""dream vision convention"" . Sentence (4) is connected with (3) by the word ""this"" , which again refers to ""dream vision convention"" , as well as by the repetition of ""Middle English"" . Sentence (5) connects with (4) because of a number of features: the repetition of ""dream vision"" ; the logical connection indicated by ""so"" ; the connection in meaning between ""world"" and the phrase ""social and cultural reality"" ; and by the fact that ""his"" refers back to the ""contemporary reader"" . What is significant about formal markers of this kind is that they achieve two related effects in academic writing (as in discourse more generally). Firstly, they bind a piece of writing together as a single entity, giving it a connectedness that makes it read as a whole rather than as a string of separate jottings. Secondly, many of the markers signal specific — often logical — relationships between one sentence and another (as ""so"" does in the passage above); such markers control the progression of your writing from idea to idea. For this reason it is important in essay-writing to learn how to handle markers of cohesion, and to sensitise yourself to the underlying relations of meaning they signal. The formal markers of connectedness described above indicate in general that one statement is about to be amplified, supported or qualified by, or alternatively contrasted with, the next statement. There are a range of signals which can be used in this way. Each indicates quite specifically how a following statement will build on the preceding one, and we list some of them in the grid on the following pages. Read along the top of the grid to see kinds of transition, and down the left-hand side for a list of common connective expressions. It is a good test of an essay's cohesion to work through a draft underlining all its cohesive devices, perhaps using the list we provide here. Cohesive markers are not always necessary, but where you find sentences without evident markers, it may be useful to inspect them closely to be certain that the relationship with the preceding sentence is sufficiently clear. Do not think, though, that simply because you have inserted cohesive devices the logical or rhetorical relationships of your essay are therefore adequately constructed. It is possible to use cohesive markers which are incompatible with the sentences they are supposed to link; the resulting effect is one of a cohesive text which remains incoherent. Consider in this light the following example: It is unlikely that Shakespeare or the majority of writers in construction of their work imagined the twentieth-century reader or considered the possibility that the reader would be of another race or colour than his own (the exception to this assumption can be found in later twentieth-century writers). However, Shakespeare wrote ""Othello"" . Notice here the slight oddity of ""however"" . It is clear that an element of contrast is intended, with a meaning something like""in writing Othello, Shakespeare becomes an exception, and so stands in contrast to other writers'. But the effect of ""however"" here does not focus the contrast in quite this way. Rather, ""however"" creates a contrast concerning the idea of a writer foreseeing the effect on later audiences — something which pulls the essay in a different direction from one which might create the expectation that Othello would be introduced. Alongside the sorts of connective listed above, other kinds of link can also be useful. Sometimes a DISJUNCT can be used, a word or phrase which tells your reader what your attitude or degree of commitment is towards the material you present. Disjuncts act as ways of indicating your evaluation of someone else's view which you are representing. hearsay disjuncts:(allegedly, reportedly, etc.)  ""Reportedly, Yeats was particularly fond of this poem…""  evidential disjuncts:(clearly, obviously, etc.)  ""Clearly it would be rash to assume that Shakespeare knew of this earlier version.""  Less common, but sometimes useful, are: attitudinal disjuncts:(unfortunately, sadly, luckily, etc.)  ""Sadly, this was the last novel Hardy was to write…""  Note, however, that attitudinal disjuncts can sometimes have an odd effect on the register of your essay, and are therefore less easily incorporated. As well as holding your text together, cohesive markers and disjuncts are tools for managing your essay. You need to stand back from what you write and explicitly present it to your reader, commenting directly on its organisation, rather than just on the ideas it contains. By referring to your essay in this way, you can direct your reader to specific parts of it, perhaps for emphasis; and you can comment on and mediate your material. MEDIATION is the process of acting as a go-between, or guide. Mediating devices include phrases like, ""as I have shown above"" , ""so far I have tried to argue that"" , ""it may be helpful here to distinguish between"" , ""in this section"" , ""in my introductory paragraph"" , etc. They also include brief summaries of what has gone before, or even direct repetition of key  points, though this must be clearly for the benefit of the reader, not just to fill up space. Over-use of such mediating devices is unwise, especially where they involve direct repetition. But in our experience, this kind of metacommentary in essays at all levels (from ""A"" level through to PhD writing) tends to be under-used; readers are left to infer connections and linkages for themselves, and the effectiveness of sections of argument is as a result often significantly reduced. Generally what is needed is far greater signalling of what is going on in an essay, and more explicit management of the material presented. 5.5 USING OTHER PEOPLE'S WORDS (QUOTATION AND PARAPHRASE) In writing a literary essay, you will almost certainly at some point want to incorporate someone else's words. This is not only because quotation contributes to an appropriate ""literary critical"" register (for this dubious reason, quotations are often believed to be ""compulsory in essays"" ); it is also because your essays are largely about language (both the language of the literary texts you are analysing and also the language of critical works about them), so quotation is the main way of presenting essential data. You can either quote or paraphrase literary texts; and the same is true of critical analyses. The differences between quotation and paraphrase can be seen in the following contrasting examples: Quotation ""One of the most striking things about detective fiction"" , Patricia Craig argues in her critical introduction to English detective stories, ""is the ease with which it accommodates all kinds of topical ideologies.""  Paraphrase (or summary) It is among the most striking features of detective fiction, Patricia Craig points out, that all kinds of topical ideologies are easily accommodated within it. Mixture of paraphrase and quotation One of the most striking features of detective fiction, as Patricia Craig points out, is the way in which it ""accommodates all kinds of topical ideologies"" . The most obvious difference between quotation and paraphrase in these examples is the punctuation which separates a quotation from the surrounding material. Notice that the verbs of reporting are shared: ""argues"" , ""suggests"" , ""points out"" , etc., can be used with quotation or with paraphrase (though only in paraphrase is the reporting verb phrase commonly preceded with ""as"" and followed by ""that"" ). A paraphrase usually substantially changes the language of the original, because all that matters is that the idea is conveyed. Normally you would paraphrase rather than quote, because this is a way of rewriting the relevant material in a way which assimilates it into your essay (rather than, as with a quotation, leaving it sticking out because of its different style). But you should use a quotation if the language of the original is itself important. When you put a quotation in your essay you should do several things with it:— Identify where the quotation comes from, e.g. the author and work: as Woolf suggests in The Common Reader, ""[QUOTE]"" . Early in the essay, Addison refers to this phenomenon as ""[QUOTE]"" . — Tell the reader something about the context from which the quotation was taken, to indicate the background against which the quotation is being used. Sometimes this specification of context will be just a phrase, such as: In the course of a description of Henchard late in the novel, Hardy says, ""[QUOTE]"" . — Add a commentary or gloss, clarifying the relevance of the quotation to your argument. Since quoted material can be read in many different ways, you need to ensure that the particular contribution the quotation makes to your argument is made explicit. Take special care with long quoted passages (more than a couple of sentences or more than a few lines of a poem), as a lengthy quotation which is not then followed by detailed analysis and discussion is probably being used (illegitimately) as a way of replacing rather than supporting your argument; you should guide your readers through the significance of what you have selected for their attention. Literary essays typically follow a simple set of conventions governing the presentation of quotations. In general, short quotations in prose (up to about forty to fifty words) are incorporated in the body of the text, enclosed within single quotation marks. (Some systems recommend double quotation marks; either will be acceptable, as long as you are consistent.) Longer prose quotations are indented as a whole by about half an inch from the left margin of the rest of the text, and should not have quotation marks. Quotations in verse should be indented, like long quotations, and laid out as closely as possible to the original. All quoted material should follow the spelling and punctuation of the source edition. If you omit words from a quotation, indicate the omission by the use of three points (…), allowing a blank space on either side. (This is known as an ELLIPSIS.) Any editorial insertions you make within a quotation should be enclosed within square brackets [], as in: This tendency for the image of war to be distorted [my italics]has the effect of…encouraging unjustifiable patriotism. 5.6 INDICATING WHERE SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEAS WORDS COME FROM When you use someone else's ideas or words, you need to say where they come from. Traditionally it was the practice to provide a footnote for every reference made in an essay, whether for a quotation or for a paraphrase. In many cases, this loads down an essay with so many notes that it becomes difficult to read. For this reason, the footnote-reference system has been widely displaced by other accepted techniques, such as the system which we now describe, and which we would recommend. In the Harvard system (often referred to as the ""author—date"" style), references to a particular work are made in the form of a parenthesis, giving the author's name, the date of the publication referred to or quoted from and the relevant page number(s). This system works effectively, so long as the work in question can be clearly identified in the booklist or bibliography attached to the essay or dissertation (for details, see below, Chapter 7, pp. 134–5). Where there may be ambiguity, because two works exist that were published by the same author in the same year, the two works can be labelled (a) and (b), as in, Kachru 1982(a) and Kachru 1982(b). Note that for a book written by more than two people your textual reference can normally just give the first of the names, followed by ""et al.""  to stand for the other people's names. Here are some examples of typical references that might occur in the body of your essay:(Belsey 1980)(= a general reference to the whole work) (Belsey 1980, 17–21)(= a reference to pp. 17–21 of the work cited) (Sir Gawain and the Green Knight C14)(= a reference to an anonymous work, for which the title rather than an author is given — the date here means fourteenth century.) Note also that when you cite standard works, such as classical, medieval, scriptural or liturgical works, references should follow the numbered divisions and subdivisions of the text: Od, III, 28 = Odyssey, Book III, line 28. What we have been outlining here is a simple version of the Harvard system of ""author—date"" . Other established systems for presenting references include the Chicago system (the style of the Chicago University Press) and the MHRA system (the style of the Modern Humanities Research Association). In quite a lot of professional academic writing, the various systems are mixed together, despite the fact that most journals seek to adopt a consistent policy and insist on receiving manuscripts which follow a specified system. In most work you do, it is not especially important which style you use (unless you are required to use a particular system by your teacher or institution). What matters is that you are consistent. Although they are important, you should not let technicalities in presenting references divert you away from the crucial tasks of organising and writing your essay. For ""A"" level and undergraduate essays, in most cases, it is sufficient simply to underline titles of books, journals and long poems, and to enclose the titles of articles, short stories, short poems and individual essays in single inverted commas. You should identify sources for quotations, either by the ""author—date"" system with a suitable bibliography or by individual footnotes. Bear in mind that presentational matters are for the convenience of your reader, who will want to be able to check easily on the materials you have used. In writing dissertations and postgraduate theses, on the other hand, it is necessary to explore — and follow — established academic conventions more fully. Among the best places to look for guidance are the relevant manuals themselves (see our Booklist at the end of this book). Differences between the three main systems in use mainly concern punctuation, use of parentheses and the order of elements which must be cited; but while these may seem small discrepancies, it is one part of the process of research to assess at some point the different conventions governing the listing and presentation of sources, and to present work accurately according to whatever set of conventions you are following. 5.7 PLAGIARISM Whether you quote or paraphrase, it is important that your essay distinguishes clearly between your own words — your own voice, as we have described it above — and those words and ideas you are embedding in your work which originate elsewhere. Failing to make this distinction is called PLAGIARISM and must be avoided. Consider, for example, the following beginning to an essay entitled ""Foregrounding in King Lear"" : In its most general interpretation, the word ""style"" has a fairly uncontroversial meaning: it refers to the way in which language is used in a given context, by a particular person, for a certain purpose. To make it clear I have to adopt the Swiss linguist Saussure's theory which distinguishes between ""langue"" and ""parole"" .  ""Langue"" is the code or system of rules common to speakers of a language like English.  ""Parole"" is the particular uses of this system, or selections from the system, which the speaker or writer makes on this or that occasion. These two aspects lead to defining stylistics, since it is the main concern of my study, as follows: Stylistics, as Leech and Short point out (1981, p. 13), can be simply defined as the study of a style which is an exercise in describing what use is made of the language. These sentences from a student essay are almost all taken from Leech and Short's textbook Style in Fiction (1981). Because they are copied from it directly (with only minor changes), they make sense as individual sentences; but they do not connect together, because they come from different places in the original book. The first paragraph, for example, comes from p. 10 and the second from p. 13; and all the connections Leech and Short make between these pages have been lost, with the result that it is not clear how the first paragraph leads to the second paragraph. Moreover, because the textbook had a different purpose from the essay, it isn't clear how the material taken from the textbook is relevant to the essay's topic of foregrounding in King Lear. This is a general problem with copying or paraphrasing other people's work: your goals are different from theirs, and so the structure of your argument will also be different. The words of someone else's arguments are very unlikely just to fit straight into and so create a structure and argument for your own essay. A related problem with copying other people's arguments can be seen by comparing an excerpt from a plagiarised text (a) with the essay version derived from it (b):(a) Stylistics, simply defined as the (linguistic) study of style, is rarely undertaken for its own sake, simply as an exercise in describing what use is made of language. (b) Stylistics, as Leech and Short point out (1981, p.13), can be simply defined as the study of a style which is an exercise in describing what use is made of the language. In this case, the writer's revisions have turned the meaning of the original into its opposite: the original (a) says that stylistics is rarely an exercise in describing what use is made of language; but the revision (b) says that stylistics should be defined as an exercise in describing what use is made of language. This (almost certainly unintended) result is a consequence of the writer relying on other people to state ideas rather than trying to understand and restate them in her or his own voice. In general, if you can't restate someone else's ideas in your own words, it is likely that you do not yet understand them sufficiently to be able to make appropriate use of them. The writer of this extract may have felt that she or he was paraphrasing rather than plagiarising, and might point to the reference made in the extract to Leech and Short as evidence that she or he was not being dishonest. Nevertheless, the rewritten version conforms so closely to the original, with just isolated words changed, that it cannot reasonably be called a paraphrase. Either no words should have been changed and the original should have been presented as a quotation, or the original should have been rewritten as a paraphrase (in both cases, acknowledging that the whole passage comes from the textbook, something the extract above from ""Foregrounding in King Lear"" doesn't do). Plagiarism often arises accidentally. For example, you may have copied directly from a book into your notes, then forgotten that your notes are not your own original work, and so incorporated them directly into your essay. And plagiarism is often the result of an admiration for the wording of the original — a feeling that such ideas could not be put better. But if you really feel this, it is usually appropriate to quote the original, rather than incorporate its words into your essay as though they are your own. 5.8 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter, we have shown how you can overcome many of the local difficulties of putting the words and sentences of your essay together, including the special difficulties presented by the opening and  closing passages. We have suggested techniques for creating continuity through the different sections of your essay, by linking together and signposting for a reader the various points you make. Signposting is important in many aspects of essay-writing: in showing your reader where you have got to, how your paragraphs connect together and which words are your own and which are quoted. Specific suggestions * Take special care with your first paragraph. Tell your reader what questions you are going to answer and don't make promises you can't keep (see pp. 92–4). * Take special care with your last paragraph. Use it as a way of bringing the argument of your essay to a conclusion. Read the first paragraph again, but don't copy it into your last paragraph. Don't be grandiose, banal or over-personal, and don't normally end with a quotation from someone else (see pp. 95–7). * Use topic sentences at the beginning (and sometimes also at the end) of paragraphs (see p. 99). * Divide your essay into sections, but don't make the sections too small (see p. 100). * Use cohesive markers, but don't expect them to create connections between unconnectable material (see pp. 100–4). * Get into the habit of standing back from your essay so that you can comment on it for the benefit of your reader (see p. 104). * Avoid using long quotations unless really necessary (see p. 106). * Say where quotations come from and explain what they are doing in your essay (see pp. 107–8). * Either rewrite thoroughly or quote exactly: in between, you are in danger of plagiarism (see pp. 109–10). Exercises (1) The following is a quotation from a book by Christopher Norris called Deconstruction: Theory and Practice (first published by Methuen, in London, in 1982). To present ""deconstruction"" as if it were a method, a system or a settled body of ideas would be to falsify its nature and lay oneself open to charges of reductive misunderstanding. Imagine that you are writing an essay, and want to refer to what Norris says about deconstruction. Write out a version of this quotation which is a  paraphrase, and another version which is a mixture of paraphrase and quotation. (see p. 105). Make sure that your text makes it clear where the quotation comes from (see pp. 107–8). (2) The following passage is the beginning of an exam essay on the development of the modern novel. Drawing on our discussion of paragraph organisation in general, and opening paragraphs in particular (pp. 92–4), revise the passage in ways that present to best effect its main points. As you do so, try as far as possible to keep to the basic sense of the passage. The traditional novel writers like Jane Austen are essentially objective and descriptive, Jane Austen for example describes events and people in a basic narrative style, she has very little involvement with any kind of thought life; the actions made dictate the novel almost completely. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is the first English modernist novel, it was written at the break of the century, a time of great change and movement (for example, electricity, airplanes, telephone were all invented, democracy and freud emerged.) Writers at this time were exploring the new social and material world in which they lived. The fundamental difference between the traditional novel and this the new novel is that now the style is analytical and psychological. Novels involve thoughtlifes and motives, feelings and attitudes. T.S.Eliot for example wrote a series of poems about the disillusionment of modern life, these poems are a comment on the repition of day to day life in the city."
ACA ACA-J7G-001 -0.28 "Deixis and the poetic persona Keith Green Sheffield City Polytechnic, UK Abstract This article examines the function of deixis in a specific literary genre, the lyric poem. In the opening sections, an attempt to define deixis is made and a methodology for analysis for texts in general is proposed. Deixis is seen as a fundamental element of human discourse, and a particular discoursal site is isolated where it can be seen operating in a particular way. Theoretical considerations, such as the relation of deixis to semantics and pragmatics, and the various types of deictic meaning, are discussed, and a cline of deictic activity, a point on which any text must function, is described. A possible taxonomy of deictic elements and terms follows, which modifies and builds on previous attempts by linguists such as Levinson (1983). The relation between these elements and terms, and the lyric poem, is then discussed. The final part of the article is an analysis of two poems, Henry Vaughan's ""The retreate"" and Wordsworth's ""Nutting"" . The deixis occurring in the poems is examined in the light of the theories previously discussed. Keywords: anaphora; context; deixis; distal; homophora; indexical; pragmatic; proximal; symbolic; utterance 1 Introduction and aims In this article I intend to shed some light on the behaviour of a specific linguistic phenomenon, deixis, in a specific kind of discourse, the lyric poem. My main aims are to demonstrate a possible methodology for such analysis, and to present a coherent theory of deixis. I shall discuss some theoretical issues, such as the relation of deixis to semantics and pragmatics; the relationship between deixis which occurs in literary and non-literary texts; and the link deixis might be said to make between context-dependency and truth-conditional semantics. Part of my thesis rests upon the belief that if deixis operates in a different way in lyric poetry from the way it does in non-literary discourse, it does so in degree, not in kind. There are no special deictic terms or elements to be found in lyric poetry. Deixis is a fundamental element of human discourse (as Lyons 1977 notes, not all languages have tense, but they do have deixis), and I intend to investigate its behaviour in one particular kind of text. My account of deixis is such that the methodology could be applied to other kinds of discourse, both literary and non-literary. I am able to treat the deixis of literary and non-literary texts in the same way partly through my account of context (see Section 3). 2 What is deixis? Deixis is the encoding in an utterance of the spatio-temporal context and subjective experience of the encoder. It is primarily linked with the speech or discourse event. It is the phenomenon whereby the tripartite relationship between the language system, the encoder's subjectivity and various contextual factors is foregrounded grammatically or lexically. For example, in Levinson's (1983) well-known deictic utterance, Meet me here a week from now with a stick about this big, there are certain words, such as me, here, now and this, which have part of their meaning which is context-sensitive. They also function from the perspective of the encoder or utterer and are thus significantly grammaticalised in the language. The inclusion of the notion of subjectivity in the above definition might seem surprising here, but I am not equating deixis with a concept that stands in rough opposition to objectivity. As Lyons (1982) notes, the word subjectivity in English has some pejorative connotations; but I see it simply as the way in which language makes provision for the expression of attitude and belief. Russell (1940) called deictics (or indexicals) 1 egocentric particulars, and this is because there is a centre of orientation in deixis which is invariably egocentric. The zero-point, or origo, to use Bühler's (1934) terminology, is set by the encoder in relation to the spatio-temporal nature of the utterance. Any utterance relates both to the speaker's ""centre"" and to the surrounding cognitive environment. 2.1 Deixis and use One of the most important aspects of deixis is that it is invariably distinguished by its use. In order to clarify this, I should like to begin by making a distinction between deictic terms and deictic elements. A deictic term is part of a grammatically closed set which includes the personal and demonstrative pronouns, certain adverbials, definite referring expressions and the vocative particle (a fuller taxonomy is presented in Section 5). A deictic element is not a term as such, but some part of the utterance which might be said to be deictic. In other words, there is a syntactic or semantic element which might function deictically. For instance, verbs are not normally deictic in themselves, except for those noted by Fillmore (1971), notably come and go, which encode movement towards and from the origo. Tense generally is a deictic element, however. The verb in a sentence such as The sun shines brightly is not deictic in the sense that the verb to come is, but is nevertheless deictic because it is part of a system which relates specific entities to reference points. But because it is deictic it is context-sensitive, and there are a number of ways of using the utterance The sun shines brightly and a number of contexts in which it might occur. There is no necessary link between tense and time; it is likely in this instance that the use of the present tense is not restricted to a particular time (which is the time of the utterance) but refers rather to a ""general"" present. The progressive form would be a more likely occurrence if an immediate moment is being referred to. If I say one morning while looking out of my window, The sky is blue, then I am using this sentence deictically. If, however, I mean The sky is blue as a general statement — a proposition about a general state of affairs — then I do not use it deictically (I use it generically). Tense, therefore, can be deictic inasmuch as it can be used to encode specific temporal relations with respect to the encoder. We can notice, too, that the deictic aspect of the definite referring expression the sun (the definite article being a deictic term) is contextually ambiguous — I could use it homophorically (the sun, generally) or deictically (the sun at a particular time and place). I must repeat, then, that deixis is distinguished by its use. Deixis has a powerful pragmatic base as most deictic elements and terms can be used non-deictically. Pronouns, for instance, can be used anaphorically and demonstratives can be used in a non-demonstrative way, for example the expressions here and there and this and that. Despite being a closed set of terms linked with a number of functioning elements, deixis lacks a taxonomy of occurrences because of its pragmatic base. Context and use are vital to our understanding of deixis, and this is why the investigation of its behaviour in a particular discourse is relevant. 3 The distinction between semantics and pragmatics So far I have described a closed set of elements and terms which relate specific entities to a reference point — a set which is also determined by use and context. A central question noted by Levinson (1983) is whether the study of deixis belongs to the domain of pragmatics or semantics. This is a rather complex issue, but clearly there are elements of language, notably deictics, which are not accessible to a purely truth-conditional semantics. A substantial chapter on deixis occurs in Levinson's Pragmatics (1983), and still the most thorough analysis occurs in Lyons' Semantics: Volume 2 (1977). It is not possible to state the truth conditions of sentences with certain deictic elements and terms without reference to the deictic function in context. If semantics is modified to take account of deixis, it becomes a context-conditional semantics, and the boundary between semantics and pragmatics becomes very blurred. Attempts by Barwise and Perry (1983) in their formulation of a situation semantics show promising moves to contextualise semantic theory. The core of such analysis is that sentences with deictic elements and terms encode propositions only by virtue of the specific contexts in which they occur. At this point the problem of context itself comes to the fore. 4 The problem of context It is possible to see context functioning in three ways. By context I mean something wider than the co-text of any utterance: In (1) the implication is that the situation of utterance, which is extralinguistic, determines the potential meaning. Thus in my earlier example The sky is blue, only knowledge of the situation of the utterance will enable the decoder to interpret it as either deictic or generic. Point (3) states that certain linguistic elements encode contextual features. These, I suggest, are deictic elements and terms. I propose to reject (1) and fuse (2) and (3). I reject (1) because this cannot take account of the vast range of human communication which does not take place within the canonical situation of utterance — i.e. face-to-face. For (3) we might have: where the sentence S encodes a function f of possible contexts (c) to transform it into an utterance u. Again, sentences only express propositions by virtue of specific contexts and a specific encoder within a deictic field. There is a reciprocity between linguistic elements and possible contexts, and those elements which enable this reciprocal relationship to proceed are deictic. 4.1 Indexical and symbolic Just as the line between semantics and pragmatics is fuzzy, so is that between the indexical and symbolic meanings of deictic terms. The symbolic meaning of a deictic term is its meaning as it functions within the linguistic system. Thus I might be glossed as ""the person writing this sentence"" ; you as ""the addressee/participant in the discourse"" , and so on. I wish to be relatively uncontroversial about these definitions, although I realise the great philosophical problems involved in any description of I for instance.3 The indexical meaning is that which exists when we have ascribed referents to those discourse elements suggested by the symbolic meaning of a term. A very important point is that the symbolic meaning in part determines the range of indexical possibilities, thus accommodating my view of context outlined above. If I point to a particular item in a room and say ""that"" , we can say that the demonstrative encodes distance from the origo, whether actual or mental, and the coincidence of indexical and symbolic meaning is only possible when we know what object is being pointed to. In the discourse of the lyric poem it is unlikely that we can ascribe indexical meaning to symbolic elements of deictic terms. I suggest, however, that the indexical meaning is partly determined by the manifestation of symbolic meaning within certain contexts. Of course there are many discourses existing where we lack clear referents for indexical meanings. Within literary discourses, it seems that lyric poetry is the genre least likely to assist us. In prose fiction, a more dialogic genre, various shifts of deictic centre occur (that is, from character to character) and we are more likely to see deictic terms verified intra-textually — for example , pronominal reference given a full cataphoric form. I want to try to clear away the distinction between two kinds of text, the ""literary"" (or poetic) and the ""non- literary"" , as regards the function of context. Deixis is the most context-specific linguistic element, and it exists and occurs in the most situation-free as well as the most situation-bound utterances. Certain generic atomic propositions may have minimal deictic features, but most utterances contain them. Following Sperber and Wilson (1986), context can be seen as the set of possibilities which exist in the universe of discourse and situation of utterance for the interpretation of that utterance. If we reject the idea that context is situation (although I have accommodated the concept of situation in my definition of context) we can treat deixis in poetry not as a kind of""pseudo-deixis', as some critics such as Culler (1974) have suggested, but simply as deixis framed by a particular genre. Context then becomes paradoxically more metacontextual (as in the work of Sperber and Wilson 1986) and encoded ( ""pointed to"" ) by certain deictic elements. 5 The discourse of lyric poetry I have so far discussed deixis per se and the functions of context. I must now attempt to define the discourse in which the deixis is to be found, for this is the pragmatic frame governing sense-making operations. There is a danger of treating a historical phenomenon (the lyric poem) as sui generis, and that may restrict any absolute definition of the kind of text I shall be examining. I make certain assumptions about the lyric poem, however: The lyric poem, then, is a particular kind of universe of discourse. The environment of the lyric poem must, in consequence, be matched up with the features we note in the analysis. 6 Deictic categories The so-called ""traditional"" categories of deixis are time, place, person, social and discourse. (see Levinson 1983). I propose a new classification as follows: These categories have the advantage of including the more traditional elements while highlighting the egocentric nature of deixis (the origo) and giving prominence to the major deictic category, reference. Both elements and terms are also accommodated in this classification. I shall take these categories one at a time, and simply state what deictic terms or elements occur in them; but it must always be remembered that every item depends on its use within certain contexts and under certain conditions. As I have said, there can be no taxonomy of use. My explanations must necessarily be brief at this stage. 7 The cline of deictic activity The final part of the procedure before analysis can begin is to see these categories of deixis within a particular discourse, operating at a point along a cline of activity. Here I shall draw on the work of Rauh (1983). Rauh sees deixis as functioning between the poles of extralinguistic deixis and non-egocentric deixis. Extralinguistic deixis is that which is accompanied by phenomena such as gestures (this has led Lyons to call the phenomenon, rather oddly ""deixis at its purest"" ). Often the encoder is visible (being within the canonical situation of utterance) and immediately audible and there takes place a kind of indexical reciprocity whereby the specific quality of a deictic expression is only given by the assignment of the extralinguistic referent. The first shift away from this kind of deixis is where the centre of orientation (origo) but not the related objects are part of the canonical situation. This according to Bühler (1934), is where other ""deictic aids' replace"" the finger"". Demonstratives and the definite article are terms whose mobilisation and use would be strongly linked to this kind of deixis. The second shift occurs when both the centre of orientation and the related objects are excluded from the canonical situation. Here the relevant situational context is imagined. This is a type which occurs throughout written discourse. The decoder has to create a cognitive space in which the deictic elements and terms can be realised indexically. Thus we can see that the discourse of lyric poetry is by no means unusual in its mobilisation of deixis. Rauh finally notes a kind of deixis which is not central to my analysis, but which reflects the problems involved in trying to isolate deictic function. He sees the possibility of a non-egocentric deixis operating. This has to do with the relational quality of deixis. Deictic relations are egocentric, but it is possible to annul this relation by expressing a relatum different from the egocentric one. Rauh's example is the prepositional phrase above the car, where the NP the car removes the egocentric element. This may be true, but the car is itself deictically determined. I consider prepositions in prepositional phrases to be non-deictic, as they relate to an internal system in the way that, say, aspect relates to tense. It is possible, however, that some residue of deictic activity exists within such expressions. The expression above the car assumes a shared spatial relatum. 8 An analysis of Henry Vaughan's ""The retreate""  So far I have described deixis as a closed set of items functioning within certain contexts, and seen it functioning along a cline of possible operations. I have isolated a specific discoursal site where deixis can be discerned operating. I want now to look at ""The retreate"" by Henry Vaughan and to examine a small number of its elements and terms in relation to the methodology already described. I have chosen Vaughan because there has already been some analysis of deixis in his poetry — notably by Roger Sell in his article ""The unstable discourse of Henry Vaughan"" (1987). Vaughan is an interesting poet with regard to his use of deixis. His idiosyncratic usage is at once fascinating for analysis and a warning against making unwary generalisations about lyric poetry. The opening line features a definite referring expression with distal demonstrative those. (Demonstratives are described in terms of relative proximity to the encoder: this is proximal, that is distal. Plural forms do not differ in deictic meaning.) Most of the reference in the poem is made through the use of demonstratives, rather than the definite article. The initial clause, ""Happy those early days!"" , plunges us into the middle of a discourse, as much lyric poetry does. There is some syntactic ambiguity in the opening lines — we can read ""when I/Shin"" d ""as a separate clause or as a post-modifier to"" those early dayes'. Because of exclamation mark, and despite the lower case ""w"" , I read the first clause as complete, thus giving it fuller deictic impact. Information after ""those early dayes' must lessen the deictic force of the utterance because it shifts our attention not to some presupposed referent seemingly outside the discourse (what"" early dayes'?) but to something qualified within the text itself. I also assume that there is an ellipted main verb, the past tense copula were, but this is not immediately apparent on a first reading.  ""Early"" is deictic here, but only inasmuch as it sets up an opposition to a notional ""late"" . ""Those early dayes' refers to a latent discourse referent. A demonstrative is used to refer to a temporal aspect. At this stage we do not know whether the ""dayes' are general (which would imply that the missing verb is are) or particular; but we get a clearer picture when we come to the second clause"" when I /Shin ""d"" . 'shin ""d"" encodes past activity, but only in relation to the utterance's internal system of time referencing which has already been set up and controlled by the deictic references of earlier elements. This seems to happen retrospectively, for it is the simple past tense of 'shin ""d"" which enables us to read the deixis of ""those early dayes' in a particular way, in direct relation to 'shin"" d"". The opening of a poem is obviously important because there is no previous discourse through which to interpret it except for the title, but this is not precise enough to enable us to assign the proper indexical meaning to the deictic elements and terms. But what are these ""early dayes' and who is the"" I""of the utterance? In discourse theory, if the conditions specified by any of the co-ordinates (speaker, place, audience, time, etc.) are altered, the contexts are altered. So how does the concept of context function here in relation to the deictic elements and terms which are clearly organising the poem's reference structure? The deictic elements and terms are constantly helping us to sort from possible contexts, helping us to move from symbolic meaning to some kind of reconstructed indexical meaning. A powerful deictic centre is being mobilised without an immediate situation. The poem can be seen to embody a set of expectations or possible worlds. It will further engage in the set of those possible worlds and alter the context depending on the interaction of the conditions which specify the action of the discourse co-ordinates. In ""The retreate"" , deixis is often qualified by further deixis, and these elements are often ""personal"" . When, later in the poem, reference is made to cultural and spatio-temporal elements, such qualification is missing. All the while, the deixis works to orientate our focus. In the early part of the poem there is ambiguity in the functioning of deictic expressions: an initial deictic term such as ""those early dayes' is supplemented with further deictic information"" when I /Shin ""d.""  This recurs in the expression ""this place /Appointed for my second race"" (lines 3–4). Thus Vaughan is assuming a certain amount of shared knowledge on the part of the reader; but because we cannot, naturally, see things from the perspective of his origo, he must also assist the reader in the assignment of indexical or deictic meanings. In the latter part of the poem, however, referring expressions, though still mobilising the demonstrative, are not qualified with further deictic terms. They tend to suggest homophoric or anaphoric reference, although their function is not straightforward.  ""That ancient track"" (line 22) and ""that plaine"" (line 23) are references to the earlier ""journey"" . Although they are followed by two relative clauses (lines 24 and 25), they are not as closely linked syntactically as the earlier examples cited above. The subsequent information is in fact redundant with respect to deictic function. The expression ""That shady City of Palme trees' is more conventionally homophoric; but nevertheless it is metaphorically"" displaced""and encoded through the use of a distal demonstrative. The use of such demonstratives always implies a dual processing effort on the part of the addressee. On the one hand, the demonstrative suggests that the element is known to us — that it is somewhere in the universe of discourse. On the other hand, the demonstrative does not merely give crude emphasis to a referent; it suggests that although the element is ""known"" some extra processing effort must take place in order for it to be accessed. The final demonstrative uses — ""this dust"" and ""that state (I came)"" — reiterate the opposition between the proximal and distal perspectives of the speaker. ""This' is always something that, although proximal, the speaker of the poem wishes to move away from. This backward movement in both time and space is brought to a climax in the final line. Distal elements are huddled into a final phrase which includes the distal demonstrative ""this', the past tense verb"" came "", and"" return "", which is semantically opposed to"" came"". As the poem progresses, we might assume that contextual or latent discourse referents are less likely to be introduced, for we read and interpret in the light of what has gone before — of previous elements in the utterance. This is partly evident in my initial example of the ""backward-looking"" function of the deictic element 'shin ""d"" (line 2), but lyric poetry is also a genre where such referents are continually introduced. I have stressed that we construct a context from the deixis of the text (a context being the set of possibilities which exist in the universe of discourse and situation of utterance for the interpretation of the utterance); but the initial elements of the utterance must be more dense in terms of pragmatic activity. We cannot merely say the poem represents a kind of null context, where context is partly situation of utterance and partly based on previous elements in the discourse. Deictic expressions, certainly in the first part of the poem, are often qualified in a way so as to present the reader with further information; but that information often, too, comprises deictic elements or terms. My first example of this was the opening line. The following are the occurrences of deictic expressions qualified (post-modified) by a deictic element or term Q. The lower-case q represents a referring expression{ REF}embedded in the qualifying element: Three of the above occurrences are in the opening eight lines. The fourth occurs at lines 23–4. In the second and fourth examples: indicates a further qualification (a referring expression) embedded in the initial element, as in: 8.1 Further comments on the deixis of ""The retreate""  Demonstrative reference is clearly an important aspect of the deixis of the poem: it encourages the reader to process the deictic meanings in a specific way. There are only three occurrences of the definite article: ""the black art"" (line 17), ""th"" Inlightned spirit ""(line 25) and"" the urn""(line 31). These uses are non-deictic. The article is unmarked as regards spatio-temporal relations; so the function of deictic reference is to set up a continual spatial, temporal and subjective opposition between proximal and distal relations. Temporal distance is encoded by the past tense, reflecting content time, which is separate from coding time. In the latter part of the poem a more general ""present"" is implied, and this second content time is closer to the coding time. 9 Relevance, deixis and the poetic voice So far I have been working""backwards' from the specific deictic terms and elements of the poem to contextual possibilities and other pragmatic considerations. If we go one further stage in this direction we reach the metacontextual concept of relevance. Relevance can be seen as a concept governing interpretation (see Sperber and Wilson 1986). There is a context of relevance through which deixis is received, and we need to know to what extent analogy with other texts is pertinent. It should be possible to construct a pragmatic frame by which the deixis of lyric poetry in its various manifestations can be viewed. What kind of speaker is presupposed to be uttering ""Happy those early dayes!"" ? The ""poetic voice"" or ""persona"" is a recognisable post-Renaissance phenomenon. As readers we expect such a persona to describe a scene, dramatise some situation, and express feelings. There is frequently a ""personal"" element in poetry, but this element is couched within a highly formalised and conventional genre. This must affect and delimit the range of contextual possibilities and the frame of relevance. 9.1 ""Nutting""  As a final example I return to Wordsworth's poem ""Nutting"" . The poem is too long to quote in its entirety here, but the opening lines should provide a suitable contrast with ""The retreate"" : Here, a particular incident in the past is being recalled; so the bulk of the poem has a content time which is separate from the coding time. The present tense and modality of ""seems"" in the opening line combine to compound the present and the past, the content time and the coding time. As in ""The retreate"" , a distal demonstrative construction is used to point to time past; and this also has a qualifying element (the phrase ""which cannot die"" ). Wordsworth sets up a close relationship between the possessive pronouns ""our"" and ""my"" . We do not know whose cottage door is""ours', but the pronoun immediately suggests both a shared experience and a familiar discourse. The two participants in the situation are finally linked through the possessive NP ""my frugal Dame"" . This ease of discourse and assumption of shared experience is encoded for the reader, who does not have to work hard in processing the referent of the definite description""the distant woods'. Subsequent references to Wordsworth's surroundings are made with the definite article ( ""the woods',"" the pathless rocks'). The ""I"" figure assumes an intimate relationship with his implied audience. However, as the poet reaches the scene of virgin beauty, the definite article momentarily ceases its ""relaxed"" function and pushes the reader to more processing effort. This is realised in the referring expression""the hazels'. By excluding a verb construction from the exclamation ""A virgin scene!""  Wordsworth replicates syntactically the synchronicity of coding time and content time. The omission of the verb gives an immediacy which would be missing from a construction such as It is a virgin scene (where the present tense is a direct attempt to make a coding time and content time the same). 10 Conclusion I have stressed that I am taking a particular linguistic phenomenon, deixis, and examining its occurrences and behaviour in a specific genre. This leaves the possibility open of finding new insights into deixis per se as well as into its behaviour within a particular discourse. Because of this, I have not said that the analysis of deixis in the poetic text will necessarily be a useful stylistic procedure — giving greater insight into individual poems or poets. Most of the analysis of literary deixis has proceeded by using deixis as a kind of stylistic lever. I do not reject this out of hand; but it is not my primary purpose here; rather, it is to suggest a methodology which might enable us to gain insights into the functioning of the lyric poem per se, while always being mindful of the dangers of seeking generic overviews of historical phenomena. In ""The retreate"" , a complex linguistic and pragmatic site is displayed, and it is deixis which largely holds this together, enabling frames of context to be created, and leading the reader around and into the work. It is the same — and we should not be surprised at this — in ordinary discourse. We need to remember two fundamental points: language seems to be designed primarily for face-to-face interaction (that is, the canonical situation of utterance); and it is a capability of humans that they can mobilise discourse beyond this canonical situation and operate language free of contextual boundaries. It is the interrelationship of these points that enables the analysis of deixis in the genre of the lyric poem to proceed."

Well it is quite fine, I mean it do does make your eyes ache if you do it for too long. Yeah, I ca I can't do too much at once no well I mean but er Depends on the colours you're having to use really. Well yes we've got light colours so  The the worst possible is working with black fabric, that's that's wicked that is. Well yes it would be wouldn't it? It looks lovely though that one, doesn't it? What th the flowers on the black? Yeah. Yes it is nice  it's okay if you can do it in daylight, but artificial light is difficult  and I used to sit in the car when Charlotte was asleep. Mm.

Yeah, baggy ones aren't they? They are baggy, yes. Baggy dungeys. Yeah, they're lovely. Yeah she had those on. She's er she nice in denim actually. Mm. Suits her  It's the only thing I've bought from M & S recently. Mm. Cos, I haven't been impressed. No   Is it time? Mm mm. Oh  ooh half past three  What time did she go off, half past one? Oh, she'll she'll probably be asleep until five now. Oh. Once she goes, she goes. Oh  well cos she should really  she should go four hours shouldn't she, she's got good jollop  well she  Yes. seemed to have  Well yes, but I mean it's  she seems to do the opposite thing to Charlotte, cos she used to sleep in the morning and fidget around in the afternoons  and this one fidgets all morning and then sleeps in the afternoon. Yes, well Which is which is quite handy I suppose. And then is she awake in the evening? Yeah. Yeah  well that's not so bad as long as you can get her down at a reasonable hour and get to sleep. Yeah  well she  she sleeps she goes down some time between eight thirty and eleven. Mm. But sh I think what she does she confuses her early and late evening  feeds Mm. so they merge as as sort of one solid feed  Yeah. all da evening  but then like last night see if I know that she's been chomping on and off all night she'll go for four or five hours. Mm. Or five or six hours  Yeah. at night. Mm. So  and there you are. Mm  Makes you uncomfortable though, presumably does it or? Ah no, it's a it just lets down every now and again Mm. and it's sort of well it's not well they do get full that's if she suddenly does longer than Mm. she's been doing. Yeah. Then it's overflowing. Oh is that why you got that out again. That's right. You got your pump out again. Yes  yeah  well I've got two ounces in the freezer. Oh have you, oh well it's something I suppose. Yes, well if I can do a few two ounces worth I put them all together and then Adam can give her a little bit. Mm. So I can make the dinner or do something useful. Yeah. Cos I don't tend to get the opportunity. No. Cos she starts fidgeting  go and hang this lot up I suppose  Want to come upstairs? Yes, I'll come upstairs   That's a nice bread then isn't it? It is a bit big that's the only problem but the amount of bread we get through I need a big one. Yes, you couldn't put it all in the at once could you   Well  no no plus the fact that the lid got broken so that  Oh  that's a shame. Yes dropped by a certain clumsy person around this house  unfortunately we've had a lot of breakages. Oh dear. Yeah  never mind  So Adam said buy something that doesn't break. We've lost loads of glasses. Oh dear. And the lid of the bread bin. Yeah. So  and she ca I don't know whether you noticed or she can't make a cup of coffee without spilling it. Yeah, she she spilt it when she put yours down. Yeah. Yeah. She just can't  she's incapable of doing that without spilling it. She's a bit of a Jamie isn't she? She's a clumsy clogs that's why I won't let her walk around with the baby  if she wants to cuddle her I tell her to sit down and I tell her not to move  well she's always tripping over her feet. Mm. I'd rather not take the risk. No  that's right. Don't want her to go flying do I? No. Charlotte's been playing hangers. Yeah  there's one with things on   Look at these hangers you've got. Yeah well they're from all the All the clothes, yeah  well they're handy aren't they? Oh yeah  I washed all the well not all of them you know all the stuff we sorted out when you up here Mm. did a big wash the other day  so they're all ready  wo won't be long  and the clothes she's wearing now are nought to three months. Mm. And some of them are  are a bit short. A bit small yeah. Well I could undo the feet and put socks on her. No  you don't want to do that do you really? Or you can save some of these for Suzie. It would save me a few pennies. Mm  yes it would save you a few pennies wouldn't it, yes? Well we'll see how we go. I'm sure you've got quite a lot though. Yeah, we've got plenty really. She won't go unclothed that's for sure. No. Plus she's got all her new stuff. Well yes. Where are you? Here. Oh we're up here. You would would you have such a thing as a hand drill and some drill would you? Erm Oh no. Well all that sort of thing are in are in the erm  where the wine is. Oh by the in the toolbox thing? In the in the drawers. Oh in the drawers right oh yeah. There's all sorts of bits and pieces out there but  Right.

Do you know where the key is for the Yes, it's alright, it's by the door. Yeah, that's it. It's on the wall. Yes you were going to try and wash some of those  that were stained in something strong. Oh I haven't done that yet. You have no  it was that they were a bit big weren't they anyway  I'm sure  we could possibly get it out  you could try I suppose. Mm. I was in Woolworths the other day an they've got smocked dresses now, hand smocked dresses. Have they? Well it can't be anything else can it, you can't really machine smock can you? Well I shouldn't have thought so. So I don't know why they bother to put in it No  twelve ninety nine they were. It's like tinned food saying no artificial additives  cos you don't need artificial additives in tinned food they're trying to make you buy it cos Oh. it sounds healthy. Yeah. Right, that's that lot done, cor it's never ending isn't it? Yeah, it is isn't it  Thank goodness for washing machines eh? Absolutely. Don't know how I managed before I had Nigel. Obviously did didn't you? We didn't have a washing machine. Oh look little old hankies with a C on. Still around. Oh dear. Only one. Only one. I got a few flowery ones somewhere.

Oh   Yes, I leave one in there for her to keep er pulling on and off hangers. Oh I see  these lovely. Oh they're mine. Not really  Charlotte's need is greater than mine. the rubbish bin  there    it does look as though you had a bomb hit doesn't it? I know it's awful isn't it? That's all it takes. Yes, well  don't have er  so much time for tidying up No. when you spend an entire morning just child hanging off you. Oh, I know  not when she's doing that. What a horror  they drive you mad though, god  As soon as you've got you get used to stage with just Charlotte where you can get on and do things an  Yeah. she'll play beside you or she'll  come and help you or hinder you or whatever.

Wha tell you what might save you a journey  out there somewhere there's two automatic vent things  which I bought to fit but never did   but surely they would have bolts and fittings in them. Well I could maybe yes, that's why we need a few more to last than you possess  I'll go out and have a look and see about these. They're either in the greenhouse or in the shed. Oh right. I think. Yeah, I'll have a nose round and I'll, yes I could possibly put the window back and shut one of the vents, yes. Well it should have its so and nuts and bolts. I'll have a look. A wizard wheeze. Mm.

He's gone outside darling. I've I've got a, a piece of this, this stuff  I I bought it a piece  sort of square they were selling it off cheap  Charlotte. which is enough to do four little little pictures  I thought I might do for the craft thing in September, erm you know our flower festival and erm in which case I'd have had to purchase a few of your little thingies  that's pretty. Mm. Are you working from that book? Not at the moment. Could I borrow it? Yep, I'm not working from anywhere at the moment. These are nice   Oh no, no it's just a nice book this one.

Yeah, mm  well I was just picking a bit out of it Yes. it was for a card Mm. It wasn't for No  yeah well that's the sort of size piece I've got I think or maybe  it's a little bit bigger than that. Grandma  do you want er skim skimmed milk? Yes please  I don't want that. It's Charlotte's. She's giving you or apple juice is she? Pardon? She's only giving me Charlotte's drink. There's a nice duck. Oh yes, there's a nice duck  yes that's nice  mm. I think anything I do in the future is going to be purely from home consumption  or from places  Yes  I mean I'd like to do something like that, but you couldn't sell it  Mm, mm, mm, mm  yes. No. well you could but you couldn't sell it for a reasonable price. Erm, yeah now  pictures you want with I mean there's no panic but  Oh yes, yeah  when is it? er it's not till September. You've got to erm, I've got to get  well Dad's got the form I can get another one he can, erm  the forms have got to be in soon so she knows how many  are going to be sort of on the walls you know. Mm. Erm, but you can have three  three things  No. What are you doing with your pop pole? I want  Oh  nice isn't it? Erm yes three pictures that you might like to sell  if you give me a price for them. What sort of erm  price do they go for, things like that would you think? I've got no idea but I mean some pictures are very expensive Mm. the painted pictures. Ha. I mean what were you going to  hoping to sell them for anyway? Grandma. Mm? Twenty plus five, twenty  What's that? twenty five you know depending on the size  If there's a dog out there    Grandma. You'd like to think that you  I was I was tempted to sell it off cheap but I don't want to sell it off too cheap cos it's  Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma, Grandma  why's that? because of the price of the frame is quite expensive in itself. Yeah. But if that  I mean it doesn't worry me if I don't sell that cos it's quite pretty in poppy. Grandma, Grandma, Grandma. So it's the dog and that and the poppy. Oh  right. Really  oh excuse me. Er , so erm You started yet? No. Not at the moment, there you are let's move there. Well it was but that was a long time ago I started that, it was tucked inside the book  thank you. Thank you. Just a minute, cos er we must wait  for tea in the teapot. Oh, oh that's coffee is it? Oh  Oh Adam's given her strict instructions as to how to make tea. Oh I see, yes, you have to wait a few minutes. So she puts the pinger on for three minutes. erm  yes now  the  Beckley  Church, friends of Beckley church make  a quarter I think of whatever you sell it for. Cor! I think it's a quarter  Twenty five per cent? Or is it ten per cent? That's a big commission? Erm  I'm not sure now. I'm going to have to up the price considerably then. No , it wasn't I don't think it was  can't be  can't be twenty five per cent  Thank you darling. it's more likely to be ten  ten per cent. Ten or fifteen. Yeah, something like that. No more. Well whatever. Well I mean you could put them in for thirty, couldn't you? Grandma   Erm, you could try and if they don't go well  they don't go. They don't go. Do you want er sweeteners? No, not for me thank you sugar for Grandpa please. Yeah. Erm, there's no reason why you can't put them in at  that price I mean they're   Some mug might buy them! then little dog may be  erm won't go perhaps for that much. Well no there's no  no mount or anything on that one it's just  as is  that was a, the cheapest frame I could do cos I didn't like it  when I finished it and I begrudged the price of the frame. Oh  I think he's I think he's quite nice. Oh well you can buy him if you want. No I don't want him  but I still think he's quite nice I mean He's alright but he's there's no accounting for taste some people you know buy funny things. Yeah, I wouldn't buy it. No. I'll give it height but I wouldn't buy it. So they're the only ones you want to get rid of or are they the only ones you've got? Yeah, well I've still got the other two but  I don't know whether Brian and Pauline are going to want them back, I mean they've just, I've had them back for a craft fair. Oh that's the, the tile The tile and the alphabet. Yeah. But I I really couldn't  I would never get the price I would want for the alphabet. What would you want for that? Well I'd want over a hundred for that. Mm. Cos it's got an expensive frame and it's a lot of work. Mm. Ha. What's the matter? Don't you think you better wait till she comes back? Save me getting up. Now the I'm just trying to think of some some of those pictures that are in there  now there was one, it was that size  or in a pair like that lovely looking pictures  Look at me. they were done by  Peter , have you heard of Peter ? Look,rats ! he's we he's well known well known person  I'd I Dad'll tell you who he is  I'm   erm now those two little pictures were  oh I think they were hundred and something each maybe more. Well he's a well known artist. Well yes, I suppose he is. That helps. Yes, I suppose he is  but I mean those two those pictures we bought were hundred and twenty  and I mean they're they're only done by somebody in the village. Well yeah I mean the answer is But we like them. you pay what  feel don't you? Yes. If you like something enough  you know what you can afford and what you're willing to pay for it and if it's  priced more then you don't buy it. That's right. But you see something like that might just appeal to somebody, an embroidered picture. You never know  we will give it a try. Well. Is this in the flower festival? Yes. Well  it's in keeping then isn't it? Yes, in the the . Yeah so  I'll put you down for three then shall I? Mm. I don't know whether Dad's going to enter any photographs this year. Mm  that he doesn't want to sell. Grandma, you're here. he's old  what what was the percentage the church take on pictures, was it ten per cent or fifteen? Careful sweetheart. I think I have forget the sweeteners. Yes, I think so too. One. Erm  I I'm not sure I need to look at the sheet I  I thought it was ten when I looked. One. It can't be twenty can it? No, I think that's too much, I thought it was a quarter but it's not. Oh it's not twenty five per cent, no it's  it's it's around ten or fifteen per cent on the list. What are you you're thinking of  Thank you. the flower festival? Yes. Art exhibition? Yes. Well it's  Yeah, that that would be one of them  that little flower up there. Yes. And the pop poppies are in the hall aren't they? Mm. An and little dog  in the hall. , what's that? It's coffee, it's hot. She probably wouldn't notice much different.

A week in the life of. In the  . A jolly little incident in Kwiksave that you would have been amused at dear. Mhm. We wanted to get some Rice Crispies okay? And we thought  a good place to get Rice Crispies at Kwiksave cos they're cheaper than Tesco's. They were  we found the Rice Crispies  place didn't we? And there was just one sort of half opened, half scattered packet sitting there. So we looked around and there was erm  a box full of them right up high, yeah? So we thought oh well, go and get an assistant. Yeah. So it caused chaos Did it? you know trying to find an assistant cos there wasn't one walking about cos there was some at the  tills but there weren't any walking around and it was very busy, there were lots of people going through the tills. So anyway this girl eventually she said she was, it was her coffee break but she would come er in passing and sort us out. But mummy  mummy. So she came down, it was so embarrassing . Mummy. I explained about the Rice Crispies she said ah  Mummy. I think there must be some in here. There was another great big box but instead of being up high it was down below and I could easily  Mummy. have helped myself  to it . Mummy Yeah  seen it? Mummy. Well they must have been just well they must have I didn't see them  Mummy. They must have been unpacking Rice Crispies. Mummy They were a bit away from the Rice Crispie hole type of thing but  if I'd have used my eyes I would have noticed where they were. Mummy  mummy. Yes Timothy. You don't know what to say now you've you've shouted at me. Yes Tim, what were you gonna say. That's what I'm thinking. Come on. Let's hear it. Something about Rice Crispies? Something about going to the shops? Or something about going to the library? Who do you take to the library with you? No. Oh, didn't Christopher go to the library? Well he did but  we didn't sort of take Christopher. He just came. Oh. Somebody else came did they? Did you? Who did you take to the library with you? In your hand, who did you have? We took   You took teddy didn't you? Did you take a teddy? Did you? He chose   We hadn't actually heard anything about this library experience but when I asked him he wouldn't say anything. don't know what  We don't quite know what happened. to teddies.

A pretend picnic? Mm. He came out with a a a biscuit covered in desiccated coconut. Which he didn't like to eat so  Cider ate it in the end. Cider the dog . You can guess what happened  he gave it to me. Yes. Mummy dropped it when she was giving it to me. And then we had to pick it up and put it near Cider and Cider ate it. Cider likes coconut. However we still don't know what happened. Did you have some stories with this teddy? Yeah. Mm. Mum Stories about teddies? I don't like feeling hot. A teddy went in the dump. A teddy went in the dump? Oh dear. Did they get him out again? Mm. Because a  Oh. He kick them home. Kick them home. No He went in a van? Mum  What about story  was a bit like that. Mm.

They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday  during the week. Perhaps she's ill. What did you say? What did you say mother? I said there's normally a different lady in the  in the library. For what? On a Monday. The lady that was in there today  not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there  well, when she's there. The other lady, Josie, she's normally  in there. But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill. Or on holiday or something. No she can't be on holiday all that length of time. She's back now. No she wasn't today. There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday. But why didn't she go on a Saturday then? Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well.

DEM DEM-KE2-127 -0.11 "Good morning! Oh ! Alright? Thank you very much indeed! Thanks. Bye! Thank you. Bye bye then! Thank you! Hello. Have you any erm  stamps? First class or second class sir? Second class. Yes. Five please. Right. Certainly! I'll get those for you. Give that gentleman his paper. There you are. That's right. Lovely! Thank you very much! Thanks Mr . Five seconds my love. That'll do. Let's see what we've got, ooh I dunno if I've got, ooh yes I have! Yes I have! That'll be ninety pence won't it? Five tens are  That's right! fifty, five eights are forty, ninety pence. Good job I learnt my tables when I was at school! There's a lot that don't do it these days! Well my son does. They're very hard  at his school, we've always done them! It's very important! It's ever so important! But, from an early age because without  That's right. tables you can't do multiplication, It takes so , it takes so long to do everything you see. You can't do anything! That's right. You know, and I mean where he used to go to school they didn't teach them them till they were ten! What the hell of a use is that! No good at all! So I mean he is very, very good at his tables and  we bought one of those Early Learning  tapes when he was quite young that you sing  Yeah. to. Mm. And I always learnt mine parrot fashion using  That's right. sticks. That's right. And then we  got a table tester  to help them refresh their memories, it's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that's good as well but  I mean he's got them off by heart which is brilliant! Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything! Well absolutely! And I mean, fortunately he is very good at his maths and he's quick at his sums and things because he knows his tables. There's erm  That's right. so much difference! Well I've got, I pu put a program on, I've got a computer and I  Oh yes! put a program on the computer  for maths Oh right! and it's er  it's erm  it's a table program  amongst others, adding  Oh that's good! and subtraction and multiplication. Yeah. But, you know they can pick it and er, it just flashes up and they have to put the right answer in, if they get the right answer it it goes on to the next one, if it Oh that's good! get the wrong answer Yeah. then i it says no that's wrong! Sorry la whatever he name is that   What age group is that for then? Well this is really for anybody learning the tables. But, primarily it's it's it's, you know  top end of the primary school. Oh it sounds good! But you co could go on, I mean if you if they don't know it you can still use it when they get to secondary school. What computer is that then? Oh it's er, it's erm B B C  or  It's a Tandy actually , it's one I had  Yeah. given me  about eight  Right. years ago. So, and it's an old one actually Oh! but I've put, put my own program so that the  Ah! That's a good idea! But how old is your He's nearly ten. Yeah. Nearly ten. But he has,we we've only got, my husband's got a computer at work, we just got one of the Segas, the master systems you know that you you got th the games that you put in those  but he wants to get another one next year  but that's a good idea something like that! Should be very good for schools I would think, wouldn't it? Well, yes of course, I mean I, the schools have got programs I mean you can, you know  they er  Yeah. Yeah. Da ta for it. Yes. But that's, I think that's a brilliant idea actually! Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go  and erm  I think something like that is nice for them to actually   Where does he go? He goes to a school in the Tene Valley, it's a teacher that, he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher's opened her own school  and, only for lo a small time and then she's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she's a very good teacher! That's great, you see! And you see she's bringing him on very well! Yeah. I mean there's only a few kids there, they're all good mates and it's like private tuition. But, I  That's right. mean you pay for it, course you do but then  That's right. on the ar , we well you know we've paid for his education since he was seven because he wasn't doing anything at primary school! Half the teachers le left them doing nothing! It's a shame really! Yeah! Yeah! But er  you know, and it would have been such a waste cos he's bright. But that he was always naughty! They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that's because he's bored! He couldn't be bothered  you see. And how many more children slip through the net that way? That's right. It's very true. An and so we we said right, that's it! We'll have to get him out and  pay for it and it's  worked total dividends! I mean he's very good at  maths. They say maths and science are his strength subjects well I'd never have known that if he was still over there! I was just told he was a  a fair average. You know? Erm can I have sixteen of those  there? How many darling? Sixteen. They're two each, you know that do you? Oh! I'll have  Yeah they're two each my love. Er, then I'll You can have ten can't you?

FIC FIC-CCW-004 -0.24 "We beat southwards all that first day, slicing through a glittering sea, and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind. We hardly saw the Crowninshield twins. They briefly appeared on deck for lunch; a meal which Rickie hardly touched, while Robin-Anne, despite her apparent frailty, attacked the sandwiches and salad with the savagery of a starving bear. Afterwards, incongruously dressed in a raincoat, she went to the bows and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split and foamed at Wavebreaker 's cutwater. She did not stay there long, but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with Ellen. The contrast between the two American girls was almost painful; Ellen was so healthy and strong, while the waif-like Robin-Anne was pathetically wan and listless. ‘What do you think of her?’ I asked Ellen that afternoon. Ellen gave me an amused glance. ‘Little Orphan Annie? It's hard to believe she's about to be worth six million dollars. Still, she's got precious little else going for her.’ I smiled at the severity of Ellen's judgment. ‘Is she that bad?’ ‘She has a distressingly simple mind, with only room for a single idea at any one time. Presently that idea is cocaine, and nothing but cocaine. She has an obsession with the drug that verges on monomania. She tells me she needs to understand it if she's going to defeat it.’ ‘Don't you approve of that?’ ‘I think she'd do better to understand herself,’ Ellen said tartly. ‘She allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug, so she can only blame herself for her predicament. She'd find it more useful to understand her own character short-comings than to take an elementary course in drug chemistry.’ ‘What do you make of Rickie?’ I asked. ‘He's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out Phys Ed basketball-playing retard,’ Ellen said scornfully, ‘by which I mean that he's a jock with the brains of a dung beetle. He reminds me of your Neanderthal friend, the Maggot, except Rickie is a great deal more handsome.’ ‘Is he?’ She laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice. ‘Yes, Nicholas, he is. But he's not cute.’ At supper, as at lunch, Robin-Anne ate with the appetite of a horse, though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad. ‘Don't you like pasta?’ Ellen, who was perversely proud of her skills in the salad department, asked Rickie with just a touch of asperity. ‘It's great. Really awesome.’ Rickie lit a cigarette. ‘I just guess I'm not hungry.’ Robin-Anne reached over and tipped her brother's food on to her own plate. ‘Kind of starving,’ she justified her theft, then poured herself some diet soda. For once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on Wavebreaker , for Jackson Chatterton's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol, saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme. We were thus officially a dry boat, though I had hidden some Irish whiskey in the engine room, and I was sure that Ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka. It seemed that Ellen and I were not the only ones to take such a precaution, for late that night Jackson Chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand. ‘Bourbon,’ he explained laconically. ‘Want some?’ ‘I thought you'd never ask.’ He chuckled, produced two cardboard cups, and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey. We were alone on deck, though not the only ones awake for I could hear Rickie and Ellen's voices coming from the open skylight of the main saloon. I hoped Thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking the morning watch. ‘Cheers,’ I said. Chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement, then stared ahead to where a great beam swept around the sky. ‘A lighthouse?’ he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such things. I nodded. ‘It's called the Hole in the Wall. Once we're past it we can turn out to the open ocean. Things will be a bit livelier then.’ ‘Livelier?’ ‘We'll have a bit more sea, kick up some spray.’ I had spoken enthusiastically, but Jackson Chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect. ‘What are your plans?’ he asked me. I had nothing particular planned, merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean, though, mindful of the danger of tropical storms, I had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole. But I fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and, though we were short-handed, I reckoned that a few days out of sight of land would shake us all down quickly. I explained all that to Chatterton, but stressed that we would run for cover at the first sign of trouble. He must have assumed that I meant trouble from the twins, for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious. ‘They won't give you any grief in the next few days,’ he said. ‘Now that they can't get hold of cocaine they'll just crash out.’ I grimaced. ‘Does that mean they'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging?’ Chatterton poured himself more bourbon, then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf. ‘Coming off cocaine isn't like that. At first they'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep. It's the opposite of a cocaine high, you see.’ He paused. ‘The difficult bit starts two or three days later. That's when the real hell begins.’ ‘For all of us?’ ‘It won't be easy, ‘he said grimly, and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard. The big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins, and for that I was grateful. ‘I noticed that Rickie wasn't eating today,’ I said, ‘but Robin-Anne was?’ Chatterton nodded. ‘Rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago, which means he's probably already over the crash period. I promise you one thing; he's brought none of it on board. I searched him and his luggage, and he was clean.’ The big man thought for a few seconds, then laughed. ‘He'd better be clean! That turkey has got one chance of avoiding jail, just one, and that chance is by proving to the judge that he's cleaned up his act. And if he doesn't do that, then the man will send Rickie's plump young ass down to the gang-rape squad in the county jail.’ Chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect. ‘Can we be sure Robin-Anne didn't bring any of the drug aboard?’ I asked. ‘She won't have done that,’ Chatterton said with conviction. ‘That girl is serious about giving it up, real serious, heavy serious! That girl is really trying! She studies the drug, you know? Like it was her enemy.’ Chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration. I glanced up at the sails, down at the compass, then ahead to where the lighthouse loom arced powerfully through the night. ‘So what are the twins, chances?’ ‘Depends on their will power, 'cause nothing else will do it for them. There ain't no pill to get you off the powder, Mr Breakspear, only will power. And let me tell you, coming off coke is the hardest damn thing in the world, and you're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold your hand while you go through the hell of it. The twins’ daddy has paid for you and me, Mr Breakspear, and for everyone else on board this boat, but even with all that money and all this boat, we still might not succeed with them.’ ‘It's that hard?’ ‘It is that hard,’ he said ominously, and I thought of John Maggovertski's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder. ‘And it's even harder,’ Jackson Chatterton's voice was suddenly sinister, ‘for a poor person who has no one to help them.’ I stared at Jackson Chatterton, and at last sensed the drama  that lay behind his big calm presence. ‘Why did you leave the army, Mr Chatterton?’ I asked after a long pause. ‘I guess you can guess,’ he said. I guessed, but did not make him confirm my guess. Instead I asked whether the American army had helped him to kick his drug habit. ‘Sure they tried, they tried real hard, but back then I didn't want to be helped.’ ‘But you still got off cocaine? On your own?’ ‘Eventually.’ The light inside the binnacle glossed his black face with a sheen of red, sparking his eyes like fire. He was not looking at me, but staring doggedly ahead into the turning white light of the Hole in the Wall. ‘And I had to lose a good, good woman before I came to my senses. But I did kick the drug, Mr Breakspear, and it was probably the hardest damned thing I ever did in all my life. But once I'd done it, I swore I'd help others do it.’ ‘Even the very rich?’ I asked provocatively. ‘The rich trash pay the bills, Mr Breakspear, which lets me give my spare time away to the poor trash.’ I looked at the tough, impressive face. ‘Are the twins trash?’ He paused before replying, then gave the smallest shake of his head. ‘She's OK, but him?’ This time the pause was almost eloquent, then he gave a richly contagious laugh. ‘I'd have liked to have had Rickie Crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes.’ I laughed too. ‘Good to have you aboard.’ ‘It ain't bad being aboard,’ he said, and held out his hand and, not before time, we shook. By midnight I was alone on deck, and happy to be alone. I like sailing alone at night. I like to watch the phosphorescence curling away from the hull and I like to watch the brilliant specks of light fade in the black deep water far in the ship's wake. I like to be alone under the careless profusion of the stars, and alone on a moon-glossed sea. I like the sounds of a boat sailing at night. The sounds are  the same as those of daylight, yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block, the sigh of air over a shroud, the stretching of a sail, the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull, the curl of a quarter-wave falling away, and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness. I like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet. I like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness, when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn, which seems like a betrayal because, at night, in a boat under sail, it is easy to feel very close to God — for eternity is all around. I tacked the ship shortly after midnight, doing the job by myself and enjoying the work. Ellen was still awake, talking in the stateroom with Rickie, but everyone else seemed asleep. I wished that Ellen and Rickie would go to their beds, for the soft mutter of their voices was an intrusion on the dark and star-studded infinity through which I steered Wavebreaker . I had just winched in the staysail's port sheet when the explosion sounded, or something so like an explosion that I instinctively cowered by Wavebreaker 's rail as my mind whipped back to the crash of practice shells ripping through the sleet in Norway. The sound of the explosion melded into a terrible noise that was like an animal dying in awful, bellowing pain, but beneath that sound of agony was a harsh metallic scrape and clash that punched at my belly and eardrums. If anything the sound seemed to become louder as I ran down the deck. The noise was a foul but apt accompaniment to the schooner's fitful motion for, with her wheel lashed and her sails only half trimmed,Wavebreaker was bridling and jerking into the short hard seas that were driving through the North-East Providence Channel. The noise rose to a scream; like the sound that a beast would make while being disembowelled. I stepped over the coaming and down into the cockpit where I cannoned off the binnacle before snatching open the companionway hatch. I put both hands on the rails and vaulted down to the  accommodation deck. I slipped as I landed and fell against the bulkhead. I scrambled up and reached for the eject button on the cassette deck. I punched the button and was rewarded with a blessed, ear-ringing silence as the offending cassette slid out. ‘Shit! What is this?’ Rickie, apparently still vibrating to the music, sprang up from the stateroom couch. ‘Hey! That was my tape, man! I was listening to that!’ Ellen was grinning from the other couch, but I was in no mood to humour her amusement. ‘Thessy's sleeping for the morning watch, for Christ's sake!’ I accused her, wondering why she had let Rickie play such an appalling din at such volume at such a late hour. ‘We're just listening to music!’ Rickie was suddenly truculent, twisting off the sofa and dancing towards m ‘on the balls of his feet. An inch of ash spilt from his cigarette as he raised his hands in a threat to hit me. ‘Rickie!’ Ellen called warningly. Some grain of self-preserving sense must have penetrated Rickie's skull, for he suddenly dropped on to his heels and offered me a placatory grin. ‘You should like that sound, Nick!’ he said happily. ‘It's really heavy English music.’ I looked at the cassette which claimed to be music recorded by the Pinkoe Dirt-Box Band. ‘New shipboard rule,’ I said, ‘no English music on this boat, unless played very softly or through earphones.’ I tossed the cassette to Rickie who, turning away and thus leaving his blind eye facing me, fumbled the catch. He stooped to pick up the tape. ‘Are you saying I can't play my music?’ He was suddenly spoiling for a fight again. ‘The man is saying that you keep the noise down, and I am saying that you do what the man says.’ Jackson Chatterton had appeared in canary yellow pyjamas at the far end of the stateroom. His looming presence utterly cowed Rickie who whined something about only wanting to play Ellen a little night music, and that he had not meant any harm, and what was a guy supposed to be doing on this boat anyway? It wasn't the goddamn navy, really, and he went on muttering all  the way past Chatterton's impassive gaze and so into the cabin that the two of them shared. Thessy's scared face appeared at the other cabin door, but I shook my head at him, mimicked sleep, and he ducked back inside. ‘Sorry, Nick,’ Ellen said, though not with any great contrition. ‘Forget it.’ I was still angry, but there was no point in pursuing what was over, so I went back topsides to trim the ship, and five minutes later I saw the stateroom lights go out, and half an hour after that the lights in Ellen and Robin-Anne's cabin were doused, leaving only a light in the forward starboard cabin to show that either Rickie or Jackson Chatterton was still awake. I wondered if they had simply forgotten to turn off the bulb which annoyingly cast its brightness through a porthole and on to the swirl and rush of white water, and I was half tempted to pull the fuse out of the circuit and thus surround Wavebreaker with darkness, but resisted the impulse. The night became quiet again. Wavebreaker settled on her new course and, by the time the small hours were growing, we had left the island's lights well behind and I was cutting her prow hard into real ocean waves. We were on the starboard tack, fighting into the trades as we clawed our way out from the Bahamian shoals into the deep waters of the Atlantic. The difference in Wavebreaker 's motion was extraordinary. She had disdained the smaller waves in the shelter of the islands, but now she seemed to tremble as her hull soaked up the ponderous force of the ocean. This was proper sailing. And, as if to celebrate her freedom, she dipped her cutwater into a sudden trough of the sea and then sprayed white water high over her bows. The shudder of the bigger wave sent a shock wave through the long hull, and I laughed aloud with the pleasure of it. Then, as I often did when I was alone at sea, I began to recite Shakespeare. I knew reams of the stuff, yards and yards of it, learned from my father; the one absolutely true gift of my childhood. I liked to hear the verse, and enjoyed declaiming it, but only if there was no one to hear me, for I knew that my voice held all the fine cadences of Sir Tom himself. That night I belted out one of my favourite speeches, the one from the second part of Henry IV in which the new king, Henry V, rejects the friendship of Falstaff. I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers; How ill white hairs become a fool and jester! I have long dream'd of such a kind of man, So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane; But, being awaked, I do despise my dream. I stopped abruptly. A movement had startled me and I turned to see Robin-Anne Crowninshield, dressed only in a white nightdress, standing in the main companionway. ‘That was really great,’ she said. She was shivering violently. ‘You'll find an oilskin jacket in the locker at the foot of the stairs,’ I said, ‘and you'll also discover that Ellen has left a Thermos of coffee on the stove, and I like mine without sugar but with milk. You may have to unscrew the stove-fiddles to release the Thermos, and you'll find the milk in the fridge to the right of the stove.’ She nodded grave acknowledgement of all my instructions, then disappeared below for five minutes, eventually returning swathed in one of the vast, padded and multi-layered foul-weather coats, and carrying a mug of coffee. ‘I assume it's caffeinated?’ she asked in her thin voice. ‘It is indeed proper coffee,’ I confirmed, ‘but if you insist on the wimpish unleaded kind then you will find a jar in the locker above the sink. Are you hungry?’ ‘I'm OK.’ She sat at the edge of the cockpit, curled her legs into the warm shelter of the jacket, then hunched down into the thick collar so that all I could see of her face was her enormous, moon-silvered and lemur-like eyes beneath the pale gleam of her short bright hair. She yawned. ‘How long till dawn?’ ‘An hour. Couldn't you sleep?’ ‘I set an alarm. I wanted to be up. Mom said I shouldn't miss the dawn at sea, she said it's kind of beautiful.’ She rested her head against a cushion so that she could stare straight up through the network of rigging and past the light-blanched sails to where the stars wheeled their cold fire beyond the mastheads. ‘Where are we?’ ‘We've just left the North-East Providence Channel and we're in the open sea now. Did your brother's music wake you earlier?’ She shook her head, then seemed to shrink even lower inside the enveloping jacket. ‘You look happy,’ she said, almost accusingly. ‘That's me. Just a dim, shallow and happy Brit.’ I had meant her to laugh, but instead she frowned as though my happiness was a puzzle that needed to be understood. ‘Are you going to recite any more of that poetry?’ ‘No.’ ‘It was Shakespeare, right?’ ‘Right.’ ‘It was good,’ she said. ‘He was a great poet,’ I said, as if she needed to be told. ‘I mean your voice and delivery,’ Robin-Anne said fervently. ‘It was good.’ ‘It was imitation,’ I said in self-disparagement, ‘just imitation.’ I suddenly heard my father's voice telling me that all acting is mere imitation. ‘That's all it is, dear Nick! Only imitation, mere mummery. Why do people take it so seriously?’ The wheel suddenly pushed into my left palm and I could feel all the thudding pressure of the sea and the wind concentrated into that one polished spoke. I eased the wheel up, drawing Wavebreaker 's bows harder into the sea and wind, and I was rewarded with another shattering of white spray that exploded prettily about our bows before I let the hull fall away once more. I laughed for the sheer pleasure of playing such games with God's strong world, then remembered the senator had told me that Robin-Anne liked to sail. I asked her if she wanted to take the wheel. She seemed to shudder at the very thought. ‘I'd be frightened.’ ‘But you can sail a boat, can't you?’ ‘I used to sail a little cat-boat in Penobscot Bay, but that was a long time ago. Grandmother lived there in a house that looked over the water, but she's dead now.’ She spoke sadly, as though to a twenty-four-year-old there really was a time of lost innocence, and I suppose, if the twenty-four-year-old was a cocaine addict, then there was indeed such a time. ‘I've never understood the appeal of a cat-boat,’ I said, ‘all that great big undivided sail and weather helm and barn-door rudder. It must be like going to sea in a haystack.’ Robin-Anne nodded very earnestly as though she truly cared about my opinion, but her next question showed that she was paying no attention to my inanities. ‘What do you think of us?’ she asked instead. I glanced at her, trying to hide my embarrassment with a swift and flippant response, but I could think of nothing to say and so I looked back at the binnacle, then up to the long moon-burnished sea ahead. ‘I feel really awkward, you see,’ Robin-Anne explained her question, ‘and ashamed.’ ‘I'm just the skipper of this barge,’ I said, ‘so you don't have to explain anything to me.’ ‘I feel like a circus animal’— Robin-Anne ignored my disclaimer —‘because you're all expecting me to perform my antics, and I'm not sure I can do it.’ ‘What antics?’ ‘To stop using cocaine, of course.’ She frowned at me. ‘You're all watching me, waiting to applaud.’ ‘Is that bad?’ ‘It's patronising, and it's my own fault that you can all patronise me, and I hate myself for it.’ ‘Come on!’ I said chidingly. ‘We all like you!’ ‘That's what I mean.’ She fell silent for a moment and I saw she was watching the long heaving waves slip past our flanks. Then, with a rustle of the stiff jacket, she looked back to me. ‘Did you ever try cocaine?’ ‘No.’ ‘You've not even been tempted by it?’ ‘No.’ For a moment she was silent, staring at the sheen of night on the crinkled sea, then she smiled. ‘You're lucky. You're a cocaine virgin. Stay that way, because it's the most addictive substance on the planet.’ Her last words had been spoken very portentously, and I rewarded them with a dubious shrug. ‘Heroin? Alcohol? Nicotine?’ ‘You have to persuade a laboratory animal to become addicted to any of those drugs, but you only need to give an animal one dose of cocaine and it's hooked.’ The luff of the flying jib had begun to back and fill and so I let the ship's head fall away. ‘But the real danger of cocaine,’ Robin-Anne continued softly, ‘is that it provides ecstasy, Mr Breakspear.’ ‘Call me Nick.’ ‘What cocaine does, you see, is to make the brain produce a thing called dopamine. That and a whole lot of other chemicals, but dopamine is the main one.’ Her voice was very earnest, as though it was desperately important that I understood what she said. ‘I know it's weird,’ she went on, ‘but pleasure is merely the result of naturally occurring chemicals secreted in the brain, and cocaine can turn those chemicals on like a faucet. Can you imagine a day of pure pleasure, Mr Breakspear?’ I did not need to imagine such a day, I could remember plenty. I remembered lying in bed with a pretty girl while the rain fell on a Devon river outside our window. I remembered the honesty of Masquerade in a force five wind, and then I thought of all the good days to come; days of Ellen and me and Masquerade in far seas, and I must have smiled, for Robin-Anne nodded approval of whatever silent answer I was framing to her question. ‘Think of all that happiness,’ she said, ‘and understand that a single hit of cocaine, just a single hit, will produce a hundred times as much pleasure-making  dopamine as that one happy day. A hundred times! It's like making love to God. It's euphoria.’ I looked at her, but said nothing, and she must have mistaken my silence for disbelief for she hurried to explain her evident knowledge about the drug. ‘I studied cocaine, you see. I had to. I wanted Rickie to stop using it, and I wanted a friend to stop using it as well, and so I learned everything I could.’ ‘And did learning about it mean trying it?’ She nodded. ‘Yes.’ ‘And thus you discovered euphoria?’ She nodded again. ‘And it's the euphoria that's so addictive, because you've been to heaven, and the real world seems a very dull place afterwards. So you begin to take more cocaine, and quite soon you need more and more cocaine to unlock the gates of heaven, and once you reach heaven you don't want to leave it and so you take still more cocaine, but by then it isn't working.’ She stopped abruptly, perhaps fearing that she was boring me. I turned the wheel a fraction, waiting for her. ‘The catch in this heaven,’ she went on, ‘is that the brain has only got so much dopamine to offer, and once the cocaine has used it all up, then that's the end of the pleasure. Except the brain is screaming for more dopamine, so you overdose because you can't accept that the drug isn't working any longer, and it's then that cocaine starts doing its other things to you. It shrinks the arteries, and that's what blinded Rickie's left eye.’ I really had nothing useful to say, so I responded with a sympathetic noise that only made Robin-Anne shake her head impatiently. ‘There's worse,’ she said, ‘far worse.’ ‘You mean a heart attack?’ ‘No…’ She drew the word out, so that I heard in its simple syllable all the pain and hurt of the drug. Robin-Anne had been staring at the dark sea, but now she turned her big eyes back to me. ‘The worst thing about cocaine is that once it has exhausted all the dopamine from the brain, then what's  left is a black hole of depression so big and so awful that not all the misery in the world can fill it. People try to beat that misery with barbiturates, but nothing can cure it because you've taken away from yourself all chance of feeling pleasure. The doctors have a word for that misery; they call it anhedonia, which only means an inability to feel enjoyment, and that's what it is, but it feels like hell, like true hell, and it's a hell you can't even escape from in sleep because overdosing on cocaine gives you chronic insomnia.’ Hell was being without God, I thought, but I said nothing, just stared instead at the white wash of cabin light on the rushing water, and I wondered why some people could take cocaine and just walk away from it, while others ended up in hell, or in a peep-show which was probably the same thing. ‘Of course,’ Robin-Anne went on, ‘the brain eventually manufactures more dopamine, so after a day or two the cocaine can work again, and you go soaring up from hell into heaven. It's a roller-coaster, Mr Breakspear, up and down, up and down’— her thin white hand suited the action to her words —‘from heaven to hell and back again, and if heaven is euphoria then let me assure you that hell is a terrible place.’ ‘So remember the hell,’ I said, as though I really could help her with my tuppence worth of cheerful encouragement, ‘and perhaps that will stop you ever going back to it!’ ‘But there's another kind of hell,’ Robin-Anne's voice was dulled, as though my cheap optimism had depressed her, ‘which is remembering the euphoria, and having to surrender the means of creating it. That hell is giving up cocaine. I'm in the easy stage, the first few days when you just sleep and eat, but quite soon I'll be in the hell of denial, Mr Breakspear.’ I looked past Robin-Anne to where the moon's path gleamed on the long waves, and then I glanced forward and saw another belt of silver, but this one diffuse and hazy, showing where the first crepuscular light seeped over the world's grey edge. ‘Dawn,’ I said in a hopeful voice. But Robin-Anne did not react, and I looked down to see that she was not watching for the new day, but was crying. I  did not know what to say or do. I should have knelt beside her and put my arms around her and promised her that she would be freed from the hell of anhedonia, and that there really was a God and that she did have the strength to tear herself free from cocaine, as others had freed themselves, and I should have assured her that there was true happiness without a drug, but I did not know her well enough to embrace her, so I just let her weep as the sun streaked up in glory from the east. Thus Wavebreaker sailed towards the light, carrying her passengers to hell. I rousted Thessy out of his bed with a cup of tea, then went to my own bed as he took over the wheel. I slept, dreaming of Masquerade sinking through waves of steel into torrents of fire. I woke just before lunchtime to find Wavebreaker still sailing eastwards. Ellen was showing Rickie Crowninshield all the elaborate electronic toys that only Ellen wholly understood; the radios, radars, weatherfaxes and satellite receivers, and Rickie was being surprisingly attentive, but as soon as he saw me he scowled and clamped a pair of headphones over his ears as though to make sure that he did not have to hold any kind of conversation with me. Ellen shrugged at his rudeness. ‘How's the weather?’ I asked her. ‘No change.’ I squinted through a porthole and saw the sky was scraped blue and bright above an empty sea. ‘You faxed a chart?’ I asked Ellen. ‘Sure did.’ She handed me the sheet of grey paper with its synoptic chart which had been transmitted from Florida just a few moments before. I pretended to despise such modern aids, but that was really a defensive reaction because I knew I could never afford such frills for Masquerade . I saw that there was not even a ripple of low pressure off to the east, which was the reassurance I wanted, for a depression to the east could swiftly twist itself into a full-blooded storm. ‘Good morning, Rickie,’ I said loudly, wanting to demonstrate that I held no grudge for his behaviour in the night. ‘Yo.’ His voice was surly, but suddenly he twisted round to face me and took off the headphones, and I thought he was going to apologise for his rudeness of the previous night, but instead he demanded to know if it was true that we were out in the open ocean and were not planning to make a landfall for some days. ‘That's true,’ I said. ‘But I wanted to do some scuba!’ he said in outrage. ‘There'll be a chance, I promise.’ ‘Jesus!’ he said in exasperation, then turned abruptly away. I waited to see if he would say any more, but he evidently did not want my company. I grimaced at Ellen, then went topsides where I found the ship being steered by its automatic pilot and Thessy and Jackson Chatterton perched halfway up the mainmast with reels of rigging wire from which Thessy was fashioning a parallel set of starboard shrouds. I wanted to double up all Wavebreaker 's standing rigging, just in case we did try to take her across the ocean. There was no sign of Robin-Anne who was presumably asleep. Chatterton climbed down to the deck and told me that Robin-Anne had eaten a huge breakfast. ‘What about Rickie?’ ‘He just played with his food,’ Chatterton frowned, ‘and that means he must be over the crash period, which means his behaviour's going to be difficult.’ ‘Even more difficult?’ I asked with dread. The big man laughed. ‘Nick, you ain't seen nothing yet.’ It seemed that Jackson Chatterton was right, for we were all witnesses to a dreadful metamorphosis in Rickie. When he had joined the ship he had been nothing but eagerness and smiles, romping about like a new puppy, but now he had turned unrelentingly morose. At lunchtime he scowled at his sister who, wrapped in a dressing gown, fell on the sandwiches as though she had not eaten in weeks. ‘I'm famished!’ Rickie would not even try a sandwich, but instead pushed his plate away and lit a cigarette. He sipped at his can of diet soda and grimaced at the taste. ‘Have we got any beer on this boat?’ he suddenly asked. ‘No,’ Ellen said placidly. ‘Doctor's orders.’ ‘Fuck the doctors.’ No one responded, which merely annoyed Rickie. He stared at his sister whose pale face was made even paler by the sun-block ointment she had liberally smeared on her skin. ‘You like this shit-for-drink, Robbie?’ Robin-Anne nodded, but was too busy eating to take much notice of her brother, though she did manage to mumble that she thought the diet soda was really kind of good. ‘I think it's really kind of crap.’ Rickie turned his truculent gaze on me. ‘You must have some liquor aboard, Nick?’ ‘Not a drop,’ I lied. ‘That's very un-British of you.’ He attempted an atrocious imitation of my English accent. ‘I thought all British ships were fuelled by rum, sodomy and the lash. Isn't that what they say?’ ‘That's what they say.’ I kept my voice friendly, for I was determined not to be drawn by his provocation. ‘Are you gay, Nick?’ Rickie suddenly asked me in what purported to be a tone of serious enquiry. I did not answer, while everyone but Robin-Anne, who was too busy eating, seemed embarrassed. Once again the lack of response infuriated Rickie who, seeking some other means of provocation, hurled his can of soda across the deck. ‘Shit-juice!’ he shouted. Ellen caught my eye, and we stared at each other for a sympathetic fraction of a second, then I looked away to see that the sticky liquid had sprayed across the teak planks. ‘Clean it up,’ I said mildly. ‘Rum, sodomy and the lash!’ Rickie chanted at me with a sudden and extraordinary vindictiveness. Jackson Chatterton stirred as though he proposed to clean up the mess himself, but I waved him down and kept my eyes on Rickie. ‘Clean it up,’ I said again. ‘You clean it up. This is our vacation! I didn't suggest coming on this heap of a boat to work like a house-servant, isn't that right, Robbie?’ Robin-Anne just went on eating. ‘Clean it up,’ I told Rickie again. Rickie seized Thessy's can, pulled open its top, and hurled it messily after the first. ‘Now what are you going to do? Flog me?’ He suddenly laughed, then looked at Ellen whom he perceived as a possible ally. ‘You can never tell with a Brit, can you? It's either a flog or a fuck.’ Ellen said nothing to encourage him. Robin-Anne ate stolidly on, while poor Thessy looked terrified. Only Jackson Chatterton seemed comfortable with Rickie's display of petulant temper. ‘The man said clean it up,’ Chatterton said calmly, ‘so clean it up!’ But Rickie was long beyond sense. ‘This is a vacation!’ he screamed at me, ‘so why are we out here? I want to see a beach! A beach, you know what a beach is? Sand? Surf? I want to go board-sailing, maybe do a little water skiing. I want to do some scuba, for Christ's sake!’ I ignored him, fetching instead a mop and bucket from one of the big stern lockers. The bucket had a rope attached to its handle and I skimmed it over the stern to haul up a gallon or so of sea-water which I slammed down in front of Rickie. ‘The deck needs cleaning, Rickie, so do it.’ I threw the mop at him. He ignored the mop, just staring at me, and I saw him take a breath ready to defy me so I spoke before he could. ‘Either you clean the deck, Rickie, or I'll scrub it with your hair.’ He began to weep. Robin-Anne glanced at him, then smeared mustard on a roast beef sandwich. ‘It's real good food,’ she said enthusiastically. ‘I'll help you,’ Ellen said to Rickie, then she took his hand and placed it on the mop handle. ‘Come on,’ she said gently. Thus, as Rickie feebly dabbed at the deck and as his sister ate, our happy ship sailed on."
FIC FIC-CDB-004 -0.12 "The wonderful thing about the human mind, Adam thought, is the way it copes when the worst happens. Beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing, the unimaginable has taken place, and on the other side is death, destruction, the end. But the worst happens and you reel from it, you stagger, the shock is enormous, and then you begin to recover. You rally, you stand up and face it. You get used to it . An hour maybe and you are making contingency plans. For what had happened was not the worst, you realized that. The worst was yet to come, was perhaps always yet to come, never would actually come, because if it did you would know it, that would be reality, and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself. Quickly. Now that he was able to, he assembled what had happened and laid the facts before himself. They had dug up those bones at Wyvis Hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating. Bones, skeletons, bodies, do not bury themselves. Those were the facts, as far as he knew them up to this moment. He would know more, much more, in the days to come. What was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key. It was defunct. The passages it cancelled had, in any case, as in certain programmes, not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved. Adam sat in his parents' house, drinking tea. There must be a total retrieval now, the one good thing about which was that it might banish his dreams. He was aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold, an absence of hunger, though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane. Anne sat next to him on his mother's cretonne-covered settee and Abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor, kicking with her legs and punching with her arms. His mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her. A passage from a novel by John O'Hara came back to Adam. He had memorized it years  ago in the Ecalpemos epoch: ‘The safest way to live is first, inherit money, second, be born without taste for liquor, third, have a legitimate job that keeps you busy, fourth, marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities, fifth, join some big church, sixth, don't live too long.’ Apart from the last one which he hadn't got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in America more than here (here he had joined the golf club) he had complied with all the rest. Or his nature and luck had complied for him. Nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold. He had not wanted to come back here. But there had been no spirit in him, the shock of what his father told him had been too great. ‘Something that will interest you, Adam, something to make you sit up. They've dug up a lot of human bones at my old uncle's house…‘ By the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north. Anne was furious. When Lewis said to come back with him and eat there Adam had got a kick on the ankle from Anne and another kick when he hadn't replied. He had turned on her and said with cold savagery, ‘For fuck's sake, stop kicking me, will you?’ He expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one's wife or not in front of the child, he was capable of that. But he had said nothing, only looked subdued, and Adam realized why. His own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was: keeping silent. Having put the cat among the pigeons, made mischief in his special way, he was lying low now and waiting. The old bastard. Adam only wished Uncle Hilbert had left him Wyvis Hall and then there would have been no Ecalpemos, no Zosie, and no deaths. And Adam couldn't see he would have been much worse off. He and Anne would be living in a house like this one, rather than that neo-Georgian palace. Children, after all, he thought, looking at Abigail, were happy wherever they were, so long as they were loved… His parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been. The conversation was exclusively on the subject of the discovery at Wyvis Hall. Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away. If he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand, his holiday would have been spoilt. He would have liked very much to be alone. Of course he knew there was no possibility of this, now or when he returned home, for when you were married you never could be alone. Presumably that was the point. What was he going to tell Anne? How much was he going to tell her? He didn't know. None of it, if he could help it. They sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea. Lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited Wyvis Hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news. ‘He had a beard then, Anne.’ Lewis's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour. ‘You wouldn't have recognized him, he looked like John the Baptist.’ Adam could remember very well but he wasn't going to say so. ‘What a funny thing,’ said Lewis. ‘We had ham salad that day too. What a coincidence! Oh, yes, I've been meaning to ask you, who was it looked after Wyvis Hall while you were in Greece?’ Adam could eat nothing. The other time, he remembered, it was his father who hadn't been able to eat. He didn't know what Lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he, Adam, had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet, to keep him away even. ‘Someone from the village, you said,’ Lewis persisted. ‘How can I remember that far back?’ ‘The police will want to know. It may be of vital importance.’ ‘Aren't you going to eat your meat, dear?’ said Beryl. Abigail, who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep, set up a wailing sound. Adam was on his feet at once. ‘I think we should go.’ They had to wait until his father was ready. Adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but Lewis wouldn't hear of it. Anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while Adam was in the back with Abigail. If his father could have found out what flight they were coming on, the police certainly could. It was possible they might be waiting for him. They would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of Wyvis Hall. He looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him. It would be owners and occupants of Wyvis Hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview, and those were Great-Uncle Hilbert, who was dead, himself and Ivan Langan to whom he had sold the house. As for other occupants, how would they know who else had lived there? It was ironical that ten days before he had seen Shiva at Heathrow. The encounter he now saw as an omen, a shadow cast by a coming event. What would that event be? Adam did not want at this point to speculate, it made hi– feel sick. He turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs. In high spirits, his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years. As soon as they got home, Anne started getting Abigail to bed. Their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom, Adam looked Rufus Fletcher up in the phone book. He was in there twice, at a Wimpole Street number and again at an address in Mill Hill: Rufus H. Fletcher, MB, MRCP. All these years then, or for some of them, Rufus had been living three or four miles from him. He couldn't look Shiva up because he couldn't remember his surname. Women marry and change their names, he thought, there was no point in pursuing that one. Of course he could look up Robin Tatian but where, really, would that get him? He was reaching-for the blue directory when Anne came back with Abigail in her arms, so Adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her. She was almost asleep. He wondered if Rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way  Adam worried? Was his whole life affected by what had happened at Ecalpemos? Adam might have escaped the file memories for years, suppressed them and jerked violently away from them, but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events. Sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects. He sat by Abigail's cot, not wanting to remember, but knowing that now he must. There was nothing in his house to remind him of Ecalpemos. Everything that was left, everything he and Rufus hadn't sold, had gone to Ivan Langan with the house. For a song, too, because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back, meeting a valuer, walking about the house, picking things off shelves and out of cupboards. Only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough, like a dream — no, like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film, a Hitchcock movie perhaps. He asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house. It was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done, nothing had been touched. From the pine wood he simply averted his eyes — till later. The drift was thickly overgrown, a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes. One of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger. That thorn had been there, festering, for months. A dull cool summer it had been, as different as could be from the year before. No golden light bathed the red brick of the house. It no longer looked mellow. Beautiful, yes, but severe somehow and, to Adam's heightened awareness, reproachful. He found himself encouraging, fostering, the scenario illusion. Only thus, only by pretending unreality, pretending this was a part he acted, could he go on, cross the wild, shaggy grass, go past the black-branched cedar tree, arrive at the porch set in its four Doric columns and insert his key in the lock. In the film there would have been something terrible  awaiting him. A dead thing hanging in a noose over the stairs. There was nothing of course, only a & int smell compounded of dust and dry mould. Ecalpemos. He no longer called it that. It was Wyvis Hall once more, his house, but bringing him no pleasure, no deep, excited, almost sick joy. He breathed deeply, walked through the rooms, went upstairs, being the actor in the film. In a few moments the other participant in the sequence they were shooting would come, the estate agent from Sudbury. While they had been there the previous year there had been hardly any visitors. It was as if the magic house in the wood had had an invisible fence set around it or — what did they call it?— a shutting spell. The clear air, Constable's unique Suffolk light, had in fact been impenetrable, a barrier that held off intruders as a sheet of glass might have. This was all fantasy, of course, for one or two people had come, Evans or Owens from Hadleigh, the coypu man, a meter reader, the man who wanted to do the garden and whom he had turned away with a lie. But for the most part they had been undisturbed in their magic island or resort that was closed to others but which they could leave when they pleased. Coming and going — there had been too much of that. Things would have been very different if they had stayed put. The doorbell rang. It made him jump — inevitably. But it was just a bell that rang, it did not buzz or chime. He let in the estate agent and took him over the house, into the drawing room and the dining room, upstairs to the Pincushion Room, the Centaur Room, the Room of Astonishment, the Deathbed Room, the Room Without a Name, and then back down the back stairs to that jumble of kitchens and scullery and washhouse and coal-store, most of it a nineteenth century addition. What a lot of this sort of thing the Victorians had needed! It was all quite tidy and clean, as Vivien had left it. But he could not say Vivien's name then, he could not even think it, only look about him fearfully, clenching his hands. He opened the door to the gun-room and showed the estate agent the interior. There was a table in there and a  Windsor chair. The floor was of black and red quarry tiles and there were racks on the walls for the guns but these, of course, had gone, Hilbert's two shot-guns had gone, one buried in the Little Wood, the other in his bedroom at home in Edgware, zipped up in an old golf-bag under the bed. The estate agent suggested an asking price and took some measurements and then a photograph, standing on the edge of the lawn that had become a meadow, where Rufus had stood and taken photographs a year before. It was windy and the cedar, which he had likened to a galleon and Zosie to a witch, danced witch-like, its branches arms and leaping legs and flying skirts. The car went off up the drift as many times Goblander had gone. Adam had given his only key to the estate agent. He closed the front door behind him and started to walk. He had forgotten all about arranging for a taxi to pick him up or looking up bus times or anything like that. Presumably, the estate agent would have given him a lift somewhere. It was too late now. Cold water drops fell on his head from the leafy roof of the tunnel. In the deciduous wood a pheasant uttered its rattling call. He emptied his mind, he walked like an automaton up on to the green ride, seeing at the end of it the cameo of stacked meadows, segments of wood, a church tower. He was holding his breath. His head he was keeping averted, looking in the direction of the drift, at the wall of cluster pines with their black needles and their green cones. He knew the distance from the ride, thirty paces. When he turned his head he kept his eyes closed, let out his breath, opened his eyes, looked and heard himself give a little whimpering sigh. It was the sound a man might make when in physical pain but trying not to show it, suppressing complaint. There was nothing to see, nothing to show. The place was as it had always been, a downland in miniature, a terrain of small green hills on which little dolmens had been raised, pink granite, white marble, a slab or two of grey stone. Wooden crosses. ‘By what eternal streams, Pinto… ’ Each in their narrow  cells for ever laid were Alexander, Sal, Monty, Ranger, Blaze. And to the right of Blaze the green turf lay undisturbed, very slightly irregular, as the whole area was, a reticulation of tiny-leaved plants, minuscule flowers, netted into the grass, a small pit here filled with pine needles, a shallow rut there with a sandy bottom. Rabbits had mown the lawn here more effectively than any piece of machinery. Their droppings lay about like scattered handfuls of raisins. Adam found he was holding both hands clamped over his mouth. He turned and ran, along the ride, up the drift, not looking back. Anne, waiting downstairs for him with coffee and sandwiches on a tray, wanted to talk about the find at Wyvis Hall. He found himself unexpectedly touched by her simple assumption, the way she absolutely took it for granted, that he was innocent. Adam didn't want anything to eat. He was thinking of Hilbert's shot-gun that he still had but which he should perhaps not keep much longer. ‘You've never told me any of this,’ Anne began. ‘When you got the solicitor's letter saying you'd inherited the place it must have come as a terrific shock. I mean, didn't you have a clue?’ ‘I thought my father would come in for it. Everyone did.’ ‘Why do you think he left it to you like that?’ ‘Not because he liked me. He hardly took any notice of me. He didn't like children and when I got older I stopped going. I hadn't been near the place for four years. My parents went.’ ‘Then I just don't understand.’ ‘Look, he was an unpleasant old man.’ Adam looked hard at her. ‘My father is an unpleasant old man and I daresay I shall be. Verne-Smiths are.’ She didn't say anything. ‘I think it happened this way. He saw through the toadying, of course he did. My father was just a blatant sycophant. He thought to himself, right, you've called the boy Hilbert to please me, to make me like him, so I damn well will like him, I'll like him more than you and leave him the place over your head.’ ‘Do people really behave like that?’ ‘Some do.’ Adam thought. ‘Frankly, if it were me, I would. I might.’ ‘Do you want some more coffee? No? I suppose you whizzed straight down there and had a look at your property?’ ‘No, I didn't as a matter of fact. I hadn't time, I had to go back to university. Anyway, I was going to sell it, I wasn't all starry-eyed about my lovely house, you know.’ That was just what he had been. Once, that is, he had seen it again after a four-year absence. But he had not guessed he would be and had postponed his visit till term ended in June. All that term his father had been planning ways and means, trying to overturn the will, looking for compromises, plotting for all Adam knew a frontal assault. What he did not know he had got from his sister, his ally against their parents if in nothing else. ‘You'd been there for your holidays as a little boy? Did you love it then?’ ‘I don't think so.l can't remember. I think I'd have preferred the seaside. Kids do.’ ‘And did they show you the animal cemetery when you were a child?’ Anne persisted. ‘I suppose so.l can't remember. Do we have to talk about it?’ In fact, he couldn't remember ever having heard of it until the day Shiva came in and told them what he had found. Vivien thought it was children buried there. Adam shivered as he remembered that. Well, with her bent towards Indian mysticism she wouldn't be able to understand the way they went on about animals. Adam had a sudden awful vision of the spade going through that green turf and coming up with a skull on it. Something like that, it must have been like that. Was the shot still there, among the bones? Later he lay in bed beside Anne, trying to think of a satisfactory yet thoroughly non-committal story to tell the police. Like most middle-class English people who have never had anything to do with them, Adam thought the police were fools. Anne had fallen asleep almost immediately. She had a habit, when she slept on her back, of making soft sounds in her throat. This was not snoring but a kind of clicking, irregular and sporadic — that was what made it irritating — and liable to start when least expected. Adam had only heard one other make these sounds and when he first heard Anne make them his memory escape failed and those two nights were startlingly evoked, so disturbingly in fact that he had the terrible delusion that Anne was doing it to mock him. Of course that was nonsense. She had never heard of Catherine Ryemark and never would if he had his way. Several minutes might pass without a click and then one would come and another would come and another one fifteen seconds after that. It drove Adam mad. Once, in a fit of temper, he had told her she only started doing it after they were married. If he had heard her do that in their single days he would never have married her. But now, the soft clicks coming with typical irregularity, he listened to them painfully and let his mind slide back ten years to what he must remember, to the truth he must recall if he were going to be able to tell lies. He lay still with his eyes open, staring into the darkness that was only half-darkness because this was London and not Suffolk, where on moonless nights the small hours were black as velvet. Click, pause, click, a long silence. At last it had been cold enough to need a blanket and a quilt, to hold Zosie in his arms without the sweat pouring off them both. For a long time that night too he had not slept, had lain thinking, wondering what to do, listening to the delicate sounds like tiny bubbles breaking — and then hearing them no more. Adam closed his eyes and turned his head away from Anne. A down-stuffed duvet in a printed-cotton cover lay over them. It had been a quilt at Ecalpemos, faded yellow satin, brought in by Vivien from the terrace when the rain began. Quilts were what you lay on to sunbathe that summer, not for warmth on beds, but slung for lounging comfort as it might be on some Damascus rooftop. Night after night they had lain out there in the soft, scented warmth, looking at the stars, or lighting candles stuck in Rufus's wine bottles, eating and drinking, talking, hoping and happy. That summer — there had never been another like it, before or since. It was the hottest, driest summer any of them had ever known. The previous one, 1975, had been very good, especially the latter part, but that one, the summer of Hilbert's death and of Ecalpemos, had been glorious from April till September. If it had been grey and raining and chilly he might have taken one look at Wyvis Hall and turned tail and fled to Crete or Delos or somewhere. Certainly he would have gone down there alone to spy out the land and check on his property. Rufus wouldn't have wanted to go and he would have had to go down on his own by train. There were so many ifs and conditions, so many other eventualities that easily might have happened. In the first place he had only approached Rufus because Rufus had a car. If his father hadn't been so bloody-minded and had let him use the family car, he would no doubt have gone down alone and come back next day, having called on some estate agent in Hadleigh or Sudbury and asked them to sell the house for him, the very one probably that he had gone to in the following year. But things had not gone that way. It had been a glorious sunny day and he had wakened up in the morning rather early for him in those days. About nine. His other was on holiday, though he and his mother were not going away anywhere, in spite of what the doctor had advised, but staying at home and ‘going out for days’. Or that was what they said. They hadn't been out for any days since Adam had been at home. 18 June it was, a Friday. The date was stamped indelibly on his memory calendar, more than just stamped, etched in. He thought he would get up and go to Suffolk and take a look at his house. His generation — perhaps all generations at that age — hated making plans, making arrangements ahead. Adam had viewed with near-incredulity his mother's preparations in the past for going on holiday, the way everything in the house seemed to get washed, the way she and his father wore their worst clothes for days beforehand because the best ones were  packed, the phone calls she made, the notes she left for tradesmen. He liked to do things spontaneously, be up and off on the spur of the moment. His other wouldn't let him have the car. It might be needed if they went out for the day. Adam said all right, not to worry, he would manage without, but this didn't seem to please Lewis either. He would have liked, Adam knew, to have lived in a time when a father could forbid his son to do things and the son would obey. Or rather, to have the rules of that former period prevailing now. Adam didn't say where he planned to go, though he thought his father guessed, but got on his bicycle and cycled over to Rufus's. He couldn't remember what he had done with his bike when he got to the Fletchers', left it there and collected it next day perhaps, but he could remember most of the rest of it. What he had worn, for instance. Jeans cut off thigh-high to make shorts and a T-shirt he had made out of an old man's vest he had bought for 20p in a sale under the arches at Charing Cross Station and dyed green and yellow. His hair was tied back with a piece of tinsel string he had found in the Christmas decorations box. Those were the days before people dyed their hair bright colours, the days of henna. Adam had put henna on his hair and that and the sun had turned it reddish-gold. His beard, though, was black and rather curly. He must have looked a sight but he didn't think so then. His legs were bare and he was wearing Indian leather sandals, the kind you had to soak in water before you first put them on. It showed what the weather was and how they had started taking daily sunshine for granted that he hadn't got any sort of jacket or sweater with him even though he expected to be away overnight. The Fletchers had a swimming pool. It was supposed to be a teardrop shape or shaped like a comma. This summer was the first anyone had made much use of the pool. Rufus was sitting on the blue-tiled rim of it with his feet dangling in the water. He was three years older than Adam and though they had been at the same school, Highgate, they had not been friends then. It was Rufus's younger brother Julius who had been in the same  form as Adam, a rather dull, pompous boy, a sort of phoney intellectual, and they had never had much to do with one another. Adam and Rufus had met as members of the same squash club. That was what they seemed to have in common, that and Rufus's brother and Adam knowing each other already, but after a while Adam got to see things he admired in Rufus, his toughness, the way he'd got himself organized and in hand, the way he knew where he was going and yet still could be amusing and casual. Of course he had got to know him a good deal better at Ecalpemos… Rufus was very laid-back and Adam liked that. He also liked Rufus's occasional sensitivity, which didn't seem to go with the other aspects of his personality. And Rufus was wild too, the way medical students had a reputation for being. Adam thought of himself and Rufus as being wild and laid-back at the same time, equally like that, young adventurers with all the world before them and all the time they wanted to do what they liked with. Rufus said, Hi, and come for a swim, so Adam took off his shorts and went into the water in his black nylon underpants. They would has/e swum naked only Rufus's father had discovered them doing this and made a fuss out of all proportion to the offence, if offence it was. ‘I reckoned I might go and take a look at my inheritance,’ Adam said, checking that the key to Wyvis Hall was safe in the pocket of his shorts. ‘Now, d'you mean?’ ‘Yes. I guess so. Why not?’ ‘Want me to drive you?’ Rufus had an old Morris Minor van that he had bought third- or fourth hand, but it went all right. It got you from A to B in one piece, as Adam's father remarked sneeringly of it. That had been well before the motorway, the M25, was built. You went to Suffolk by the A12 through Chelmsford or took the country route. This was what Lewis had always called the route that went by narrower, winding roads through Ongar  and Dunmow, Braintree and Halstead to Sudbury, and that was the way he had driven them when they all went out to visit old Hilbert. Adam did for Rufus what Lewis would have called ‘navigating’. It maddened Adam, his misuse of this word, which couldn't of course be applied to guiding anyone on land, coming as it did from the Latin navigare and thence from navis , feminine, a ship, and agere , to drive or guide. Adam loved words, was fascinated by them, their meanings and what you could do with them, with anagrams and palindromes and rhetorical terms and etymology. One of the subjects in the mixed B A course he was doing at university was linguistics… ‘Directing’ Rufus was what he was doing, he told himself. They had talked about words during that drive, well, place-names really, with particular reference to the villages that were called Roding after the river: High Roding, Berners Roding, Margaret Roding, and Rufus told him they were pronounced Roothing from the old Danish, which Adam hadn't known before. It was a beautiful drive and the countryside looked wonderful, a kind of sparkling shimmering green in the heat and sunshine. The sky was huge, a pale, bright, cloudless blue, and the white surface of the road ahead rippled in the heat mirages that made it look like little waves. The farmers were haymaking, cutting the tall feathery grass and its dense admixture of wild flowers. The windows of the van were wide open and they had the radio on, not playing rock, which they both hated, but Mozart, one of the better known of the piano concertos. In spite of all the times he had been there Adam missed the turn-off that was the drift leading down to Wyvis Hall. It was somewhere along the lane between Nunes and Hadleigh but so much vegetation had grown up that spring that everything looked different. They drove about a mile further, right up to the group of buildings called the Mill in the Pytle, and Rufus, turning the van round, asked what a pytle was. Adam said he would look it up. He told Rufus to drive a bit more slowly and this time he spotted the six-foot-wide gap in the hedge with, on the right-hand side, almost hidden by cow parsley growing up and elderflowers hanging down, the wooden box on legs with  its hinged lid into which Hilbert's-mail and newspapers and milk had been delivered. As a little boy, Adam had sometimes been sent up here in the morning to fetch the letters and the paper, carrying with him a wicker bottle-basket for the milk. There was no other sign that this was Wyvis Hall. ‘Why's it called a drift?’ said Rufus, lighting another cigarette. He had chain-smoked all the way down and Adam had had one or two to keep him company, though he didn't really like putting something lighted in his mouth. That was the trouble for him with dope. He liked the effects of it but didn't like having to smoke it. ‘I don't know,’ he said. ‘I don't know why it's called a drift.’ ‘You can look it up when you look up ‘pytle’,’ said Rufus. On either side the drift was thick with cow parsley, its powdery white heads coming to an end of their long blooming. It had a sweetish scent, like icing sugar, like childhood birthday cakes, that mingled with the winey perfume of the elders. All the trees were in full leaf but the oaks and beeches had not long so been, so that their foliage was still a fresh, bright colour and the lime trees were hung with pale, yellow-green, dangling flowers. The pine wood looked just the same as ever, it always did, it was always dark and dense with very narrow passages through it that would surely allow nothing bigger than a fox to weave its way through. Imperceptibly the trees must have grown, yet they seemed to Adam no different from when he was a child coming up to fetch the milk and when, on sunless mornings, he had felt a kind of menace from the wood. Even then he had not liked to look into it too much but had kept his eyes on the ground or straight ahead of him because the wood was the kind of place you saw in story-book illustrations or even in your dreams and out of which things were liable to come creeping. At the foot of the slope, through the thinning trees, a field maple, alders with their feet in the stream, a late-blooming chestnut, that dramatic lawn-adornment, the cedar, the house  came into view. Things, buildings, stretches of land, are said to look smaller when we grow up. And this seems only natural, just what one would expect. After all, the top of the table that was once on a line with our chin now reaches only to our thighs. Wyvis Hall, logically, should have looked smaller to Adam but it did not, it looked much larger. This must have been because it-was his now, he owned it. It was his and it seemed a palace. On the stable block, in which nothing had ever been stabled in Adam's memory, was a little tower with a running fox weathervane on it and below the small pitched roof a blue clock with hands of gold. The hands had stopped at five to four. Between the block and the house you could just see the walls of the walled garden, flint-built, crossed and coped with brick-work. A mass of flowers covered the house, a pink climbing rose and a creamy clematis. Adam had not known these names, but later on Mary Gage had told him. Because the sun shone so brightly the slate roof blazed like a slab of silver. Rufus pulled up in front of the porch. The whole area out here was paved and small stonecrops and sedums with white and yellow starry flowers grew up between the stones. In a couple of narrow-mouthed stone vessels grew a conifer and a bay tree. The rose which mantled the house must have put out a thousand flowers and these were at the peak of their blooming, not a petal yet shed, each blossom the pink of a shell within and the pink of coral on its outer side. Adam got out of the van and felt in the pocket of his shorts for the key. He was aware of a profoundly warm, placid, peaceful silence as if the house were a happy animal asleep in the sun. ‘And this is all yours?’ said Rufus. ‘All mine.’ Adam was equally cool. ‘I should be so lucky in my avuncular arrangements.’ Adam unlocked the front door and they went inside. The windows had been closed for nearly three months and the place had a dusty smell that got into your throat and made your eyes smart. It was also very hot, for the drawing room faced due south and the hot sun beat on the glass. Adam went about  opening windows. The furniture was all his too, those cabinets with bulging fronts and curved legs, chairs with buttoned backs, a velvet-covered love seat, a big oval table supported on a wooden base shaped like a vase, mirrors framed in gilt, pale mauve and green watercolours and dark portraits in oils. He could not remember noticing any of this before. It had been there but he had not seen it. Nor noticed the pillars of rosy marble that supported the window embrasure, nor the alcoves, glass-fronted, that were filled with china. Only the overall impression was familiar, not the individual pieces. He felt a little sick, engorged with possessions and the pride of ownership. In each room a chandelier hung from the ceiling, of tarnished brass in the dining room, a cascade of prisms in the drawing room, in hall and study Italianate glass tubes twisted snake-like amid false candles. And everywhere the sun streamed or lay in golden pools or rainbow spots or squares made by windows patterned with the shadows of leaves. Rufus was among the bookcases in Hilbert's study. Adam took down Edward Moor's Suffolk Words and Phrases , couldn't find ‘drift’ but here was ‘pytle’or ‘pightle’,a small meadow . He went back into the drawing room where he unbolted, unlocked and threw open the french windows. The sun came to him in a warm gust or like a warm veil enveloping him. It whitened the terrace beyond with a clear, unbroken glare. All along the terrace, on the low wall that bounded it, stood the statuary his father had once told him had been placed there by whoever inhabited the place before Hilbert and Lilian came. They represented, in some kind of fine-grained grey stone, the loves of Zeus. He remembered them all right. As a child he had studied them with fascination, enquiring what the bull was doing to the lady, and receiving from his parents no very satisfying answer. Hilbert he had been too much in awe of to ask. They had come from Italy. Some cousin of Lilian's two or three times removed had found them in Florence while there on her honeymoon and had had them shipped home. There was Zeus as Amphitryon with Alcmene; Zeus coming to Danae in a shower of gold (difficult in stone, this one); snatching Europa; swan-shaped, wooing Leda; standing before the hapless Semele in all his destructive glory, and in half a dozen other metamorphoses. Someone had been looking after the garden, you could see that. Flower beds had been weeded, dead heads removed, the borders of the willow-fringed lake shorn and trimmed, the lawns recently mown. As they walked along one of the stone-flagged paths and came to the gate in the flint wall they saw a neat pile of mowings waiting, apparently, to be composted. The walled garden too had been carefully maintained. Inside the netted fruit cage Adam saw the bright, ripe, vermilion gleam of strawberries nestling among their triform leaves, raspberries yet green on the canes. All along the facing wall espaliered trees, their trunks dark and shiny and twisted and knobbed, bore among a rough, dull foliage fruit turning gold. Nectarines, Adam remembered, and peaches too. Weren't there greengages somewhere that scarcely ever fruited but when they did were splendid? Red and white currants here in rows, berries like glass beads, gooseberries with a ripeness the colour of rust on their green cheeks. They each took a handful of strawberries. They walked to the lake where there were two pairs of ducks, mallards with feathers as if painted in iridescent green, and from which a heron rose on gaunt wings, its legs dangling. Adam looked back at the house, at the honeysuckle that curtained the back of it in yellow and pink, at the martins, sharp-pinioned, that wheeled in and out from the eaves. He was in a state of tremulous excitement. He seemed only to be able to breathe shallowly. It was curiously sexual this feeling, exactly the way he had once or twice felt with a girl he was mad to make love to and who he thought would let him but was not quite sure, not absolutely sure. The slightest thing would turn his fortune, snatch it, send him home frustrated, bitter, in a sick rage. He felt like that now. If only he could breathe properly! And here was the finest country air, transparent sparkling sun, the distant low hills and soft basking meadows half-hidden by the blue haze of noon. ‘You're actually going to sell this place?’ Rufus lit a cigarette, offered him one. Adam shook his head. ‘What else can I do?’ What choice did he have? He couldn't live there, he couldn't keep it up. Adam lay in bed beside Anne, his mind repeating what he had said to Rufus on that wonderful day in June. ‘What else can I do?’ Of course he should have said I don't have a choice. Come on, I'm hungry, let's go get some lunch and then we'll find an estate agent. But they had bought food on their way coming through Halstead, the 1976 version of takeaway, a couple of meat pies, apples, Coke, and they had had lunch lying in the grass by the lake. The magical quality of the place crept on them there like a spell, the warmth and the sunshine and the scents of the garden and the tranquil silence. But it was more than that. There was an indefinable ingredient, a kind of excitement. It had something to do with history and the past, that excitement, and something to do with potential as well, with what Orwell or somebody had said, that every man really knew in his heart the finest place to be was the countryside on a summer's day. I was happy, Adam thought, that's what it was. The Garden of Eden. Shiva had called it that, but in his mouth it had not been the hackneyed expression it would have been if an English person had so referred to it. He was drawing an interesting image from the mythology of another culture and it had seemed to him fresh and new. Adam had merely shrugged. The Garden of Eden was the way certain people would describe any charming landscape. Yet the phrase had remained with him, particularly in its darker aspect, the way it appears to most of those who are bound by the puritan ethic, not as a haven to live in and enjoy but as a paradise to be expelled from. It was almost as if a necessary condition of being in this paradise was the commission of some frightful sin or crime that must result in expulsion from it. On the day they had gone, when the summer was over and the skies grey and a wind blowing, he had thought of that image. Their departure had  something in it of the bowed and wretched mien of Adam and Eve in the many ‘expulsion’ paintings he had later seen, and by then the Garden itself had a ruined look, paradise destroyed. He got out of bed to have a pee. He and Anne had a bathroom opening out of their bedroom but Adam, when he got up in the night, usually went to the other one that was on the far side of the landing. This was because his reason for getting up at all was to see if Abigail was all right. But he had used their bathroom and was back in bed again before he realized that he had forgotten to look at his daughter. His anxiety for her had been displaced by a greater worry — was that possible? Ever since her birth he had been ultra-anxious without expressing, even to himself alone, his reasons for this. Of course he knew what those reasons were but he had never faced them. Now he did and they did not seem absurd, they seemed like good reasons. He got up again and padded across to Abigail's room. Suppose, after all, that he had not gone to look and in the morning they had found her stiff and cold in her cot, her eyes glazed and unfocused, her lips blue? He shivered, gooseflesh standing on his face and arms. Abigail lay on her side, well tucked in, the teddy bear she was too young for sitting in the corner by her feet. Adam stood watching her, listening to her silent sleep."
FIC FIC-FAJ-011 -0.25 "TWENTY-TWO The canvas of my tent (to be exact, not canvas but a green plastic material) is flapping in the breeze which comes over the plains and stirs the dry leaves where they lie on the bottom of the dry river. Outside, the embers of my fire glow as the breeze fans them. A lion roars in the dense thicket into which the watercourse runs. Over at the laibon's engang they are bedded down behind their own thicket of thorn bushes, the cattle jammed together in a large boma and the goats in a smaller one right in the middle, as far from the athletic leopards as possible. My travel alarm glows in the dark. It is four thirty in the morning. I am out here alone, unprotected, only a thin piece of plastic-canvas away from lions, buffalo, leopards and hyena. But I am more disturbed by the sharp, diving whine of a mosquito, which produces an anticipatory tension by its frequency alone, just like the moment when the dentist turned on his drill and swung the whole clumsy contraption over my youthful, gaping mouth. I wonder if the children in the engang are frightened. Our own children are now so far removed from danger, at least of the primal kind, and these Masai are so close to it, that you would expect them to be cowed and fearful. Outside the engang is a night world into which the Masai never venture. It is a combat zone which they concede to the predators until morning, when they drive out their cattle again past sleeping lions and strangely reticent hyena. The children are left out on the plains with a few goats from a very young age. Yet as they step forward for a greeting, receiving the palms of your hands on their springy hair, they show no sign of fear or anxiety. With their monsters and wolves and unpredictable dangers, fairy stories are supposed to prepare children for life in some symbolic fashion. Here the dangers are real. In the few weeks that have gone by a  boy from the village has been killed by an elephant. If my understanding is correct, the boy was looking for a missing goat on the edge of the thicket when he was charged by a cow elephant and killed. There is no mourning for children; by the next day the body was eaten by the hyenas. There is a compensation scheme and the laibon wishes me to drive one of his sons fifty miles to a small town to collect the papers. My arrival and my anticipated help with the paperwork have been fortuitous. I don't like to ask how much money they will receive from the government, but the laibon tells me: seventy-five dollars, the price of two new cows. I realize that the forty-nine cows that were offered to the district officer's relatives was a huge sum, however you measure it. And the district officer's family got nothing. Dawn is approaching. The roof of the tent begins to glow, like the mantle of a gas lamp turned up very slowly. It is cool outside as I throw a log on the gently breathing embers. I put the kettle, already nicely blackened and battered, into the pile of ash and climb back into my camp bed. Wakefulness at this time of day is notoriously unsettling: in London it brings balls of anxiety to the gut as the sodden city outside sneers at the sleepless. Here I feel awake and ready, compelled to be on my feet when the sun reaches us, and the cattle, fretful and peckish, are released in a torrent of bay and brown and white, their huge horns gradually unlocking and separating as they spread out into the plain. The warriors always accompany them when they must travel long distances to find green grass. Green grass, green grass. Pre-dawn. Claudia lying in her hut listening for the first sounds of life. A satisfying pile of notes and tapes accumulating. The tapes, the same ones I have back at Mr Shah's cumin-scented hotel, neatly stacked on a shelf made from a tea-chest draped with Somali cloth. Over at the engang they  are starting their fires into life. Is Claudia longing for her Masai lover? When and where does he visit her? The emptiness of the landscape is illusory; there is no privacy here. A warrior will plant his spear outside one of the small huts to indicate that he is inside and should not be disturbed, but I can't imagine Claudia, chic Parisienne, et cetera, allowing her relationship to be semaphored in this way from outside her own hut. As I lie here under the green, seaweedy tent I remember from some trite television interview, a remark made by Brigitte Bardot, loopy Parisienne, namely that in all her many love affairs she was off at the first sign of the waning of passion. Perhaps Claudia grew tired of Tepilit. Perhaps the cultural divide was emphasized by being lovers and she quickly found she had nothing to say to him. Victoria and I have undoubtedly passed that milepost. Victoria thinks that I am not sufficiently in love with her to want children. Even the most liberated women believe that there is an evident connection between sex and children, a notion whose truth is only tested after the event. After her unfaithfulness, I found the connection severed. If the purpose of sex is to have children, then, is there a special sort of casual, slightly illicit sex with near-strangers which has nothing to do with procreation and is also more exciting than the other steady sort? (The wronged one feels entitled to the interrogatory role.) ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Was it more exciting?’ ‘Don't.’ ‘You know what I mean. The whole business. Getting clothes off, zippers, panties, his cock, what he wants to do to you and you to him.’ ‘You make it sound sort of mechanical.’ ‘Oh, so it was not sort of mechanical, but quite tender with a lot of cosy conversation? How nice.’ ‘Oh, Jesus.’ ‘What I mean is, why can't you just admit that it was wonderfully exciting to fuck somebody else?’ ‘How stupid do you think I am? If I say it was wonderfully exciting, you will wonder when I am going to do it again, and if I say it was a mistake, which it was, you are going to ask me under what circumstances it might not have been a mistake.’ ‘Actually, I could ask you a lot more interesting questions than that.’ ‘I know, like how big his cock was and so on. But these are not questions that come into it.’ ‘Did he come in your mouth?’ ‘Please. I have apologized, I have grovelled. I can't do any more. I just hope it will pass. That's the accepted wisdom.’ ‘Time is the great healer.’ The trouble is I don't want to be healed.’ ‘You don't want to be healed because it means you don't have to justify running away.’ I'm the injured party, yet she is suffering more than I am. The sun is now striking the tent and the trees around, producing an underwater effect on my green tent like kelp swaying in a tide. I clamber out of bed. I have to make a great effort to keep the tent tidy. It's amazing how quickly my few possessions become disarranged. Claudia lived here for nearly four years, creating a small, domestic homestead. Often she would go to Nairobi or the coast for a break and to get supplies. The fire burns evenly with a thin hot flame, as though there are no oils or resins in the wood. I am drinking my coffee from a tin mug, bacon frying in the pan and scenting the air, and toasting a large slice of bread on a fork, as the bee-eaters begin their busy day and the vervet monkeys start  to squabble. Although I know that in these matters there is almost no limit to what people will do, I am horrified that Victoria should have subjected herself to an Aids test and — as I have heard happens — the offers of emotional counselling and financial advice. My heart, however, does not respond in the desired way to her letter and certificate. I see it as a silly gesture springing from her work in advertising, the promotion of appearance over substance. What she won't want to hear is that I am cured of the madness which kept me from sleeping at night and the imagination which played havoc with my peace of mind during the day. This seems to be the way it is with men and women; buckets of water from a well, one drawing deep while the other is empty, and so on, as if there is a physical law governing the amount of emotional nourishment available to a couple. Bardot with her crazy affection for animals, Claudia and her unspeakable death, Victoria and her Aids test: I see them all linked in some fashion. I see women as closer to the tragic than men because of the frailty of their expectations which have no solid foundation in the world. I see their hopes like Masai villages, impermanent and leaving few marks on the landscape. Of course, I could never tell any woman these thoughts. Perhaps, like Letterman, I think of myself as having some useful feminine understanding. The bacon is strongly scented, very porcine; in the pan it is not going brown but looking more like a slice of pig than bacon should. I prod it with a fork and brown it on the fire before introducing it to the thick slice of toast. Another cup of coffee is ready as I bite into my breakfast. It's surprisingly good even though the presentiments of pig are confirmed by the taste. I throw the rind, as thick as a pencil, in the direction of the vervet monkeys, but they show no understanding of my offer. Nobody has ever donated anything to them before. From across the open stretch of ground hemmed in by the watercourse and the thicket, from at least half a mile  away, I can clearly hear the engang preparing for the damburst of cattle. I hurry over in that direction. I am impelled there. The grass is so dry it seems impossible that it can ever come to life again: yet the huge acacia trees along the riverbed are putting out blossom, delicate sprigs of green in anticipation of the rains to come. Mana. The old anthropological concept dreamed up in the universities to describe the potentialities of nature as understood by primitive people. As I stride across the plain I feel I have a glimmering of what it means. It means a nervous dependence upon nature, a relationship with a step-parent who can never be entirely relied upon. Non-stop vigilance and propitiation are advisable. The importance of trying to keep in nature's good books is plain as the cattle call and stamp impatiently. Today the laibon is expecting me to take his son in the Toyota. His son is standing near the main entrance, ready for the journey, carrying a stick, a spear and a small leather bottle, similar to the sort of thing drunken youths use to squirt wine down their throats before braving the bulls in Pamplona. (I have done this myself although no bull came anywhere near me.) The cattle are thin and some are listless but so far there have been no deaths. The young men split the cattle into two groups and head off to find pasture. Two girls are loading the donkeys with water containers and sacks. They greet me, but they are amused by my appearance. I see them discussing me; one of them doubles up. They compose themselves as the laibon appears and suggests we sit down for tea. With a few whacks and some loud whistles, they drive the donkeys out of the enclosure. The laibon's face is always troubled, as though the thoughts which are his special preserve are weighing on him heavily. He drinks the tea brought to us by the koko gravely, and makes exasperated noises. The laibon's son, paramat, and I walk back to my camp. He is tall with an elongated, finely made face, a Masai face, lending some weight to the myth that the Masai came from the Nile. When he smiles, he looks slightly goofy, the skin pulled right over his cheeks like the face children make by sticking their fingers in the corners of their mouths."
FIC FIC-FAJ-014 -0.17 "TWENTY-FIVE The koko served us tea as we sat in the middle of the boma after the cattle had gone. (We were probably sitting on about three feet of dried dung, crumbly and friable.) She poured the tea into large enamel mugs. I had seen the donkeys plodding reluctantly up the escarpment to fetch water miles away. Donkeys are not natural enthusiasts; they walk as if they have arthritis. I felt guilty that this hard-won water should be wasted on a tea ritual when I had gallons of mineral water at my camp. But she ministered to us as the tape-recorder whirred. The tea was loaded with sugar, and milk from a gourd was added in a thin stream like milk being drawn from a cow's udder. As she was pouring the tea it occurred to me that maybe she knew Claudia too. She was the first of the laibon's four wives many years ago. Now she is a benign presence which gives the engang a heart. I am now reading Uitsmijter's transcript of what the laibon had on his mind. The owl of Minerva flies as dusk is falling: the laibon believes he is not long for this earth. He has had some revelations which he wants to pass on to me. They are that the rains are going to cease falling and, because of the restrictions placed on their movement, the Masai will not be able to follow their tradition of moving on. As I read, it seems to me that this is not his literal meaning. He is voicing the complaint of all old people about the closing down of their universe. Death is the removal of all the possibilities which sustain us in our lives. But also, I guess, he is exercising his right as a laibon to prophesy. Headmasters, senators, judges, priests all see themselves as having a particular duty in this regard. A politician invited to make the wedding speech can be relied upon to dish up some  predictions along with the eternal verities. The laibon retells the accounts of his illustrious ancestors of the great migration from the North. He wants me, for some reason, to realize that he knows the lights are going out in the Masai world. He sees that finally the Masai myths have been overtaken. He tells me of a great battle his ancestors fought near Lake Victoria. He speaks of a battle against the Germans. He prophesies a war of the Masai against the townies. (I wonder if he realized that there are serried ranks of townies behind the front line that he has encountered.) The pebbles he has thrown have shown these things. The uprising against the townies will take place after the next eunoto, which is the gathering of thousands of warriors at the end of their time as morans. Thousands of warriors collect from the huge Masai district to have their heads shaved by their mothers before undergoing rituals to launch them on their new — somewhat dull — life as elders. There is no music, only the hoarse, erratic bellow of a kudu horn and the chanting, a strange noise which comes from inside the earth itself, as though the rocks and the soil were singing as best they could. The infinite possibilities of Masai life, on the face of it a simple desire to wander the earth following the cattle, have been denied. Every single thing the Masai value depends upon this possibility. This is the object of life. It is life. Uitsmijter, under the academic compulsion to explain, adds a note about the nature of prophecy among the Masai and — the comparative method — among other tribes such as the Dinka and the Nuer. Prophecy is expected of the laibons. It is usually expressed in the vaguest terms, like a horoscope in the newspapers. Another disciple of Nostradamus, S. O. Letterman, has been throwing the pebbles in LA and finds the omens good. So far no progress with the female lead. But Mel Gibson likes the treatment, which Letterman himself has had to work up  a little. In principle he would like to do the movie, but you know how it is with agents. (I don't, as a matter of fact, but this is the chummy method at work.) In many ways the time is right — fiftieth anniversary, uncertainties in the world, French self-examination and so on— for just such a movie. It feels right. The response is good. He is off to Paris to interview actresses. This sounds like a wonderful opportunity for Letterman to bring to bear his feminine understanding on eager actresses, although something tells me that his Californian slightly-absurd-boyish-middle-aged charm will not go down well in Paris. I wonder if what Mencken called ‘the usual hypocrisies’ aren't too well understood by women in Paris. I am sure that Letterman would like to have some of Polanski's assurance with young women, a knowingness which makes the Californian mania for self-presentation look quaint. The success — I am looking out of the window at the thickly carpeted mountainside — comes from the knowledge of shared weakness, the weakness of both men and women in matters of sex and passion. It does not arise, as Letterman imagines, from impressing on women your sympathy and sensitivity to their imagined plight. This is why bastards continue to score heavily with women who should know better. For all his working of the flesh and his golden suntan and his deployment of pop philosophies and credos, Letterman is too contrived an individual to be successful with the sort of Frenchwoman — my gaze descends from the mountain to my backyard where they are pegging out a goatskin — whom he desires to play the part of Claudia. But I can't be sure."
FIC FIC-G01-039 -0.2 "77 Scott looked up as he heard the key turn in the lock. The heavy iron door swung open and a man stepped into the  cell, the door hurriedly closing behind him. The sound of the turning lock seemed deafening. ‘Scott, right?’ said Mike Robinson, crossing to his own bunk. ‘Jim Scott?’ He nodded. ‘How do you know my name?’ he wanted to know. Robinson smiled. ‘The same way we know what you're in for,’ he said. ‘There isn't much we don't know about in here. At least when it comes to other members of the population.’ His smile faded. ‘Besides, it pays to know a few things about a bloke you're going to be sharing with, especially when that bloke's topped three other geezers.’ Scott looked at him angrily. ‘I didn't kill them,’ he said. ‘I was set up.’ Robinson crossed to the small washbasin in the corner of the cell and spun the taps. ‘Yeah,’ he muttered humourlessly. ‘You and everybody else in here. We're all innocent, Scott. We were all fitted up.’ The smile returned. ‘It's the truth. I didn't kill those men,’ Scott insisted. ‘Look, I'm one of your cell mates, not a fucking jury, and it's a bit late to start pleading innocence, isn't it?’ Robinson dried his hands on the towel. ‘I don't care if you killed three or three hundred. The only thing I care about is that I've got to share a cell with you. So if you cut your toenails don't leave them lying around on the floor, don't make too much noise if you have to use the slop bucket at night and if you're a shit-stabber then I'll tell you now, my arsehole isn't for rent. Right? I don't care how much snout, cash or force you use, my ring-piece is out of fucking bounds and if you try anything I'll cut your heart out.’ Scott looked impassively at him, a slight grin on his face. ‘You trying to say I'm queer?’ he said quietly. ‘No, I'm just telling you that if you are then you're going to have a long love affair with your right hand because I'm straight and so is Rod. But there's plenty in here who aren't. If you want to find them, good hunting.’ ‘Who's Rod?’ ‘Rod Porter. The other bloke in this cell. He's on work detail at the moment.’ Robinson swung himself up onto his bunk and pulled a magazine from beneath his pillow. Scott regarded him impassively for a moment. ‘You know enough about me ,’ he said. ‘Who are you ?’ ‘Mike Robinson.’ Scott extended his hand in greeting. Robinson regarded it cautiously for a moment, then shook it, feeling the power in the other man's grip. Scott squeezed more tightly, the muscles in his forearm standing out like chords. When he finally released his grip, Robinson's hand felt numb but he managed to hide the discomfort. ‘You got life, didn't you?’ he said. Scott nodded. Jesus, even the words made him shiver. Life. ‘What else do you know about me?’ he asked. ‘In the real world you worked for Ray Plummer,’ Robinson told him. ‘And just a word of warning on that score. There are a couple of Ralph Connelly's boys in here who weren't too happy when they heard you'd blown away three of their mates.’ ‘I didn't kill them,’ Scott snapped. ‘Sorry, I forgot. You're innocent,’ Robinson said. ‘Whatever the case, watch your back with Connelly's boys. I'll point them out to you when I get the chance.’ Scott nodded. ‘You done time before?’ Robinson asked. Scott shook his head. ‘What about you?’ he wanted to know. Robinson smiled. ‘I've been in and out since I was ten,’ he said with something bordering on pride. ‘Remand homes, detention centres, borstals and nicks. They're all much the same. It's usually just the screws who are different. The ones here are okay, as far as screws go. It's the Governor who's the real cunt.’ He described Nicholson briefly, and mentioned particularly his words before the visit of the prison delegation. Scott sat on the edge of his own bed listening intently, hands clasped on his knees. Robinson was still giving him the low-down on life in Whitely when the key rattled in the door again and it opened to admit Rod Porter. He was wearing a white overall on top of his grey prison issue clothes and he pulled the overall off as soon as he was inside. Scott noticed there were bloodstains on it. ‘Hard day at the office, dear?’ chuckled Robinson as Porter crossed to the sink and began splashing his face with water. He finally turned and looked at Scott. ‘Well,’ he said. ‘I suppose a murderer is better company than a ponce.’ He extended his right hand. A token of greeting. Scott shook it. Brief introductions were made and Porter explained about their last cell-mate, just as he had to the prison delegation. ‘There's just one thing, Rod,’ Robinson said, still smiling. ‘Old Jim here is innocent. He didn't kill those three blokes. He was framed.’ Porter smiled. ‘How many fucking times do I have to tell you?’ snarled Scott. ‘It wasn't me who killed them.’ There was fury in his eyes. ‘The cheque's in the post, I love you and I promise not to come in your mouth,’ Porter added. ‘They're the three most common lies, mate. Except inside and you just added the fourth. We're all fucking innocent. I don't know why they don't just open the gates and let us all out now.’ ‘Fuck you,’ Scott rasped. ‘You don't have to,’ said Porter. ‘A jury already did that. They fucked me, Mike and you and everyone else in this shithole. There's no virgins in here. The law fucked everybody.’ Robinson chuckled. ‘Very philosophical,’ he said. Porter stretched out on his bunk, hands clasped behind his head. ‘So what do you think of the hotel?’ he said. Scott shrugged. He felt cold, as if all the warmth had been sucked from his body. He sat down on his own bed, exhaling deeply. Life. He nodded in the direction of the balled-up overall Porter had been wearing. ‘What's that for?’ he wanted to know. ‘Work detail,’ Porter explained. ‘Laundry. I collect it and deliver it. It s better than sitting in here every day. Apart from the hospital wing.’ He grunted. ‘That's where the blood came from. Blood, shit and Christ knows what else. It used to be used as a punishment: they'd make inmates clean up the hospital wing, that sort of thing. Even make them change sheets and empty fucking bedpans.’ ‘What did anybody do to get that punishment?’ Scott wanted to know. ‘It was usually if somebody tried to escape,’ Porter said. Escape. ‘Has anyone ever managed it?’ Scott wanted to know. ‘Not since I've been here,’ Porter told him. ‘A couple of blokes tried to go over the wall about a year ago. Before that, some prat even managed to hide in the boot of one of the warders’ cars.’ The other two men laughed. ‘Somebody did it a while back,’ Robinson said. ‘Actually got out. They didn't get far, of course, but they managed to get out of the prison itself…’ ‘How?’ Scott demanded, cutting him short. ‘This place is very old, as you know. Supposedly there's a network of sewer tunnels running under it,’ Robinson explained. ‘Most of them have probably caved in by now. But one old boy over in B Wing was telling me that it's like a fucking maze down there. Some geezer got down into the tunnels and found his way out.’ ‘Rather him than me,’ Porter muttered. ‘That was probably how they found him. Just followed the smell of shit.’ Robinson laughed. Scott didn't . He sat back on his bed, looking around at the confines of the cell. Life. He sucked in a deep breath, closing his eyes momentarily. A vision of Carol filled his mind. Then Plummer. He gritted his teeth. ‘You all right?’ Porter asked. Scott nodded slowly, opening his eyes. When he spoke his words were almost inaudible. ‘I was just thinking.’ LI FE. The word screamed inside his brain. No. There had to be a way ."
FIC FIC-G0Y-008 -0.16 "12 I suppose, Helen thought, that the interesting thing about my condition is the loss of self-control. Eventually one will see this as interesting rather than demoralising. It will be possible to look back and observe that those in love become utterly self-destructive. Oneself in love. At the moment I can no longer act with common sense and deliberation, because there is only one course open, and that is determined by obsession. I am obsessed by Giles; all I can think of is whether I shall see him again, and when. What the outcome of seeing him might be is beside the point; I have become incapable of calculation. Normally behaviour — or at least my behaviour — is governed by certain processes; weighing one course of action against another, thinking about consequences. In this predicament, one does nothing of the kind. One responds to some basic drive, like an animal. In youth, I found this exhilarating, I remember. She tried, as therapy, to recall previous experiences. She was probably, she realised, shorter on this than most people. Apart from that early sexual encounter, which did not count as love, there had been Peter Datchett and two others. With Peter Datchett, it had been a question of ripening interest rather than obsession. The others, in so far as she could recover her feelings of the time, seemed to have involved love — inflammation of the senses, certainly. At eighteen — the period of the mousseline de soie dress — she had found herself hanging around a certain area of Twickenham, where they were then living, in the hopes of encountering the doctor's son, with whom she had had a strangled conversation at some social gathering. He had subsequently taken her to the cinema, where she had been startled to feel his hand creep into hers. Four weeks later she had seen him in the  cinema queue with another girl, and had perceived that her day was over; in between, she had known disorientation and obsession, diagnosed her trouble, and felt exhilarated. Later, in her twenties, she had become quietly and patiently infatuated with a married colleague. The man had never behaved towards her in other than a friendly and decorous way; nevertheless, she burned. When after a year he moved away to another job, she felt acute distress and thought continuously of him for many months. It was that experience, in recollection, which most closely reflected her present state. Late one afternoon Giles came into the library. Helen had taken over the ‘Returned Books’ counter temporarily from one of the juniors and looked up to find him standing in front of her, smiling. He held up empty hands. ‘I'm not a customer. Nothing to declare. But I did have something in mind — a biography of Mahler.’ ‘We have Donald Mitchell. I'm not sure if it's on the shelf. You'll find it in…’ ‘I'd hoped for personal service,’ said Giles. Helen glanced round. ‘When Janice comes back from her tea I can hand over here.’ ‘Good. I'll fend for myself till then.’ Five minutes later she joined him in the Biography alcove. ‘I'm sorry I was out when you phoned — Edward did remember to tell me this time.’ ‘Did I phone? Yes, so I did — this week has been hectic, though not in any interesting way. Nothing to report on your mother's affairs, I'm afraid. Now — what do you advise? Mahler is out. Shall I embark on two volumes of Henry James?’ They discussed books for a few minutes. Giles made his selection. He glanced at his watch. ‘I must be off. Choir night, so I get myself an early supper. Thank you for your invaluable help — what luck to find you. I was afraid I might have struck one of the days you aren't here.’ There was to be no arrangement made, then. Choir night. Helen thought of the dark woman; in the mind's eye she saw her — laughing and talking with Giles. She felt a gust of despair. For  a moment she was quite faint; the library rocked around her — the browsing readers with shopping baskets set down beside them, the books in their bright rows, the humming strip lights. She took a deep breath, gathered herself, the room settled; Giles was tucking his pile of books under his arm, picking up his briefcase. She said, ‘Then what were you telephoning about?’ ‘About?’ He looked at her in surprise. And something else: something chilly, something that warned. Stop, she told herself, stop. And continued. ‘If there's nothing to report…’ ‘Oh,’ said Giles. ‘Yes… Let me see now, what did I have in mind? Mahler, perhaps. And to say thank you for that lovely picnic. I was telling Edward about the heron we saw.’ He was about to go; he turned to her. Well — goodbye, my dear, he was about to say, so glad I found you. And would be gone, leaving her to stare into blank days ahead. No, she thought, no. ‘I should like to see you,’ she said. ‘Helen… Of course.’ He laid a hand on her arm, placating. ‘Very soon. It's difficult to talk here, isn't it? And I have the blessed choir. We must organise something — very soon.’ ‘And you've given me the impression you wanted to see me, too.’ Appalled, she heard herself forge on. ‘But my dear…’ A woman edged past them into the alcove, murmuring apologies. Giles continued, his voice losing its solicitous intimacy. ‘We must talk again. Soon. Definitely. And thank you again for your help.’ He smiled: a public, neutral smile. The woman looked at them for a moment over the book she had pulled from the shelf. He went. ‘I can never find R to Z,’ said the woman plaintively. ‘Something funny happens after P.’ Helen supplied assistance. She could hardly hear the woman's queries; her stomach twisted; his bland little words ticked in her head — soon, very soon. Well, said her mother, I should think you may have gone and done it now. She was having dreams of unabashed sexuality. It was not Giles, though, who featured in these dreams. She consorted, these  nights, with strangers — men who were temporarily vivid when she awoke but who faded as the day progressed until, after a few hours, they vanished entirely. Since the picnic, the young man by the river had joined her twice; she herself, interestingly, had not been the Helen of today but her own younger self and indeed not even that — some other girl who was both alien and deeply familiar, a doppelgänger , a mirror-Helen. She had bathed naked from a deserted beach with this man, and lain with him afterwards among sand-dunes. In the morning, while the dream remained with her, she felt searingly deprived, as though she had been abandoned, as though she had lost someone known and loved. And the loss was in part the loss of some aspect of herself, as irretrievable as past happiness. She remembered that somewhere Dorothy had kept old photograph albums and, on a whim, began to search for them. They were not where she had expected to find them, in the big tallboy in the sitting room, in which lurked an unvisited confusion of old magazines, moth-eaten balls of knitting-wool, paper patterns, Edward's school reports, Louise's sketch pads, buttons, string. She ran them to ground eventually in the bottom of Dorothy's wardrobe, an area she had not yet steeled herself to clear. Pulling them from under some old blankets, she sat down on the bed and began to leaf through the pages: photographs fell out, battered, uncherished, not stuck-in — this was no lovingly tended relic. Here was a curly-haired Louise, smirking in a sunsuit on a grey, shingly beach; here was Edward in knee-length shorts, hair clipped to his scalp and ears sticking out. And here was Helen, a forgotten Helen with anxious chubby adolescent face, wearing a crumpled cotton dress and tilted sideways — her mother had been a careless photographer. All these prints, indeed, were under- or over-exposed, with their subjects askew; heads were chopped off, feet and hands loomed giant in the foregrounds. Nevertheless, photographs had been taken; there had been a deliberate attempt to record, to retain. Helen, shuffling through them, remembered Louise in the churchyard: even mother must have had the odd twinge… Here was her father, too. Always on the edge of things. He stood diffidently to the side of a group, or featured as a  background — the pair of legs clutched by baby Louise, a blurred figure in a field beyond Helen and Edward who sat on a rug eating sandwiches. That particular snap prompted the memory, the afternoon returning as she stared at it — the sandwiches had been of marmite, Edward had found a hawk-moth caterpillar. But what was their father doing, lurking indistinctly over there under a tree? That Helen could not remember. And nowhere did he appear alone: never, it seemed, had Dorothy turned the viewfinder of the old box Brownie deliberately upon her husband. Equally, she was absent herself; naturally enough — she had been the photographer. At the back of the album was a clutch of glossy professional pictures, and in these Dorothy could be found, glaring out from Louise's wedding group, standing rigid beside Edward on his graduation day. For both occasions she had worn the same hat — an uncompromising chenille turban; Helen had disposed of it a month ago with the rest of her things and, as she looked at the photographs, felt again the curious dry but slimy touch of it. And there also, in an earlier picture, was the brown bear fur coat: Dorothy, flanked by Helen and Edward as children, stood on a pavement against a background of London taxis and buses — they must have been caught by a street photographer on one of those pantomime or ballet outings. Dorothy looked determined rather than festive; she would have been in her forties at the time but already stood as though planted, like an elderly woman. She had never seemed young, Helen realised; not even in the haziest reaches of recollection. But it was not for Dorothy that she searched, nor even for her father. She hunted herself, putting aside all those pictures in which she appeared — not as child but as a grown woman. There were not so many. The sequence ended abruptly in the late fifties; the camera had packed up. Helen could even remember the occasion; the shutter jamming, her mother's fit of temper, the thing flung into the dustbin. And never, of course, replaced; such a purchase would have been an unjustifiable extravagance. The last photograph of herself showed her at about twenty-five, here in the garden at Greystones, sorting apples into baskets. Clearly Dorothy's principal intention had been to record the apple harvest — a prodigious one; Helen's presence was incidental, like one of those figures introduced for purposes of scale or composition. But she had turned her face to the camera and it had caught a look that she could find nowhere else and indeed that seemed to belong to another girl; she barely recognised herself. She saw a person who was young, yes, but — more than that — who wore an expression of arresting vivacity and expectancy. And who looked thus at her mother — what had she seen? Of what had she been thinking? Helen turned the picture over and saw that Dorothy had pencilled on the back ‘18 lbs Laxtons; 27 lbs Coxes.’ One of those trees had blown over in a storm a few years later; the other survived as a diseased and sterile relic. She sat on her mother's bed and studied her own distant and alien face. The eyes, indeed, met hers — alive, expectant, vulnerable. She felt as though confronted by a child: it'll be all right, she wanted to say, I'll see that it's all right. A letter came from Giles: a typed, official letter concerning her mother's affairs. But folded within it was a handwritten note ‘So good to see you at the library, albeit briefly. Though I thought you seemed not quite yourself, and trust all is well now — do let me know if there is anything I can do. Yours affec. Giles.’ What am I supposed to make of this? she wondered. And with the thought came a spurt of irritation. I am supposed to make anything, or nothing, of it; obscurity and ambiguity are built in, whether deliberately or because that is his habit. Just as he has behaved since we met in a manner that avoids interpretation. She telephoned that evening, before she could change her mind. She picked up the receiver without planning what she would say. ‘This is Helen.’ There was no hesitation, no coolness to his voice. ‘How nice and how are you? You've had my letter? As I explained — we should be able to get those shares transferred next month, and then you can go ahead and sell them, or re-invest or whatever you wish. It might be as well to…’ ‘I understand,’ she said. ‘And thank you for your note.’ ‘Ah…’ ‘There is, in a sense, something you can do. Perhaps we could meet.’ Giles said at once, ‘Of course . Let's see… Tomorrow? What about tomorrow — Saturday? I am bespoke in the evening, but the daytime is free, once I've done my domestic chores. Why don't we have a pub lunch and a breath of fresh air somewhere pleasant?’ He had suggested the landscaped grounds of an eighteenth-century house, noted for their expression of the picturesque: ‘I'm not a great one for stately homes, but you can have a good walk there.’ They had lunched in a crowded riverside pub, where Giles had talked smoothly and continuously on a general level. He continued to talk thus now, as they walked down the grand vista, away from the formal gardens and into the woodland rides, where classical figures loomed from the undergrowth and the serpentine rill wound away towards a distant temple. They stopped at the balustraded terrace overlooking the small lake, and leaned over; below, enormous golden fish lay around in the green water. ‘Carp?’ wondered Giles. ‘Or orfe, are they? There's something called an orfe, isn't there?’ Helen said, ‘I think I should find myself another solicitor.’ She had not considered the words; they arrived, simply, and once said, seemed right. He turned to her. She saw him, for the first time ever, startled. There was a sudden nakedness to his face. Then the nakedness was covered: he had seen what lay ahead. He said, with deliberate care, ‘But of course, my dear, if you feel we are not coming up to scratch. You have a perfect right.’ ‘It's nothing to do with professional things. It's because I am in love with you.’ There was a silence. ‘Oh dear, oh dear,’ said Giles. He sounded entirely artificial. He looked down at the fish. ‘My dear Helen…’ ‘Which is my fault,’ said Helen. ‘But it makes life difficult. And I have to say that although what I feel is my fault, and my responsibility, you have, up to a point, encouraged me. Or at least you have left me not knowing what to think.’ Giles sighed. ‘Then I am to blame. Please let me say, Helen, that I have the very greatest affection and respect for you. Please realise that. I value your friendship enormously, and I'd hoped to continue to do so.’ She watched the fish. Carp, or orfe. They lay at angles to each other, drifting very slowly so that the gold-splintered pattern of the lake changed continuously. She heard what he said and she thought, so that is how it is, and how it is going to be. She felt nothing very much, except the sense of moving inexorably from one moment to the next, and accepting what each brought. She followed the slow gyration of one very large, cream-coloured fish and said, ‘But you aren't in love with me, which would make it, I'm afraid, an awkward friendship. Of course, my feelings may change — I'm well aware of that — in which case all this will seem rather silly. I'll probably wish I'd never mentioned the matter, but it seems necessary to me at the moment, so there it is. What isn't very important to you has become important to me — disturbingly important. There is an imbalance, and I feel that I can't allow it to go on. For my own sake, I suppose.’ It was surprising how easily the words came, now that she had allowed them. She did not look at Giles at all as she spoke and the sentences piled one upon another, without restraint, like a flow of thought; there was even a low level of enjoyment in the sense of release. ‘Another woman would cope with this differently, I daresay. You have appeared at a time when things are rather…odd. For me, I mean. Maybe that's partly why I've reacted like this. I'm conscious of not abiding by rules, in saying all this. You'd much prefer that I didn't.’ She caught, out of the corner of her eye, his gesture of disagreement. He started to speak but she interrupted. ‘Don't think, though, that I am dishing out blame. The problem is — has been — that what was one thing to you was quite another to me. Probably I misinterpreted, from time to time. Thought you meant things you didn't mean.’ She paused, and Giles leapt in at once. ‘I am at fault. The  trouble is…my trouble is… Oh dear. I'm susceptible, I suppose. Even now I'm finding your honesty charming. Does this really have to end our friendship? Surely not. As you rightly say, your feelings may change. Oh — will change, certainly.’ Was there an edge of doubt or complacency to his tone? ‘I don't really think,’ said Helen, ‘that either of us would feel very comfortable after this.’ Giles sighed. ‘You're so much nicer than I am, Helen. You make me seem insincere. But I'm not, you know. I'm just…well, I meet someone like you with whom I feel instant affinity, to whom I'm instantly attracted and… I get carried away, I suppose. It isn't insincerity. It's…susceptibility. A weakness, I suppose, but there we are.’ He turned on her a rueful expression — rueful but placating, like a boy caught out in a misdemeanour. She was to be wrong-footed, she saw: made to feel ponderous, portentous. ‘I never saw you as insincere. Merely perplexing, at times. At least perplexing to me, but that is probably to do with my own shortcomings. In relationships, that is. That's what I mean by things being different for you than for me.’ She was watching the fish again. And now she caught him in another gesture, but a surreptitious one this time — the quick shooting of a cuff to glance at his watch. At some other level of consciousness she registered amazement, a flick of anger, and the distant recognition of her own recovery: eventually, she would remember that movement. A pair of collared doves were moaning in the trees overhead; the day was absolutely still — sunless and oppressive. Giles laid his hand on her arm. ‘You know, I have this feeling that too much introspection will get us nowhere. Shall we move? I'm getting rather tired of these fish.’ They walked on into the thickening woodland. Giles still had his hand under her elbow; she stopped to adjust the strap of her sandal as a pretext to shake it off. I can get through all this, she thought, so long as he doesn't touch me. I think I can. They were following the concrete channel of the serpentine rill, which emptied itself into a pool of stygian blackness. Giles paused to peer into it. ‘No fish. Really, this place can be  extraordinarily melancholy on occasion. Perhaps I shouldn't have brought you here.’ ‘I would have said what I have if we'd gone to a fun-fair,’ said Helen. He laughed. ‘There! That's what's so engaging about you but of course you're the one person who can't see that. I hope I am not to be cast absolutely into the outer darkness, Helen — I should find that very wretched.’ I see, she thought, he is to be the one who is rejected; that is how it is to be. They came out into the open. A little temple presided over a sloping hillside with a prospect of open fields and river lined with reeds and willows. A pair of swans cruised, with cygnets, and swallows were zipping to and fro above the water. Giles said, ‘Something's on fire.’ ‘Stubble burning.’ Helen realised now that the sky was overcast not by cloud but by hanging palls of smoke. The edges of the landscape fumed. At the far end of the valley, beyond the river and the water-meadows, was a rim of red; they could hear crackling. ‘It's a disgrace,’ said Giles. ‘It's been allowed to get quite out of hand. There should be new legislation.’ They walked on, past a classical arcade, past an Apollo and a sequence of nymphs. Waterlilies swung at the edge of the river; willows rained down. The air was now quite acrid; Helen saw that the sleeve of her shirt was covered with dark specks of ash. Giles was talking of childhood holidays in Devon; hayfields filled with wild flowers, corn-sheaves, butterflies. A vanished countryside. And horse-drawn waggons and smocked farmworkers, I daresay, thought Helen: everything is embroidered by recollection. Even today, no doubt. Eventually. They reached the car. He drove her back to Greystones, still talking fluently of things that mattered not at all. As he opened the door of the car for her to get out he smiled, a smile that appeared eloquent both of regret and appeal. Then he laid his hand on her shoulder for an instant, got back into the driving-seat, and was gone. She walked up the path towards the front door. You could  smell burning here, too. The sky above the Britches was sepia-coloured, as though a storm were imminent. She registered all this, opened the front door and knew also, immediately, that there was something alien about the house. She called ‘Edward?’, and then remembered that he had gone out with the ornithological group. She walked into the kitchen and Phil was sitting at the table. He got up. His green crest, she saw, was now tinged with brown at the roots. So it did grow out. He looked extremely unhealthy; the anxious eyes of a child peered at her from a white mask. He said ‘The front door was locked, so I got through the window at the back. Edward wasn’ here either.’ Helen removed her coat and filled the kettle. She felt an unusual surging lust for a cup of tea. ‘We weren't expecting you, Phil.’ ‘I thought I'd come and stay here for a bit. You and Edward don’ min', do you? I mean, I thought since it's my house, sort of, it would be all right. But if you don' wan' me I'll go somewhere else. I mean, I don' care one way or the other. Fact is, I'm a bit pissed off at home.’ He watched her, tensely; his eyes were those of a five-year-old. She took two cups and saucers from the dresser and put them on the table; she got the milk from the fridge. ‘That's all right. You can stay if you want to. I'll find some sheets presently and you can make up a bed in the spare room. But I do think you should tell your parents. Ask your parents,’ she amended. ‘That's fine,’ said Phil. ‘I rung mum. She said it sounds like a good idea, till I get myself together.’ ‘She did, did she?’ said Helen in a different tone. The kettle spurted. She made the tea, poured two cups. ‘Thanks,’ said Phil. Helen took a gulp of tea, and felt herself begin to rally. She looked at Phil; he was encased from top to toe in black leather, as always. ‘Don't you want to take your jacket off — you must be awfully hot?’ Phil, vaguely, shrugged off the jacket which fell to the floor with a metallic clatter. Beneath it he wore a T-shirt of quite astonishing filthiness. ‘The thing is, I'm not getting on with Mum and Dad. I mean, we're all pissed off with each other.’ ‘That can happen.’ ‘I ‘spect,’ he continued magnanimously, ‘s'partly my fault too.’ ‘I daresay,’ said Helen. After a moment she added, with sudden hope ‘What about school? Surely the term starts soon.’ ‘I can't remember,’ said Phil evasively. ‘Anyway, that's not important. The thing is to get myself together. I got problems.’ Helen refilled both cups. Phil slurped his with one gulp. He seemed restored; his crest stood perkily again. ‘I got to sort myself out, see.’ ‘Well,’ said Helen. ‘We've all got problems, but you're welcome to stay here for a bit.’ Phil looked at her over his cup with kindly reproach. He ignored the first part of her statement. ‘Thanks, Helen.’ ‘Actually,’ said Louise, ‘it's the perfect solution. I don't know why I didn't think of it myself. I mean, you and Edward aren't involved emotionally like we are, and he's not going to get up your nose in the same way and I'll know where he is and that he's all right. It's the obvious arrangement. At least he rang. Though of course you would have done anyway. Not that he was what you'd call forthcoming. A series of grunts, which is mainly what I get these days. There are points when I wonder if he actually hates me, or if he's not yet got beyond the level of contempt and indifference. I look at him — when I can bear to and frankly if you can persuade him to use a clean T-shirt you'll be doing all of us a favour — I look at him and I remember dear little chubby hands clutching one, and the way their faces used to smell of soap and milk. What happened to all that? Anyway, at least he rang. Maybe it indicates some normal human responses. And I'll know where he is and roughly what he's up to. Though…is there a drug scene in the village yet? All right, I daresay you don't — but there's no need to snap, I have been pretty well at the end of my tether. You don't know what it's like wondering what the hell he's up to now and where he's gone and when he'll be back. And the grunts and the glares and the  slammed doors and that bloody T-shirt. Do try and get him to eat some decent food. And keep me informed. Unless of course he deigns to ring again himself. You might point out that one has feelings. Anyway… So how are things with you?’ ‘How long for?’ said Edward. It was Helen who made up the spare room bed, in the end. Phil, it appeared, had spent his life under a duvet; the technical problem posed by sheets and blankets defeated him. He dumped himself in the battered armchair and watched her, chatting cosily the while. He seemed to have taken on a new lease of life. ‘I like it here. S'a nice house. S'not smart. I don’ like smart houses. Actually, that's what I like about you and Edward. You're not smart either. Not like Mum and Dad's friends. They know some shocking people, really shocking.’ ‘Mmn. Could you pass me that pillow.’ ‘All right if I put up some posters? S'a bit boring the way it is, this room.’ ‘I suppose so. I can't think quite what you're going to find to do here, you know, Phil.’ ‘You don’ need to worry about me,’said Phil reassuringly. ‘I'll probably be spending quite a lot of time writing poetry.’ ‘Oh. I see. What sort of poetry do you write?’ ‘Protest poetry, mos'ly,’ said Phil in a business-like tone. ‘Edward won’ min' if I borrow his typewriter, will he?’ She had given tea to Phil. Had drunk tea herself, telephoned Louise, taken Edward aside and explained, made up the spare room bed. And all through this she did not think of Giles. She did not take those hours out and contemplate them; she simply let them lie somewhere in the head, to surface no doubt at some point of low resistance. The small hours of the morning, conventionally. From time to time that evening she was visited by the sight of the lake with its gold fretwork of fish; she wondered how  many years it would be before she could go to that place with equanimity. And, thinking this, she knew that the thought itself was the first, faint, early signal of recovery. It was as though, at the height of a fever, you experienced a fleeting moment of wellbeing. Eventually, she thought, it will all be over. I shan't care. But before then there is a long way to go. Now, tonight, there is nothing to look forward to, no reason to get up in the morning or move from one day into the next. I have been someone else these last few months; now I have to learn to be myself again."
FIC FIC-GUU-002 -0.18 "Chapter 6 ‘WEIGHER TAKING A box at the Coliseum tomorrow evening, Georgina Newley announced to Celia Prentisse and William Dougal. ‘Salome. It should be such fun. Now you will come, won't you?’ ‘I only wish I could,’ William said. ‘Unfortunately I've got a meeting with Verrall — he's the man who's fronting the documentary.’ ‘I see. But you can manage it, can't you, Celia?’ Celia smiled and said she could. For an instant she had been tempted to get out of the invitation with a lie. But she had an old-fashioned regard for the truth; and besides it was time that she gave Strauss another chance. ‘Ivor!’ Georgina called across the crowded room. ‘Celia can come tomorrow but William can't.’ Newley pantomimed pleasure and regret. Since Arabella had died, he had been remarkably docile with Georgina. Celia found it unnerving. ‘Poor little Goo-Goo can't come, can he?’ Georgina informed her dachshund. ‘Still, he can guard the house for Mummy and Daddy, can't he?’ The dachshund slunk out of the room. Celia felt slightly sick. She loathed the way some childless people treated their pets as surrogate children. Her loathing was partly due to the suspicion that, in a similar situation, she might do the same. ‘We shall be formal, of course,’ Georgina said reverting to her usual manner. ‘I feel very strongly that someone should set an example. After all, there are occasions and occasions.’ She moved away to talk to Eustace Tolby who had come with his wife, an elegant Asian woman. ‘Do you think,’ William asked, ‘that Salome will be an occasion or an occasion?’ ‘Probably both, if Georgina's got anything to do with it.’ He looked at his watch. ‘Let's go and see the coins.’ The collection was arranged in Newley's study, off the drawing-room. The room contained two hard chairs, a desk and an upright piano. The coins were displayed in locked glass cases. The more valuable pieces were normally kept in a safe, Newley told them. He showed them around personally, introducing the coins as though they were friends. Each exhibit had a neatly typed label. Newley thawed in the face of William's obvious interest. He discussed with mounting enthusiasm the siege coinage of Charles I. ‘There's a fascinating variety of design, even of shape. Look at the Newark half-crown for example: a lozenge. Or that octagonal shilling from Pontefract.’ William bent down to examine it. ‘That's interesting: Charles II, yet the date is 1648.’ ‘That's because —’ The telephone began to ring. ‘Damn.’ Newley picked up the study extension. As he listened, his face went grey with shock. He rang off. ‘That was the police. We've got to clear the house. A gas main's ruptured and they're afraid of an explosion. Will you tell everyone? I want to get the coins.’ He was already unlocking the cases. Celia went into the drawing-room and announced the news. The babble of conversation stopped. Georgina ran from the room, crying ‘Goo-Goo! Goo-Goo!’ Her departure created a subdued panic. People elbowed past each other to the door. Their expressions were drained of personality which gave them the family resemblance possessed by a flock of sheep. Celia tugged at William's hand. He didn't move. She glanced at him, noticing that he was staring back through the partly open door of the study. ‘Come on, William.’ He smiled at her, took her arm and led her to the window. They were the first outside. On the following night Dougal and Lorton decided against taking the car; the distance from Lorton's house to the Newleys' was only a few hundred yards. They would be less conspicuous if they walked. The streets were still sprinkled with people. It was a little after nine o'clock. Lorton was carrying a bag over his shoulder and humming under his breath. Dougal was silent. His nervousness had grown steadily all day. Tonight was the Rubicon; afterwards there would be no going back. He tried to bolster his courage by reciting the reasons for what he was doing: go per cent of them boiled down to a pressing need for money, so pressing that the bank was threatening to foreclose on his mortgage; the other lo per cent was divided between the desire to do Lorton a good turn and the feeling that the Newleys deserved whatever fate could throw at them. His courage refused to be bolstered. It was all very well conceiving these things in the abstract; the problems emerged when you tried to put them into practice. Lorton stopped humming. ‘You've done this sort of thing before, haven't you?’ he said softly. ‘Not quite like this.’ ‘Does Celia know?’ ‘Of course she doesn't,’ Dougal snapped. ‘And I don't want her to.’ The very idea made him cringe inside. He promised himself that this would be the last time he strayed beyond the legally permitted limits in life-he couldn't risk the loss of Celia. He knew her too well to think that she would allow affection to outweigh her sense of right and wrong. Sometimes he thought that her simplistic morality was part of the reason why he loved her. Perhaps alien was a more accurate word than simplistic. The road was a cul-de-sac. Dougal regretted that it was empty of pedestrians and moving cars. He had no excuse for turning back. Even when he was trying to be a criminal, the low moral fibre shone through. As they reached the privet hedge fronting the Newleys' garden, he was fervently grateful to have a last-minute reprieve: the drawing-room curtains weren't thick enough to conceal the light behind them. ‘It's all right,’ Lorton said. ‘I saw them leave, and their car's not back. Gloves.’ The pulled on the rubber gloves. Dougal felt like a surgeon at the start of an operation which was doomed to failure. Lorton opened the gate. Dougal followed him into the little garden. They walked silently along the side wall of the house. The concrete paths had been cleared of snow and ice. There was no need to talk. Both of them knew the layout of the house, and they had planned their movements in exhaustive detail. The dining-room had a Victorian sash window which was loose in its frame. Lorton slid back the catch with a thin-bladed knife and raised the lower half. Dougal heard him sigh softly with relief. There had been a strong possibility that the Newleys would have turned the security locks as well. In that case they would have had to break the glass. Lorton passed the bag to Dougal and balanced himself on the sill, with his legs outside the house. Dougal held on to him. Goo-Goo began to bark; his claws rattled on the dining-room door. Before he joined NCPR Lorton had worked in the personnel department of a firm which marketed burglar alarms. He reached down to the floor and folded back the carpet. Despite the cold, Dougal was sweating under his coat. Lorton hooked a leg over and climbed into the room. He turned back to Dougal. ‘Come in slowly. I'll keep your feet away from the pressure pad.’ According to Lorton, the Newleys' burglar-alarm system was ten or fifteen years old and long overdue for retirement. Dougal wished he could share his confidence. The reflections from the street lamps gave them just enough light to see what they were doing. Dougal took an old newspaper and a bowl from the bag. He laid out the newspaper on the carpet and stripped off the bowl's clingfilm covering. It contained a pound of raw stewing steak, laced with Seconal for good measure. Goo-Goo's greed was legendary, and he was reputed to be a messy eater. Let sleeping dogs lie. Lorton opened the door, and the dachshund rushed in, yapping furiously. Dougal caught his collar and rammed his head into the meat. The transformation from faithful guard-dog to quivering glutton was almost instantaneous. Lorton said: ‘I still think it would have been better to kill him.’ ‘No!’ Dougal hissed. They went through the hall and into the drawing-room. A single standard lamp was alight. The door to the study was ajar. Dougal was in front now. He had used an old trick last night — adapted from Conan Doyle's ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’. Lorton's phone call had succeeded perfectly, rather to Dougal's surprise. It remained to be seen whether Newley, like Irene Adler, had realized the purpose of the hoax. He ignored both the display cases and the safe which was concealed behind a framed eighteenth-century engraving of the City of London. Lorton helped him push the piano away from the wall. Dougal rolled back the carpet. Last night the piano had blocked his view, but he knew roughly where to look. He ran his hand over the parquet flooring until he found the area he wanted. Lorton passed him the knife. Dougal levered up the rectangle of hardwood. The small japanned box was still there. He lifted it out and replaced the block of wood. The box was reassuringly heavy. Lorton, who had been watching anxiously, gave him a nod of approval. They restored the carpet and the piano to their original positions. In the dining-room, Goo-Goo was just finishing his unexpected supper. He was too full to make more than a token protest when Lorton removed the bowl and rolled up the newspaper. A few seconds later, they were walking down the road. The whole operation had taken no more than a few minutes. ‘Who says crime doesn't pay?’ Lorton muttered. Dougal didn't answer. Crime has its expenses too. He was still trembling. Lorton put the box on the kitchen table and attacked the lock with an old chisel. Dougal threw away the newspaper and washed up the bowl. The lock was not designed for rough treatment. The lid flew up. Lorton emptied the contents on to the table. Dougal dried his hands and lit a cigarette. There were about thirty coins arranged in layers on cardboard trays; each tray was encased in a plastic wallet. Beneath the coins were some papers. Dougal bent down for a closer look. ‘We really need Seaby's Standard Catalogue of British Coins for this. I think that's a James I half-angel…that's a William-and-Mary half-guinea… God knows what that is…there's a rarity, an Edward VIII threepence; out of period but who cares?…ah!’ He pointed at a gold coin. ‘Fowler-Troon was right. It's the Jacobite Guinea.’ Lorton looked sharply at him. ‘I knew the bastard was bent.’ Dougal shrugged. At that moment they both heard the bang of the basement's front door. Celia was back from the opera. Lorton swept the coins together and crammed them into the box. ‘Come on,’ he said. ‘We'd better put this away.’ Dougal picked up the papers and followed Lorton upstairs. They went into the spare room and sat on the bed. Dougal unfolded one of the papers and quickly handed it to Lorton. Darling — Just a note to say I love you and I ‘m so glad. Always your Bella. Lorton leafed through the rest of the bundle, wondering if the hurt and humiliation would ever stop. All but one of the letters were in Arabella's handwriting. Most of them were short and crammed with endearments. Phrases leapt up and hit him with a force which was almost physical. I told Rod I was tired last night. I couldn't bear him fumbling over me after yesterday… The test is positive. I'm sure the baby's yours. They say women always know… He picked up the last letter. Dear Ivor, I tried to ring you before the taxi came. I'll try again from the airport, but this note will have to do if I can't get through. I ‘m delighted by your news for your sake, and for Arabella's, of course. But for God's sake don't do anything impulsive. Divorce is complicated enough in normal circumstances. Yours are anything but normal, partly because of the baby and partly because Georgina ‘s the major shareholder in the agency. And I imagine she's not a forgiving woman at the best of times. I ‘ll be back from the Gambia on Monday, and we can talk this through in detail. Until then, I really would advise you to do nothing. Even seeing Arabella might be unwise. We also need to consider Rod's position. All best wishes (to all three of you!) Eustace. He passed the solicitor's letter to Dougal, who glanced through it. ‘That's another thing Newley will want back. Tolby's letter, I mean.’ Lorton dragged his mind away from his private misery. ‘Why? Georgina already knows about the affair.’ ‘But she doesn't know that divorce was in the wind,’ Dougal said. ‘Nor the reason for it. It's a worse kind of betrayal. And she won't like the fact that Tolby's involved.’ ‘Nor do I,’ Lorton snarled. ‘Of course not.’ Dougal paused. ‘But it does give us a little more room for manoeuvre with Newley.’ ‘I don't want to manoeuvre. I want to kill him.’ When Celia got back from the opera, she was pleased to find the flat was empty. As she told herself several times, she was glad that she and William weren't living in one another 's pockets. William had said he might be late. He was meeting Gilbert Verrall, the presenter of a TV series called The Footsteps of Time. They had met originally when Verrall was writing a biography of Cromwell for which William had done much of the research. The projected documentary on the exiled Stuarts was Verrall's idea and he had commissioned William to do the spade-work. It was just as well. William seemed to have no other source of income at present. Celia had met Verrall once. He was a tall, well-groomed man in youthful middle age. He wore outsize glasses and talked excessively, usually about his work. William would be lucky to extricate himself before midnight. She tidied up the sitting-room, promising herself an early night with a book. It was curious how soon you grew used to the presence of another person in your home. The flat seemed empty without William. She kept thinking of things she wanted to tell him. For example, if he had to smoke in her flat, he could at least have the decency to empty the ashtray. The phone rang just as she had climbed into the bath. She wrapped a towel around her and ran to the sitting-room, swearing under her breath. Wet footprints trailed behind her. ‘Celia? Thank God!’ ‘Who is it?’ ‘It's me.’ The voice sounded annoyed by her question, as if instant recognition was no more than its due. ‘Something terrible's happened. Cyril's gone.’ Yorick burst into tears. Celia asked where Cyril had gone. There were goose pimples on her arm. She tried to light the gas fire but dropped the matches all over the hearthrug. ‘I don't know,’ Yorick wailed. ‘And I don't care. He just walked out with my best suitcases and half my wardrobe. I can't bear it, darling. You must come over.’ Celia ignored the last sentence. ‘Did you have a row?’ ‘Cyril was very unkind to me.’ Yorick sniffed. ‘I let him read some of The Journal of a Fallen Angel, as a special treat. No one else has seen a word. And he said some horrid things about it.’ The Journal was one of Yorick's most cherished schemes. After his comeback as a serious musician, he planned to launch a book on the astonished and admiring world. It was to be a mixture of diary, autobiography, drawings and philosophical statement. Celia had spent part of last week trying to find a publisher who was remotely interested in discussing it. ‘I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you —’ ‘He did. He was a perfect little bitch. He called it a wank.’ Yorick, unmanned by the memory, began to cry again. Celia managed to get a lighted match to the fire. ‘Perhaps he's not capable of appreciating something like that.’ Yorick turned down this attempt at consolation. ‘Oh Celia I'm so unhappy I could kill myself. I wish he was here.’ ‘I'm sure he'll be back.’ ‘Please come round. I've been looking at the knives again. God, they're so tempting. I mean, why not? Nobody wants me. Nobody cares a damn.’ ‘We all care about you,’ Celia said firmly. ‘I think the book's going to be marvellous. Everyone who buys Mishima will want Fallen Angel as well.’ ‘No, they won't,’ Yorick wailed. ‘But I'll show them. I really will kill myself.’ Celia knew she had to take the threat seriously. Yorick had attempted suicide three times in the last four years; and the last attempt had nearly succeeded. She begrudged the sympathy he demanded from her; and she suspected that he was knowingly manipulating her. Still, she couldn't take chances. ‘Now listen, Yorick, I care. I love you very much. I'll drive over right away. Just you hang on and I'll be there.’ ‘Oh Celia, thank God —’ Over the line she heard a door slam in Yorick's flat. Yorick gasped. ‘Cyril! Darling!’ There was a clatter as he dropped the handset. The endearments and other noises which followed made it quite clear that Yorick and Cyril were exploring to the full the dramatic possibilities of a reconciliation scene. Celia hung up the phone. She warmed up the bath water. She lay in the bath, wondering when William would come home."
FIC FIC-H9C-001 -0.23 "Chapter 5 Ranulf and Dame Agatha were waiting for him near the Galilee Gate, the young nun apparently enjoying an account of one of his manservant's many escapades in London. ‘Ranulf, we are ready? Dame Agatha?’ His man nodded and scowled. Solicitously he helped the young nun to mount, muttering under his breath about how certain clerks seemed to turn up when they were least expected or wanted. Corbett just grinned over his shoulder and led them out on to the beaten track down to the village of Woodstock. He felt tempted to continue through the village to visit the young Prince at Woodstock Palace but, considering what he had just learnt, thought he had better wait for a while. The day proved to be a pleasant one and Corbett, with Ranulf in tow, humming some filthy ditty, enjoyed the quiet ride down the winding country lane, the trees on either side forming a green canopy above their heads. The countryside was peaceful under a late autumn sun, the silence broken only by the liquid song of a bird, the chatter of insects and the loud buzz of honey-hunting bees. Dame Agatha, elegant in her light brown riding habit, sat sidesaddle on a small gentle cob from the priory stables. Corbett allowed their conversation to be as desultory as possible, wanting his companion to relax and feel safe in his presence. At last they reached the village and joined the rest of the crowd as they thronged towards the green in front of the parish church. They paused to watch the rustics, bedecked with scarves, ribbons and laces, dance and carouse around their makeshift hobby horses to the raucous noise of pipers, drummers and other musicians. Corbett assisted Dame Agatha to dismount. She pointed towards a large, two-storey building on the other side of the green. ‘I have business with the merchant who imports our wine,’ she remarked. ‘Afterwards I'll go to the church and meet you there.’ Corbett agreed, telling Ranulf to accompany her whilst he stabled their horses at The Bull. For a while he sat outside on one of the benches, ordering a pot of ale and relaxing in the sunshine. He looked again at the church and remembered Father Reynard's sermon. He went up through the wicket gate and into the cemetery, a quiet, surprisingly well-kept plot. The grass was scythed, the elm trees well-pruned and vigorous in their growth. Corbett went past the church towards the priest's house and knocked gently on the half-open door. He heard voices and Father Reynard suddenly appeared. ‘Come in! Come in!’ The friar's smile was welcoming and genuine. He told Corbett to sit on a bench and went back to where he and a young man, a villein from the village, were poring over a great leatherbound book open on the table. Corbett stared around. An unpretentious place: two rooms downstairs with possibly two small chambers above. The floor was of beaten earth, the walls washed white with lime to keep off the flies. A crude stone hearth, a few sticks of furniture, chests and coffers and a shelf full of kitchen implements were all the friar's apparent possessions. Corbett was impressed. Many village priests insisted on living in luxury, dressing in the best garb, jerkin and multi-coloured hose, and making every effort to palliate the hardships of their lives. A few were downright criminal: Corbett had seen cases in King's Bench of priests who used their churches to brew beer, as gambling dens, or even worse. At the table the young man murmured his pleasure at something Father Reynard had pointed out, shook the priest's hand and quickly left. Father Reynard closed the leatherbound book and placed it reverently back inside a huge ironbound chest. ‘The Blood Book,’ he observed, straightening up. ‘It says who marries whom in the village. The young man's betrothed is related to him but only in the seventh degree.’ He smiled. ‘I am glad I have made someone happy. Now, can I do the same for you?’ ‘A powerful sermon, Father. The sisters were uncomfortable.’ The priest frowned ‘They need to be reminded,’ he replied sharply. ‘What will they say when Christ comes and shows his red, wounded body to them? We are Christ's wounds,’ he continued, ‘the poor and the dispossessed, while the rich luxuriate in their comfortable sties.’ ‘Did you think Lady Eleanor was one of these rich?’ ‘I have told you already.’ ‘You were a soldier, Father?’ The priest sat down on the bench next to him. ‘Aye,’ he replied wearily. ‘A master bowman, a royal serjeant-at-arms. I have spilt my fair share of blood in Scotland, Wales and Gascony.’ He looked up. ‘I have pursued  the King's enemies by land and sea but now I understand, killing's no answer.’ ‘Surely, Father, sometimes it is?’ The priest rested his elbows on his knees and looked down at the floor. ‘Perhaps,’ he murmured. ‘If God wills it, perhaps. He told David to kill the Philistines and raised up heroes to defend his people.’ ‘Did you think the Lady Eleanor deserved to die?’ ‘Perhaps. Her sins pursued her but I was not her judge.’ ‘You were near Godstowe when she died. I understand, as a penance, you walk barefoot from your church here to the Galilee Gate, saying your beads and go back chanting the psalms. A strange practice, Father.’ The priest rubbed his face. ‘My sins,’ he murmured, ‘are always before me. My lusts, my drinking, my killing. How shall I answer to Christ for that, Clerk?’ He turned and stared at Corbett and the clerk glimpsed madness dancing in his eyes. A tormented man, Corbett concluded, struggling to break free from his own powerful emotions. ‘You were at Godstowe, Father? When on that Sunday?’ ‘The nuns were in Compline.’ Father Reynard edged closer and Corbett smelt his wine-drenched breath. ‘But I did not go into the priory, if that is what you are asking, Clerk. I would not lay hands on the Lady Eleanor, even though my eyes… ’ His voice trailed off. ‘Even though your eyes what, Father? You, a priest, found the Lady Eleanor attractive?’ The priest smiled, stretching out his great body and flexing his fingers. ‘Beautiful,’ he murmured. ‘Of all God's women… ’ He  shook his head, lost in his own thoughts. ‘One of the most comely I have seen.’ Corbett watched those hands. Powerful, calloused, sunburnt, they could have twisted the white swan neck of Lady Eleanor as easily as a twig. The friar took a deep breath ‘Do you know, Corbett, if you had insinuated what you are doing now before I became a friar, I would have killed you. I went as far as the Galilee Gate, I turned and came back to my church. I stayed in my house until Lady Arrogance, the Prioress, sent for me. I went to Godstowe, said a prayer for that poor woman's soul, gave her Christ's unction and left. But come, you can ask your other questions elsewhere. I have business in church.’ Corbett followed him out of the house. The friar's threats didn't unnerve him. Father Reynard was a man striving for sanctity, though he sensed the priest was hiding something, as if he wanted him out of the house before Corbett noticed anything amiss. The church was a hive of activity; some villagers had wheeled a huge cart into the nave. This was surmounted by a gilded griffin and bore a crudely painted canvas of hell's mouth. The other two sides were draped with coloured buckram to provide a makeshift stage for a miracle play. The villagers working there greeted Father Reynard warmly and Corbett recognised that they admired, even loved, their priest. The clerk stared around the simple church which was freshly decorated. An artist was finishing a vigorous painting of the Angel in the Apocalypse coming from the rising sun. Some of the pews were new and both the chancery screen and the choir loft had been refurbished. Corbett waited until Father Reynard had finished his business with the villagers. ‘You admire our church, Clerk?’ he asked proudly. ‘Yes, a great deal of work has been done. You must have a generous benefactor.’ The priest looked away. ‘God has been good,’ he murmured. ‘And works in mysterious ways.’ ‘Except for the two unfortunates buried in your churchyard.’ The friar narrowed his eyes. ‘What do you mean?’ ‘About eighteen months ago,’ Corbett replied, ‘two corpses were found — a young man and woman, strangers. They were discovered in the woods completely stripped of all clothing and possessions.’ ‘Ah, yes.’ Father Reynard gazed at a point above Corbett's head. ‘That's right,’ he murmured. ‘They are buried in paupers’ graves beneath the old elm tree in the corner of the churchyard. Why do you ask?’ ‘No reason. I wondered if you knew anything about them?’ ‘If I did, I would have told the King's Justices, but nothing was ever discovered about them or their dreadful deaths.’ Father Reynard turned away to speak to one of his villagers as Dame Agatha and Ranulf came through the church door. Ranulf's face was flushed and Corbett surmised he had been sampling some of the tavern's heady ale. He glowered at his servant but Ranulf grinned back as he swayed slightly on his feet and looked around, admiring the church. Dame Agatha took Father Reynard by the sleeve and they walked away, the young sister apologising loudly for being late and asking if Father would give her the altar breads as she must return to the priory. Corbett marched Ranulf out into the porch. ‘A good day's drinking, Ranulf?’ He slyly tapped the side of his nose. ‘I have been renewing my acquaintance with the wench at The Bull. I have learnt a lot, Master, and not just in the carnal sense.’ He licked his lips. ‘Nothing is what it appears to be around here.’ ‘I have gathered that,’ Corbett replied drily. ‘What do you know?’ Ranulf was about to reply when Dame Agatha suddenly emerged, carrying a small wooden box of altar breads, so they went across the green to reclaim their horses. The autumn sun was beginning to set. The villagers, tired now, were bringing their festivities to an end and streaming back across the green to the tavern or to their homes in search of other pleasures. Corbett allowed Ranulf to slouch sleepily in the saddle and waited for Dame Agatha to draw alongside him. ‘I understand Lady Eleanor's funeral is tomorrow?’ The young nun stared soulfully at him, making Corbett catch his breath. Apart from Maeve's, he had never seen such a beautiful face. The autumn sunlight seemed to lend it a glow; her eyes were larger, darker, the half-open lips full and sweet as honey. He coughed and cleared his throat. ‘A sad day for you.’ ‘Yes.’ She smiled wanly. ‘A sad day for me and for the community.’ Corbett looked over his shoulder. Ranulf was now fast asleep and the clerk breathed a prayer that his servant would not fall out of the saddle and break his neck. He also hoped Dame Agatha would shed some light on the murder at Godstowe. ‘Do you blame yourself?’ he began softly. ‘For leaving Lady Eleanor like that? I mean,’ he stammered, ‘when I asked about the funeral, you looked shocked and grieved. It's such a mystery,’ he continued hurriedly. ‘I believe Lady Eleanor liked you?’ Dame Agatha nodded. ‘Yet that day she dismissed you. Was she so melancholic?’ Dame Agatha gathered her reins, pushing her mount closer to Corbett. ‘Everyone says that,’ she whispered ‘You know the Lady Prioress was lying when you talked to her on your first day at Godstowe?’ ‘Yes, I gathered that from your face.’ Dame Agatha smiled to herself. ‘Yes, the Lady Prioress is a bad liar. I mean, would a melancholic woman order everyone to leave her? I tell you this, Master Corbett, in the weeks prior to her death, Lady Eleanor's humour had improved. She was happy, more alert. If she had been really melancholic, I would never have left her alone.’ ‘What caused this change, do you think?’ Dame Agatha laughed mockingly. ‘I don't know. Sometimes I think she had a secret lover.’ ‘What makes you think that?’ Dame Agatha chewed her lip, carefully measuring her words. ‘A week before her death,’ she began slowly, ‘she wrote one of her rare letters to the Prince. A short one. I glimpsed what she had written — nothing extraordinary except that she hoped she would soon find deliverance from her troubles. I think Lady Eleanor was nursing some secret but she would tell no one.’ ‘Do you think she had a lover?’ Corbett persisted. ‘I mean, apart from the Prince?’ ‘Perhaps. But I would not say that in public. The Prince  is a dangerous man. I wouldn't want to be the one responsible for proclaiming him a cuckold for the world to laugh at.’ ‘On that Sunday evening,’ Corbett asked, ‘do you think Lady Eleanor was waiting for this lover? She was seen walking near the church. Perhaps she had a secret assignation?’ Dame Agatha looked at him archly and Corbett panicked. Was the nun going to refuse to answer? ‘You swear to tell no one?’ she asked. Corbett held one hand high. ‘I swear!’ ‘I believe,’ Dame Agatha said in a hushed whisper as if eavesdroppers lurked in the very trees, ‘that Lady Eleanor was preparing to flee Godstowe Priory.’ ‘What makes you say that?’ ‘She was receiving messages. There's a hollow oak tree behind the church. Lady Eleanor took me into her confidence and told me how every day, late in the evening, she went down there to see if another letter had been left.’ ‘How often did these messages come?’ ‘In the month before she died, about two or three arrived. They were delivered in a small leather pouch.’ ‘You were never curious and opened them?’ ‘No, the pouch was sealed and the Lady Eleanor would soon have realised if I'd tampered with it. But I do know the messages pleased her. She became happier, more settled. On one or two occasions she even hinted she would be leaving.’ ‘But who would send her messages?’ The young nun shrugged. ‘I don't know, but on the night she died the Lady Prioress asked me to help take the corpse back to her own  chamber. It was dark and in our haste we only lit one candle. I helped her a rearrange the Lady Eleanor's body on the bed, drawing the curtains around it. Only then did I notice, lying in the far corner, two sets of packed saddle bags full of clothes and small caskets of personal jewellery. I later unpacked these. I've told no one until today.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘Would you be the person responsible for insinuating that Lady Belmont was preparing to flee Godstowe and the Prince? You see,’ Dame Agatha continued excitedly, ‘I believe that Lady Eleanor, in her haste to leave, stumbled on the stairs and fell to her death.’ Corbett shook his head. ‘But she left her chamber without her saddle bags?’ he asked, not revealing that the Lady Prioress had already refuted any allegation that Lady Eleanor had fallen downstairs. Dame Agatha pursed her lips. ‘I cannot answer that.’ ‘You discovered nothing else?’ Dame Agatha smiled and shook her head. ‘And the old sister, the one who drowned in her own tub of water? Do you know what she meant by ‘Sinistra non dextra’?’ ‘Right not left,’ Dame Agatha murmured. ‘No, I do not.’ ‘How long were you Lady Eleanor's companion?’ ‘My name is Savigny,’ the nun replied. ‘I was born of a Gascon father and an English mother in the town of Béarn near the village of Bordeaux. I was left an orphan at an early age and became a ward of court. I expressed a desire to enter the religious life and decided to come to England.’ She narrowed her eyes. ‘That was about eighteen months ago. Lady Eleanor was already at Godstowe. I began to talk  to her, and she asked the Lady Prioress if I could become her companion.’ Corbett settled his horse as it fidgeted nervously at the rustling of some animal in the undergrowth at the side of the track. Both he and Dame Agatha laughed as the commotion roused Ranulf, who woke with a muttered oath, smacking his lips, apparently quite refreshed after his short slumber. He brought his horse alongside theirs as they rounded the corner and the dark green spire of Godstowe Priory came into sight. Corbett fell silent as Ranulf began his bantering teasing of Dame Agatha. Once inside the Galilee Gate Corbett bade the nun goodnight, asking Ranulf to take the horses round to the stables. He watched his manservant lead the horses off, still continuing his good-natured teasing, innocently asking the nun if she had heard the story about the naughty friar of Ludlow. Corbett shook his head and went back to the house. He asked the Guest Mistress if any letters had arrived for him. ‘Oh, no,’ she cried. ‘Lettuce? This year's crop has not been good.’ Corbett groaned and went up to his chamber, throwing himself down on the small cot and reflecting on what he had learnt. First, Father Reynard had secretly admired Lady Eleanor and had been near the Galilee Gate the night she had died. Secondly, Lady Eleanor had been murdered in her own chamber on the night she intended to flee to a secret lover or friend. But who was this? Corbett let his mind drift, feeling guilty because when he thought about Maeve he also kept remembering Dame Agatha's angelic face. He got up and went back down the stairs, going out into the gathering darkness, across the priory grounds behind  the chapel from where he could hear the sweet, melodious chant of the nuns as they sang the first psalm of Compline. The old ruined oak tree beckoned him like some great finger thrust up from the green grass. He went and inspected the cavernous interior carefully. There was nothing except a handful of dried leaves and mildewed wood. ‘Whoever brought the message must have come across the wall,’ Corbett murmured to himself. He measured out thirty paces and stared up at the crenellated boundary wall which was about twenty feet high. The mysterious messenger, Corbett surmised, must have been a very nimble young man to scale that, leave a message and depart. There was no other way in except to walk through the priory, but a stranger would be stopped by the porter and seen by any of the community, be it nun or one of the lay workers. Corbett rubbed his face. There was something wrong but he was too tired to reach any conclusion so he went back to his chamber where Ranulf, a fresh cup of wine in his hand, was waiting for him. ‘The horses are stabled, and Dame Agatha safely returned to the bosom of her community?’ Ranulf grinned. ‘And what did you learn in the village?’ ‘Well,’ Ranulf answered, scratching his head, ‘as I have said, nothing is what it appears to be. Father Reynard may be a fierce preacher but he is a source of spiritual and material comforts to his parishioners.’ ‘What do you mean?’ ‘Well, he not only refuses his tithes but seems to have a source of wealth which enables him to distribute alms, to mend the church as well as have it painted and refurbished.’ ‘And no obvious benefactor?’ Ranulf shook his head. ‘What else?’ ‘The tavern wench says she saw the young man and woman who were later found murdered in the forest. She glimpsed them as they passed the tavern. They were taking the road to Godstowe.’ ‘And were never seen alive again?’ Corbett asked. ‘The tavern wench also believes the landlord of The Bull is a poacher.’ ‘So?’ Ranulf grinned. ‘She says he met someone from the convent on the night that Lady Eleanor died, and that Father Reynard did go to Godstowe but then disappeared until the next morning.’ Corbett leaned back against the bolster and stared up at the ceiling. ‘One person we haven't questioned,’ he said, ‘is our drunken porter. Perhaps he could shed further light on our mystery?’ He looked across at Ranulf. ‘Do you wish to carouse late tonight?’ Ranulf nodded, put the wine cup down, took his cloak and went downstairs. He breathed a sigh of relief as he heard Corbett begin to play gently on the lute he always carried, a sign his master was content, reflecting on his own secret thoughts and not keeping a wary eye on him. Ranulf, too, was content. The tavern wench seemed a promising young lady and he was making a tidy pile of silver out of selling his exotic cures to the villagers and visitors to The Bull. Outside it had turned dark and rather cold as Ranulf trotted along, following the curtain wall to the porter's lodge near the gate. He tapped gently on the door which was pulled open by Red Nose. Ranulf peeped over his shoulder. Inside the two guards of the Prince's retinue sat  at a table, much the worse for drink. Ranulf saw the dice and smiled. ‘Good evening, sirs!’ he cried. ‘I am bored and cannot sleep.’ He jingled the coins in his purse. ‘I'd pay for a cup of wine and I have dice, though I would love to know the finer points of the game!’ Both the porter and the guards welcomed him like a long-lost brother. Ranulf slumped on to the bench and pushed across a silver piece. ‘My donation for the wine.’ He smiled. ‘And here are my dice. I bought them in London but my master…’ His voice trailed off as his hosts rushed to reassure him. So Ranulf's ‘education’ began. He acted the fool, losing at first to whet their appetites, but in an hour emptied his three victims' purses. The guards were so drunk they hardly realised they had been outcheated and slunk off to their pallet beds. The porter, however, had a harder head and Ranulf did not like the suspicious look in bis bleary eyes. ‘Look, man,’ he said, ‘I'll divide with you on this. It's only fair. I had beginner's luck!’ The porter stretched out his hand. ‘Not now! A little information about the Lady Eleanor's death first.’ The porter drew back his hand and rubbed his mouth with the back of his wrist. Ranulf refilled their cups. Outside a wind had sprung up, gently moaning through the trees, carrying the distant shrieks of the night creatures from the dark forest beyond the walls. The thatched roof of the lodge creaked as if mourning over the dreadful secrets of the priory. Ranulf let his own eyes droop. He sighed, rose, and began to scoop his winnings into a small leather purse. ‘Wait!’ The porter staggered drunkenly to his feet. ‘I  will tell you my secret. You must come with me!’ Ranulf agreed and, with the inebriated porter on one hand and a lantern horn in the other, went out into the darkness. The door slammed behind them like a thunder clap. Ranulf looked up and groaned. It was obvious a storm was coming in. The clouds were beginning to gather, hiding the hunter's moon, and Ranulf shivered as he heard an owl hoot and the ominous chatter of other night birds. The wind blew in a low hum, making the trees shift and rustle eerily as if there were shadows waiting in the darkness. Ranulf pulled his cloak tighter, stopped, and looked back at Godstowe Priory, a huge pile of masonry dark against the sky. No lights burned now. He let the fresh air clear the wine fumes from his head and, dropping all pretence, began to question the porter on what he had hinted earlier. The fellow fenced for a while but Ranulf persisted. Eventually the porter broke away from him. ‘I'm going to tell you,’ he slurred drunkenly. Ranulf allowed the fellow to walk ahead of him, round the priory to the Galilee Gate. For a while the man stood muttering and cursing as he clanked his heavy ring of keys, but at last he found the right one and they stepped on to the moonlit track which ran down like a strip of silver through the overhanging trees. They walked along until suddenly the porter turned, following a track into the thick, dark wood. A lonely place, though the porter caused some light comedy with his staggering and drunken curses, stopping every so often to wave Ranulf on, urging him to hold the lantern horn higher. They must have walked for at least three miles and eventually came out of the wood and on to a pathway which led to a crossroads. Ranulf lifted the lantern horn and his blood ran cold as he glimpsed a gibbet standing there. On it a body, half-decayed, still turned and twisted in its iron jacket. The porter gestured him over. ‘You want to know my secrets?’ he slurred. ‘Yes,’ Ranulf hissed. ‘Then swear you will keep them.’ Ranulf raised his right hand. ‘No,’ the porter growled. ‘Here!’ He took Ranulf's hand, led him over to the gibbet and pushed his hand between the iron bars until the tips of his fingers touched the decaying flesh of the hanged man, just above where his heart had been. Ranulf felt his stomach lurch as all the wine he had drunk threatened to spew out. The porter, staggering beside him, made the iron gibbet creak and groan until it appeared that all three were partners in a deadly dance. Ranulf was sworn to secrecy, but there was worse to come. The porter pulled out his knife, slashed the corpse, and then gave Ranulf's arm a small nick on the wrist. He then forced Ranulf's hand close to that of the corpse. Ranulf felt the wet scaliness against his skin as if some dreadful snake was slithering along his arm. Oblivious to the words he spoke, cursing Corbett and near fainting with terror, he swore he would never divulge the secret in this life or the next. Once the macabre masque was over, Ranulf stepped back. His usual good humour had vanished and his hand dropped to the dagger pushed in his belt. The porter stood swaying drunkenly before him. ‘Listen, man!’ Ranulf snapped. ‘I have sworn the oath — now what is it you wish to tell me? What is so dreadful and so secret about the Lady Eleanor's death?’ ‘I didn't say Lady Eleanor!’ he chanted. ‘I didn't say Lady Eleanor! I said my secret. You promised to take the oath and divide your winnings with me for a secret!’ He stood still, his drunken face sagging as Ranulf's dagger  pricked him under the chin. ‘Now, now,’ he slurred. ‘The secret, you bastard!’ The porter fell to his knees and began to scrabble at the soft soil next to the wooden scaffold pole. Rocks and loose dirt were pulled away and eventually he dragged out a tattered leather bag. ‘That's my secret!’ Ranulf knelt beside him, cut open the neck of the bag and shook out the contents into the small pool of lantern light. Nothing much. A collection of thin yellowing bones and a small leather collar. ‘What is this?’ Ranulf muttered. ‘Well, you've heard about the murder?’ the porter replied. ‘The young man and woman whose naked bodies were found in the marsh? A week afterwards, I was out poaching very near the place and I found the body of a small lap dog. The poor creature had died, probably from neglect, or else pined away for its mistress. Only a lady would have a lap dog. There was no one in the village who would own such a pet and the Lady Prioress is quite strict with her community on that, so I knew it must belong to the young woman who had been murdered.’ The fellow grinned, his yellow stumps of teeth shining garishly in the poor light. He pointed to the tattered piece of leather. ‘That's the only thing which gave any clue about her.’ ‘Why didn't you hand it to the Sheriff or the Justices?’ ‘Because there was a gold clasp on it,’ the fellow muttered. ‘I sold it to a tinker. So I thought I'd better bury the poor thing.’ He glimpsed the look of anger in Ranulf's eyes. ‘Take the collar!’ he urged. ‘There's a motto inscribed inside. Examine it carefully. Now, that's my secret,’ he  whined. ‘I know nothing about Lady Eleanor. I was drunk as a bishop the night she died. The Lady Prioress had to sober me up to send me to Woodstock. God knows how I got there. I gave the message to some chamberlain and staggered back.’ ‘You went by horse?’ ‘No, there's a quicker route across the fields. In daylight it's quite clear. Go out the other side of the priory, beyond the farm. You will see the track. It's not an hour's walk.’ Ranulf sighed, pocketed the leather strap, waited for the porter to re-bury the bones and half-carried him back to the priory, listening to the fellow's litany of self-congratulation. ‘Nobody would ever think,’ he slurred, ‘of looking beneath a gibbet!’ Ranulf humoured him and, once they were through the Galilee Gate, handed over the promised coins and went back to the guest house. Corbett was still up, seated on the floor, pieces of parchment strewn around him. Ranulf knew his master had been scribbling his own memoranda, trying to make sense of the mystery which confronted them. Ranulf gave a brief account of what had happened. Corbett grunted, impatiently hurrying him on, and seized the tattered leather strap. He asked Ranulf to hold up a candle and carefully examined the inscription on the faded, leather collar: ‘Noli me tangere’. Do not touch me. ‘What do you think, Ranulf–’ ‘A family motto?’ ‘Perhaps.’ Corbett rubbed the strap between his fingers and went to stare out of the window, half-listening to the sounds of the night outside. In his heart Corbett knew that the murder of  Lady Eleanor and the dreadful silent slaying of that mysterious young woman and her male companion in the nearby woods were inextricably linked. The dungeons of the Louvre Palace were the antechambers of hell though very few of those who went down the dark stony steps ever emerged to recount their experiences. Philip IV's master torturers, a motley gang of Italians and strange, wild creatures from Wallachia, were expert in breaking the bodies and souls of their prisoners. Eudo Tailler, however, had proved to be one of their strongest victims. Despite the crossbow bolt in his thigh, Eudo had survived the rack, the boot and the strappado: every limb was broken but he clung tenaciously to life. He had seen the young French clerk whom Celeste had seduced, be broken in a matter of days and confess to whatever question had been put to him. Eudo was different. He was not frightened for he hated the French more than he feared death. Fifteen years earlier Philip's troops had attacked his father's village and razed it to the ground, wiping out in one night Eudo's brothers and sisters, as well as his young wife and child. Eudo refused to say anything. Oh, he had told lies and they had trapped him by asking for the names of other English agents in Paris. He had told them many a fairy story and when they checked, they returned more furious than before, dragging him out of his dirty, fetid pit back into the great vaulted torture chamber to be questioned once again. Sometimes Eudo had glimpsed the French King, his blond hair glinting in the guttering torchlight. Philip would stand behind the black-masked torturers waiting for Eudo to speak. Now it was all over. Eudo knew he was going to die. He had also realised what the French wanted from him: the truth about the Prince of Wales' former mistress, now immured at Godstowe. What had Corbett told him about her? they asked. Had she been married to the Prince? Were any of the nuns royal agents? Did the name de Courcy mean anything to them? Eudo had replied through swollen, bloody lips that he knew nothing, so the questioners changed tack. Who was the de Montfort assassin now stalking Edward of England? Was he at Godstowe or in London? He could not have told them. All he knew was a conversation heard second-hand at a hostelry in Bordeaux, although Eudo, a Gascon, had a shrewd idea of the true identity of the assassin. Now, on this last day of his life, he showed he could stand the pain no more. The torturers had chained him to a wall, applying searing hot pokers to the softest and most tender parts of his body. Eudo opened his bloodied lips in a soundless scream. ‘The assassin, Master Tailler?’ Eudo shook his head. Again the hot searing pain. ‘The assassin, Master Eudo? Give us his name, then you can sleep.’ Eudo felt his life seeping from him. He felt detached, as if he was floating high up above them and the executioners were only playing with the useless bundle of flesh that had once been his body. He began softly to mutter the final act of contrition to himself. Surely God would remember he had been loyal to his king? The torturers were waved back by a senior clerk who had accompanied the French King to the dungeon. He hid his distaste as he pressed his ear up against the dying man's lips. ‘What did you say, Monsieur Tailler? The name of the assassin?’ Eudo summoned all his strength, as if he could stand the pain no longer, and whispered a name. The clerk stood  back, smiling triumphantly over his shoulder at his royal master. ‘He has told us, Your Grace. We have our man.’ Philip remained impassive. ‘Ask him again!’ he snapped. The clerk moved forward, took one look at Eudo and hastily stepped back. ‘He is dead, Your Grace.’ Philip nodded. ‘Cut him down!’ he ordered. He turned to the clerk. ‘Send the following despatch in cipher to Seigneur de Craon. He must have it as soon as possible.’"
FIC FIC-H85-007 -0.16 "Chapter Nine While the ladies were fuelling their fire, in more ways than one, John Coffin was taking a walk. It was the end of his working day, and although not exactly free of preoccupation (he would be telephoning Paul Lane the moment he got in), he wanted some time to himself. He was wearing the unobtrusive shabby clothes with soft shoes that would allow him to plod round the streets without being noticed. He liked to do this occasionally, acting as an anonymous, unobserved pair of eyes and ears. He was saving Mrs Brocklebank for tomorrow. As she advanced with the vacuum cleaner she had forced him to buy, with her duster over her arm, and her customary air of efficiency, he would say: ‘Wait a minute, Rhoda.’ Now he knew she was called Rhoda, he could make a brave start. Before, she had slightly intimidated him. Men have always been respectful of Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, easily intimidated by the mysteries she manipulates so easily. John Coffin was no exception; a clever and practical man, he was unable to manage his own electric oven. It was new and the knobs were different, the old one he had known his way about. The refrigerator was easy, you just opened the door and put food in it until it looked like an igloo inside, and then a pair of hands which might or might not be your own came along and cleared out the ice  so that you could use it again. On such simple lines he conducted his life. It was one of the ways he showed his generation. All the young ones like Topper and Evans learned to cook at their mother's knee. Or their first live-in girlfriend taught them quickly. Now the capable Mrs Brocklebank had become someone who had a conscience and a guilty secret. She had told him half of her worry, but the other half she had kept to herself. She was just a subject to be questioned. Today his walk did not hold his attention as it usually did. The streets were hot, the pavements sticky. No one was about except a black and white cat asleep in the sun. In the distance, through an open window, he could hear pop music pounding away, not the tune, if there was one, just the beat. He turned into the main road that ran parallel with the unseen river. The district had changed since he last lived here, but he was not so old that he resented it. Change had to come, or we should all still be living in caves. Besides, in some ways the change was for the better. In particular, Greenwich Wick was becoming a new world. Lurching into it, with one part lumbered with unlovely council tower blocks up the hill, while nearer the river the developers had arrived, and where once had been a network of tiny streets harbouring some of the most professional criminal families in South London, there were now several expensive blocks of flats: expensive because they faced the river and looked sideways to the old Royal Palace of Greenwich with the trees and slopes of the park  behind. Coffin wondered if the inhabitants of Drake Towers, with their BMWs and Porsches, knew that the old Francis Drake Street had been a regular thieves' kitchen. Policemen had walked in pairs there in the old days. The joke was, as he knew from the records, that one of two of the most successful criminous families had moved from council flats into the new apartments on the proceeds of a life of profitable wrongdoing. Billy Egan and Terry Place had not quite risen to their ranks, although Egan at least had aspired to. For a moment he found himself thinking of Letty. He had tried to telephone her twice and got no reply, not even an answering machine delivering a placatory little message. He began to suspect that she had gone to Glasgow. In which case he might even now have a new brother or sister. He wasn't sure he really wanted this, which was perhaps why he had not done much about it himself. He had Letty and now found himself dreading a new face to love. He swung round and began to walk back to Church Row. He was not reading the district well this evening, he might as well give up and go home. He felt alien, not necessarily a bad thing in itself for an observer. A sense of detachment might produce a sharper view, but he felt unreal, as if the scene he was viewing was nothing more than a backdrop at a theatre which might roll itself up and disappear when the present act was over. It was fatigue, of course; that special feeling of unreality was nearly always due to weariness. From out of the past came a memory of a quick cut home, down past the side of Deller's and then out  into Queen Charlotte's Alley. Not a recognized route, it had been a track much used and he was willing to bet it was still there. An air of antiquity hung over that pathway, which, followed to its logical end, ran down to the river, as if the ancient Britons had used it first and it would go on being used even after the Bomb fell. He found the path easily, broken at one or two points by the new arrangements at Deller's, a shed here, a car parked there, but both easily circumvented. He was walking into Queen Charlotte's Alley before he recognized where he was. Coming at it, at this angle on this hot evening, he saw the change vividly. Now it was smart. In the old days, it had been just poor. After all, he had not come here by accident. Give his unconscious mind a chance and it usually showed his feet which way to go. He wanted to see Sarah Fleming. He wanted to see both the Flemings. They were the bridge between the two crimes. Not Terry Place, who, as far as could be judged, had never met any of the Pitts except the girl, and that on a day that nearly killed him. Not Rhoda Brocklebank, even though she knew everybody, and was certainly more deeply linked with William Egan than she had admitted; not her because she was not emotionally involved with the Pitts. They were her employers, that was all. She had no insight to offer him. But the Flemings, yes, because Peter had certainly loved Nona. He knew Sarah was at home, since he could see her watering the plants in her small garden. She was doing it with her usual spare, economical elegance, but also with the air of one who would rather be doing something else. ‘You're not enjoying this,’ he said, taking the heavy can off her, and starting the watering himself. ‘They are Weenie's plants, she put them in, the social worker said it would be good for her to have something to look after, give her a sense of responsibility, but she doesn't do it.’ ‘Perhaps she'd do better with a cat or a dog.’ ‘One couldn't trust an animal to Weenie.’ ‘She'll grow up one day.’ ‘Oh yes, I expect she will, there's quite a lot of growing inside Weenie. I don't know about the boys, though.’ For a long time he had wondered about the history of this little family, now it looked as though he was going to find out. ‘Weenie was with my mother and father when they were killed, the boys weren't. Weenie would be normal enough, I think, if it weren't for that. She was all right before. What happened then seemed to…stunt her. Every way, physically and mentally. I don't think the boys ever did have far to go, but Weenie did have.’ Her tone was sad. ‘What happened?’ He had heard some talk about an accident. People didn't seem to care to talk about it much. ‘You don't know? Most people round here know. It's a kind of fable. Or a joke. Only they don't joke  much about death. And they're sorry for us. They are kind round here, never think they are not.’ Coffin nodded, telling himself he might remember this fact when people talked to him about ‘neighbourhood’ crimes. Only perhaps your face had to fit to get the kindness, you had to belong. The Flemings undoubtedly belonged. ‘Dad was driving the van. He hired it out. That was how he made a living after he lost his job on the railway, through drink and petty pilfering. I don't usually tell people that, although I expect you know already. He was quite clever, Dad, in his way, but he had never had an education. I don't think he wanted it, he liked the way he was. Mum married beneath her, as they say, she had an education, only it never took, she wasn't bright. I used to wonder why she married Dad, but I know really. It's easy. What they had in common was what a lot of people have.’ She stopped, and then went on: ‘Anyway, he had Mum in the van with him and Weenie, but the rest of us were at home. I was at school. He had a vanload of manure. And he hit a lorry full of pigs going to the abattoir at Woolwich.’ ‘Don't go on if you don't want to,’ said Coffin. ‘Dad hit the lorry, smashed right into it. And all the pigs came tumbling out. They found Dad in the middle of the road with a pig straddling him and manure all over his face. He was dead. So was the pig, for that matter. The rest of them were running round squealing. Weenie was all right, but Mum had a ruptured spleen and died before they could get her to hospital.’ ‘How long ago was this?’ ‘Nearly three years. I took over the family. Now you know why we are the way we are. You must have been wondering.’ Coffin thought she was gallant and brave and loving, when caring for Weenie and her brothers could not have come easily. Sarah put the trowel she had been using carefully into her garden basket and removed her garden gloves. ‘Why did you come tonight? Is it about your laundry? I know I've been slow lately. But there have been reasons.’ ‘I understand that, Sarah,’ he said gently. ‘And no, it's not about my laundry.’ He picked up her basket. ‘Shall we go into the house?’ She stood still. ‘I know we must look a kind of circus. ‘Now, now.’ She allowed herself a small smile. ‘Come on in, then, I'm going to make some coffee. Have a cup with me. The coffee proved to be filtered and freshly ground, something he had not expected. She saw his expression and read it accurately. ‘You expected coffee powder and boiling water, didn't you? Well, so it is most of the time. But this is my little luxury that I have when I can. When it seems the right time.’ He was pleased that this was the right time. He felt a warm liking for the pretty, brave girl. It might be a dangerous feeling, but he would see it was dangerous only to him and not to the girl. They drank the coffee in the kitchen. No small talk, but a friendly silence. ‘So why did you come?’ Sarah put down her cup. ‘Where is your brother?’ ‘Out walking. He mostly is, these days.’ There was sympathy and toleration in her voice. ‘He loved Nona?’ She nodded. ‘What sort of a girl was she? How did you feel about her?’ ‘You mean, was she the sort of girl that other girls could be friends with? Yes, she was. Even a girl like me that would have liked some of the things she had. She was effortless, was Nona. Grown-up for her age, a bit wild. I envied her.’ ‘You don't need to.’ ‘I've always had to fight. I don't mind the fight. In a way I enjoy it. But just sometimes… ’ She shrugged. ‘Well, poor kid, she's gone and I'm sorry. She didn't deserve that, none of them did.’ ‘Can you think of any reason why she should have been killed? Anyone who disliked her?’ Sarah shook her head silently. In a way, she had come close to hating Nona at times, although she was not going to admit it. But not to kill. Not like that. ‘What about the rest of the family?’ She looked surprised. ‘They were nice. Charming. I admired Irene. Didn't know Mr Pitt, but he was always polite.’ ‘Did everyone like them?’ She was silent again. ‘Let me put that another way. Were they disliked as a family?’ She shook her head. ‘No. They were nice people.’ Not exactly what I heard, thought Coffin. ‘You never saw any signs of jealousy or resentment of them?’ Sarah occupied herself taking the coffee cups over to the sink. ‘I know what you mean,’ she said. ‘But no, I never saw anything like that.’ ‘They were a lot richer than most people round here and had more status. Isn't that true?’ ‘Yes, yes and yes,’ said Sarah, ‘but I never saw any signs of hatred. There, have I answered you?’ ‘Yes. I think you have.’ Coffin got up and stood looking out of the window. He could see a tiny backyard with a scrap of lawn and a few flowers. Clothes were pegged out on a line, nothing of his own. ‘I would like to see your brother.’ ‘He'll be in. Or he won't be.’ Another shrug. ‘He recovered after that business down by the river? It was hard on him and the girl.’ ‘It was rotten for them. He was so brave and good then. He saved Nona's life.’ Her voice was defiant. Coffin said in a careful voice: ‘Yes, but I find that the whole episode is puzzling. He knew Terry Place, didn't he?’ Sarah nodded, reluctantly, he felt, as if she would have denied it if she could. ‘They both loved the Cutty Sark, and the river. I don't think Place can have been all bad, even if he did kill someone.’ ‘Friends, would you call them?’ He was probing her. She knew something. ‘Friends? That's a hard word. Only in a kind of way. They were people who had things in common.’ She was phrasing it carefully, as if she was writing an essay. It alerted Coffin. ‘Did he go there that day to meet Place? I have wondered. Coincidence worries me.’ ‘You'd have to ask him yourself.’ ‘And what do you think?’ Sarah hesitated. Then she took a deep breath. In the end you had to trust someone and she trusted this man. ‘I'm not saying he knew Place would be there, but I guess he thought he would be.’ ‘Ah.’ Coffin considered. ‘Then why did he take the girl there?’ ‘He hasn't told me,’ said Sarah carefully. Coffin sat down again on one of the hard kitchen chairs. He would have to speak to the boy again. Get more out of him. ‘He may have wanted to impress her,’ said Sarah. ‘Do something brave. And he did, of course. Or she may have asked to go.’ She dropped this into the conversation as an afterthought, but it interested Coffin. Nona as an active participant in their arrival at the tunnel party was a new idea. ‘I'll have to speak to him myself.’ ‘I don't think anyone can talk to him at the moment. I know I can't. He doesn't seem to hear. The doctor says it's shock. Because of Nona's death on top of the other thing.’ ‘Is there anything else to tell me about Terry Place and your brother?’ He had the feeling there was something more. It was in her eyes and the fidgety movement of the hands. After a moment of silence in which she studied his face, she said: ‘I don't know if it's of any importance, but they played a game.’ ‘A game?’ A fantastic picture of Terry Place with a tennis racket came to him. No, that was wrong. ‘Bingo?’ ‘Not likely.’ Sarah gave a small smile. ‘A mind game.’ ‘Like chess?’ Even in fantasy he could not see Terry Place settling down to a game of chess. Although he could have learnt in prison. ‘More like Snakes and Ladders.’ ‘Where did they play? Did they meet here?’ ‘I don't think they did meet. Or not much. Anyway, not here.’ She was beginning to look harassed. Leave the game, he told himself. Come back to it later. For the moment he left the subject there, and went back to another line of questioning. ‘You say you did not know Nona Pitt well. I accept that. But you were the same age, you might have known or heard things about her that adults would not know.’ Sarah returned his gaze without much expression. He was coming to realize that she could hold her own under fire. Slowly she shook her head. ‘Can't think of anything. We weren't at school together or anything like that.’ ‘But she was friendly with your brother even then.’ ‘Oh yes. Sure.’ The ready, noncommittal agreement of her generation. ‘Close? They were close?’ ‘Yes.’ Now she smiled. ‘Pete really did go for her then. That's when it began. For him anyway. Of course, she was only a kid. It couldn't be so important for her. She had a lot of growing to do.’ ‘It has been suggested to me that there was some  episode in Nona's life that disturbed her, greatly disturbed her. And that it might have some bearing on what has happened now. I don't know what that episode was. Do you?’ ‘No.’ She was telling the truth, he could tell. ‘The name Kincaid mean anything to you? Malcolm Kincaid.’ She shook her head. ‘No, not a thing. Never heard it.’ ‘He was one of the students who rented the Pitt house in Church Street, they were missing for a while. You never heard that story?’ ‘I seem to remember hearing something,’ she said vaguely. ‘But it didn't register.’ ‘Malcolm Kincaid was later found dead.’ ‘Oh.’ The monosyllable reflected disinterested pity, no more. She might have said as much if a cat had died. ‘What about your brother, would he know anything?’ ‘Is this in connection with Nona?’ ‘Yes, it is.’ ‘Then he might.’ She corrected herself. ‘Well, they were close.’ She gave a little shake of her head. ‘But if there was anything, then he never told me.’ ‘Might he have been involved? In whatever there was?’ Now she was wary. ‘Peter never did anything wrong,’ she said swiftly. ‘I never said so.’ ‘Right.’ She subsided. ‘So you can't help me?’ ‘No. I never heard of anything. Nona always looked all right to me.’ She did not like the subject, he could see that. All the more reason to talk to Peter Fleming when he could. He recognized a time to change tack. ‘Any more coffee in the pot?’ Sarah shook it. ‘A cup each.’ She had to put water in it to stretch it, but it was still a decent cup of coffee by his standards. Not by hers, though, he thought, watching her face as she drank. A sudden wave of feeling for the clever, perfectionist girl washed over him. ‘Your family are lucky to have you,’ he heard himself say suddenly. There was a pause while she thought about it. ‘I hope they think so. Haven't you got any family?’ ‘A half-sister. Perhaps more than one.’ ‘Don't you know?’ she said, laughing. Her face was pretty and animated, even though her hair was untidy and her lipstick chewed. He suspected she was glad to be changing the subject away from the Fleming family and on to his. But he felt her warmth and friendliness, her sheer vitality reached out to move him. He began to tell her about Letty and then about the astonishing story that there might be another member of the family tucked away in Scotland. ‘In Glasgow, of all places.’ He shook his head. For such a Londoner, the idea seemed impossible. How could a member of his family have got there? By being born there, Letty had said. ‘You ought to go and look.’ ‘I think my sister has. At least she's dropped out of touch and I suspect that's where she is.’ The coffee was beginning to sit strangely on him, she had been wise to leave hers more or less untouched. ‘I don't know why I am telling you all this.’ ‘Because you're a nice man. Kind.’ ‘Not sure how you can tell.’ With a smile, she said: ‘When you've washed a man's shirts and underpants, you do know something about him.’ ‘I shouldn't have let you do it.’ ‘It was not for you to say,’ said Sarah proudly. ‘Now I know you better, Sarah, I think I'd pay you not to do it.’ Soon after that, he left. Peter had still not appeared. Out of all his questions asked in the line of the investigation, perhaps he had not got very much, although he was not so sure about that. But there had certainly been something else. He had a lot to think about. As he walked home, he reflected that it was almost a love passage. It was not, of course. Just the way it came out."
FIC FIC-J54-002 -0.03 "SARA'S father, Charles Monroe, had been the son of Aunt Alicia's only sister. His parents had died as prisoners of the Japanese in Singapore, and it had been a further great grief to Alicia Lockwood when her beloved nephew had been killed in the desert in 1942 a few weeks after Sara was born. To escape the raids in London, Charles's wife Peggy had gone to stay with Aunt Alicia in the country, and that was how Sara managed to be born at Moorlake House. She had lived there until the war was over, and then her mother had married again and started a new family. Peggy Monroe was young and her wounds had healed over. Aunt Alicia found solace in the little Sara, as bubbly and zestful as her nephew had been. She had no other great-nieces or nephews and it was accepted that Sara was her darling, that Sara was to get Moorlake  House and what little money and possessions Aunt Alicia had left. Nobody in Sara's family thought it would be a great deal, nobody indeed thought much about it. It was just accepted that one day Sara would have a little inheritance. Sara herself never dwelt on it. She loved her great-aunt for many reasons. She was fun to be with, her eccentricities were amusing rather than irritating, she was kind and she was Sara's contact with the father she had never known. In a way, Aunt Alicia knew her father better than her mother ever had. A swift wartime courtship, a deep passionate love of a few weeks, then marriage, separation and death. Her mother had been with her father so little time. Aunt Alicia had known him all his life. She had tales to tell of him as a small boy, as a young man. She possessed snap-shots and formal photographs. She had his fishing rod still, his old saddle. For Sara, Aunt Alicia's tales of Charles Monroe with his dash and heroism had all the flavour of high romance. It was impossible not to compare  him with her stepfather, so cold, reserved and cautious, and whose passions seemed solely aroused by his business and moneymaking skill. From an early age, Sara had sensed that she irritated him, by her presence, by the fact that she was there to remind him of his wife's earlier marriage. And because she was conscious all the time of his pride in his own daughter Jenny, so much brighter, her diffidence and lack of self-confidence increased. Her mother had died when she most needed help in her development, with all the problems of adolescence. Robert Simpson accepted willingly enough the responsibility for her material welfare. She went to a good school, had enough clothes and pocket money. That was his duty, after all. But her heart and emotions and happiness held little interest for him. After her mother's death, Sara clung to her Great-Aunt Alicia more than ever. She spent all her holidays at Moorlake House. She knew every inch of its twisting rambling passageways, every tree in its old lovely garden. It was a magic place and  the fact that one day it would belong to her lay at the back of her mind like some deep buried treasure. But when it did belong to her, she would be old too, like Aunt Alicia. Moorlake was in the dim future, a beacon possibly, but far away on the horizon. But now with Aunt Alicia's death, Moorlake was here in the present. Sara felt bereft. She was bitterly sad that she had not been able to see her aunt before she died. She wished she had decided to come home a month earlier, even two days earlier. She wished she had written more often to her aunt, and better letters; but then as Jenny had said, she was not very good at writing letters. She felt cheated. It did not seem possible that so lively a person was dead. Age really had nothing to do with her. True, she was old, but Sara had always imagined she would be one of those people who lived to be a hundred and had a telegram from the Queen. Nobody talked about Moorlake House  in the Simpson household until after the funeral. It was uppermost in Sara's mind. She felt as though someone had dumped an enormous casket of jewels in her lap, and pleasurable though that was, she knew that in her heart she would much rather have her great-aunt alive, and the casket of treasure at some much later time in her own life. Moorlake was not uppermost in either Robert or Jenny Simpson's mind. Robert knew that his stepdaughter would have a little inheritance, not as much as it should have been because that stubborn old woman had dipped into her capital to buy worthless stock, but it would be a nice little nest-egg all the same. The house, of course, would have to be sold, although heaven alone knew who would buy an old barn like that these days. Jenny Simpson gave Moorlake hardly a thought. It was nothing to do with her and she could not understand Sara's love of the old house. It would have to be sold, of course, and her mind boggled a little at  the clearing up of the accumulations of a lifetime Sara would have to do. Moorlake to Jenny meant Matthew Preston. She wondered what he would do now, and where he would live. In the meantime, for Sara, as Aunt Alicia's only relative, there were the funeral arrangements to make. Her stepfather took over this task for her. Alicia Lockwood was nothing to him, merely a connection with his wife's first husband. He had seen very little of her and was not at all interested in her. But clearly it would not be right for Sara to have to deal with all the arrangements by herself. Robert Simpson always knew where his duty lay and what was correct and proper. After the funeral, when they were eating the lunch he had arranged at the Black Lion in Wellingham High Street, Sara was approached by Mr. Crowther, Aunt Alicia's solicitor and senior partner in Crowther, Boon and Crowther, who had been solicitors in Wellingham for three generations. He murmured discreetly that he would like a little word with her  privately. They managed their conference over coffee, which they took in the lounge sitting in the chairs by the window.  ""It's about your aunt's will—"" Mr. Crowther began. Sara nodded dumbly at him. She was still distressed and could have wished that Mr. Crowther had waited a little longer before telling her about her inheritance, when the sadness and regret she felt about Aunt Alicia's death was not so overpowering. Aunt Alicia was old, she kept telling herself, and she'd had a full life, and she died in her sleep with no pain, but somehow it did not seem to make it much better. Some ten minutes later, looking paler and feeling more shaken than ever, she rejoined her stepfather.  ""Do you want to go over to Moorlake now?""  Robert Simpson asked her. Sara shook her head violently.  ""I want to go back to London with you,"" she said. ""I've said good-bye to Lizzie. Her niece is spending the night with her, so she should be all right, but she seems a little strange, as though, she hadn't quite caught on that Aunt Alicia has gone."" Only in the car when they were well on their way to London did she inform her stepfather of what Mr. Crowther had told her.  ""Aunt Alicia has changed her will,"" she said flatly, breaking the long silence between them. Startled, her stepfather came out of his reverie.  ""She's what?""   ""She's left me some money and all her furniture and things,"" Sara went on, ""but she's only left me half the house.""  ""Half the house? How could she leave you half the house?""asked Robert Simpson incredulously. ""Who has she left the other half to? Lizzie?"" ""No. Lizzie has her annuity."" Sara paused a moment and then said, ""She's left the other half to Matthew Preston."" "
NWS NWS-A1F-020 -0.16 "Monument to the power of the gun: Andrew Higgins revisits Tiananmen Square for communist China's 40th birthday party By ANDREW HIGGINS At a distance — the only vantage allowed anyone except soldiers and carefully vetted civilians — it could almost be the Goddess of Democracy. Sculpted from white plaster like the students' statue, the new monument has been erected on the spot where the democracy movement's impertinent icon of defiance stood until the People's Liberation Army arrived on 4 June. For the few considered politically reliable enough to get a closer look, there can be no mistake. The 25 ft statue marking the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic of China is an altogether different creature from its smashed predecessor. Far from mimicking the Statue of Liberty, the new statue holds a gun — not just any gun but an AK-47, the weapon used by the army to blast its way into Peking. Its barrel, pointed by a helmeted soldier, is sticking into the chest of a worker in overalls. A peasant stands next to them; behind is a bespectacled intellectual. Tiananmen Square may have been ‘handed back to the people’, according to Peking's mayor, Chen Xitong, but, as the statue makes clear, real power comes not from the people but from the gun. In an unsubtle reminder of the importance of firepower, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders gathered in Tiananmen last night to celebrate the 40th birthday of ‘new China’ with a deafening display of pyrotechnics. For more than an hour, rockets exploded across the sky — an extravaganza that for many Peking residents recalled not so much the glory of the revolution as the tracer bullets and machine-gun fire of early June. If the Goddess of Democracy symbolised a vision of China alien to the Communist Party, the new figures are equally alien to the students: the obedience of the intellectual and unflinching solidarity of the ‘workers, peasants and soldiers’. Ironically, neither of these visions is Chinese. While the students looked to the West, China's hardline leadership has found its inspiration in the pre-glasnost Soviet Union of Stalinist aesthetics -muscular arms, square jaws and stiff poses. The official blurb explains that the plaster figures ‘stand as if boldly forging ahead, their eyes fixed on our motherland's beautiful future’. Perhaps unwittingly, the new statue hints at a deeper truth underpinning the hardline triumph: the worker, the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the Forbidden City, the grandest monument to the genius of Chinese civilisation, but the soldier has his eyes fixed in a different direction — down the Avenue of Eternal Peace towards Zhongnanhai, the walled compound where party leaders live and work. For as Mao decreed, if power grows from the barrel of a gun, it is the party that must control, and if necessary use, that gun. Four months after the People's Liberation Army stormed central Peking with the loss of hundreds of lives, few can have any doubt about the party's determination to enforce this Maoist maxim. As many as 100,000 soldiers are still encamped around Peking. Soldiers stand guard on street corners and roam the city at night. Occasional gunshots can still be heard, though no one seems to know who fires the guns and if anyone is hit. The leaders remain haunted by the forces of dissent they ordered the army to crush. Across China there has been a ritualistic cleansing to erase the symbols of the student movement. Noticeboards have been scrubbed clean of posters, walls of daubed slogans and minds of memories of what really happened. Imitating the students' tactics, the party has ordered shops and houses be strung with banners praising the ‘great and glorious Communist Party of China’. And, again like the students, it has issued an official list of permitted slogans, ordering citizens to memorise 40 different chants to mark the 40th anniversary of communist rule. Not as stirring as the protest movement's shouts of ‘long live democracy, down with autocracy’, they include cumbersome chants hailing ‘the great achievement of socialism’ and ‘warmly hail the victory over the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion’. Nowhere has the leadership struggled to exorcise the memory of the student- led revolt as in Tiananmen itself, the symbolic heart of the nation where, on 1 October 1949, Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the People's Republic of China. The students who occupied the square for three weeks in May and early June have been banished. So, too, has anyone without the special pass needed to get through military cordons. The Monument to the People's Heroes, the stone obelisk in the middle of the square where student leaders had their ‘command centre’, has been declared a forbidden zone because it is felt to have been contaminated by the students' presence. In an attempt at gaiety before the national day, fairy lights were strung on trees where political banners and cartoons lampooning the leaders once hung. There is no doubt now who controls the square. China's leaders have become so fearful of revolt that Tiananmen is guarded round the clock by uniformed soldiers with guns while the rest of Peking remains firmly under martial law. Scores of Tiananmen's paving stones have been replaced to remove the evidence of anti-government messages. Others have been covered with flower pots to hide the traces of the student occupation or scars left by the tracks of tanks and armoured personnel carriers. Try as the leadership might to erase what happened, nothing can be done to change the one fact on which the future of China turns: the men who ordered the assault on Tiananmen Square will surely die long before the youth they ordered to be killed. Deng Xiaoping is 85, and while apparently in reasonably good health, will not outlive the instigators of the ‘counter-revolutionary rebellion’. Other veteran revolutionaries on whose longevity the current leadership depends are all in their eighties. Some, like the hardline godfather Chen Yun, are so infirm they are rarely seen in public. Others do occasionally venture out but are painful to watch. At a state banquet on the eve of the national day in the Great Hall of the People, the head tables were cluttered with ageing revolutionaries slumped in their seats. When Li Peng, the Prime Minister, tried to share a toast with his adoptive mother, the venerable widow of Chou En-lai, he was met with an uncomprehending stare. In desperation, he finally raised not only his own glass but also hers — a graphic reminder of how fragile the veterans', and by association Mr Li's own, power may turn out to be. But if they are physically weak, the old guard remain politically strong. Refighting the battles of their own youth, they have tried to fix China's eyes firmly on the past. The party may claim to be in the vanguard of history, but its clock seems to have stopped in the 1950s. Propaganda campaigns, class struggle, the cult of the model worker and even the almost evangelical rhetoric of the cold war are all back with a vengeance. Television and newspapers no longer praise model entrepreneurs but heroic labourers such as Zhang Fuxin, praised for throwing himself into a pit of polluted mud to retrieve a piece of equipment. People are told that Mr Zhang was so dedicated that he cut short his honeymoon to return to work, telling his new wife: ‘One day without hearing the sound of the drill, my heart is heavy. One day without wearing work clothes, it's as if I lack something. I feel ill at ease.’ In deference to ageing stalwarts, the Communist Party's new leader, Jiang Zemin, recently made a pilgrimage to Yenan, the remote village where the Red Army took refuge at the end of the Long March. The future of China, he pronounced, depends on reviving the ‘Yenan spirit’ of hard work and plain living. So strong is the nostalgia, that Mao, Chou En-lai and other founders of ‘new China’ often seem to have returned from the dead. The front page of the People's Daily and every other major national newspaper last week featured a picture of the new Politburo standing committee meeting with actors from a People's Liberation Army theatre troupe made up to look like the dead founding fathers. Mao lookalikes also dominate the cinema. The country's best known Mao impersonator, an actor called Gu Yue, has made a startling comeback in a new 90-minute epic portraying the last months of China's civil war. In a further nod of respect to the great helmsman, his portrait on the Forbidden City has been given a new look. Already replaced once in June after being splattered with paint, it was replaced again last week with a new painting featuring a bluer sky. In Peking at least, the resurrection of past models and heroes has provoked more giggling than respect, spawning a rash of political jokes. Take for example the peasant who visits the mausoleum housing Mao's corpse in Tiananmen Square. ‘Where is Mao? I want to talk to him,’ he says to the guard at the door. ‘You can't talk to him; he's dead,’ replies the guard. After touring the mausoleum, the peasant returns and again asks where he can find Mao alive. Again the guard replies that he is dead. The peasant then walks past the corpse for a second time and emerges to ask the same question. ‘I told you, he's been dead for years,’ the guard snaps. ‘I know,’ the peasant answers, ‘but I just love to hear you say it.’ Another joke is about a student marching down the Avenue of Eternal Peace with a banner saying ‘Li Peng is a pig’. The student is arrested, tried and sentenced to 20 years. He complains that illegal protests carry a maximum sentence of five years. ‘Yes,’ replies the judge. ‘Five years for an illegal protest and 15 for revealing state secrets.’ Such is the mood of quiet irreverence and anger that street hawkers have begun selling buttons with the two-finger victory sign that became the symbol of the student movement. As an ingenious precaution against charges of ‘counter-revolutionary’ tendencies, the buttons carry a small legend: ‘Victory!— I climbed the Great Wall of China.’"
NWS NWS-A1G-001 -0.03 "Tigrayans advance on a helpless Addis Ababa From RICHARD DOWDEN in Addis Ababa THE ETHIOPIAN army is failing to halt northern rebels advancing rapidly southwards to the capital and its vital lifeline road. Some observers are predicting the imminent collapse of the military regime which has ruled Ethiopia for 15 years. The rebels, the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), are threatening to cut off Dese, a key garrison town protecting part of the road linking Addis Ababa with the port of Assab. They have advanced down the Asmara road in the past four weeks and are now reported to be operating south of Dese. They have surrounded a garrison at Bati, to the east, and on 19 September they attacked Mile on the Assab road, closing it for 36 hours. Helicopter gunships ply constant missions from their base at Kombolcha: yesterday I watched MiG-21 fighter-bombers, loaded with bombs and rockets, take off from Dire Dawa and head west. The estimated 40,000 troops in Dese are being joined by the remnants of the defeated Third Army, which is struggling down the road or surrendering to the rebels. One estimate puts government losses in the past four weeks at 20,000 killed, captured or deserted. The government in Addis Ababa will say nothing about the situation, and the war is not reported by the state-run media. However, recent visitors to Dese describe the areas as chaotic, with whole units leaderless and unwilling to fight. Soviet advisers have been withdrawn from Dese and Kombolcha. A Soviet Deputy Defence Minister, General Varrenikov, has been in Addis Ababa for the past week. He is reported to be negotiating the complete withdrawal of the 1,500 Soviet military advisers. The Russians have said they believe in a negotiated settlement to the civil war, but they are continuing to supply arms to President Mengistu, apparently to allow him to negotiate from a position of strength. A large consignment of weapons was unloaded from a Soviet ship at Assab on 21 September. Weapons will not, however, save President Mengistu if no one is willing to use them. The Ethiopian army, the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa, consists largely of press-ganged young peasants or unemployed urban teenagers who have been drafted to the front after a few weeks' training. At the end of a spectacularly successful year, the TPLF drove the Ethiopian army out of Tigray province in February. Few people thought the Tigrayans could continue their success outside their own province, but on 26 August the TPLF began an advance which drove the government forces out of Korem and Kobo. Three weeks ago, the 102nd Airborne Division, Russian-trained and regarded as a crack unit, was rushed from its base at Asmara to the front line, but it too has been mauled by the rebels, who swept through the mountains flanking the main road, capturing all the towns as far as Woldiya. Meanwhile, in Eritrea, to the north, a de facto ceasefire is holding between the government and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), which is seeking independence for Eritrea. Peace talks began in Atlanta, Georgia, last month and are due to resume in Nairobi on 18 November. The only government-controlled areas in highland Eritrea are the road between Asmara and Massawa and the garrisons of Keren, Senafe and Adi Kwala. Government troops are digging deep defences at Asmara and there is no doubt that, should the peace talks fail, the EPLF will resume fighting and attack it, or try to cut it off. One option for the TPLF is to strike east, to the Assab-Addis Ababa road. If they succeed in cutting it, they will have achieved checkmate. They could strike west and try to cut off Gonder, another heavily-fortified garrison, or they could try to continue rolling south towards the capital. Addis Ababa is guarded by about 20,000 troops, including President Mengistu's Praetorian guard, which saved him during the coup attempt in May. No one believes the TPLF can take the capital, but their continuing success could persuade senior army officers that President Mengistu should be replaced by someone who can stop the war and negotiate. ‘The situation is very, very fluid and there is a possibility that the regime will disintegrate,’ said one Western diplomat. The TPLF has recently transformed itself into the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Movement to give itself more national credibility, but its core remains the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray, whose political model seems closest to the late Enver Hoxha's Albania. Much as many Ethiopians fear and loathe the government, they are calling for more political and economic freedom, and would not feel liberated by the TPLF. Nor would they welcome a takeover by the Tigrayans. Most of the people between Dese and the capital are Maharan and Oromo. Nevertheless, there have been several incidents in the capital recently. Bombs were placed in the fuel depot at the airport last month, and a small power station nearby was blown up."
NWS NWS-A1K-002 -0.12 "PUB ROCK /Pint-sized rock ‘n’ rollers: Jim White selects the best of the London pub venues and gigs in the weeks ahead By JIM WHITE GENERAL TIPS A general rule for pub rock patrons is that the quality of music will be in inverse proportion to the quality of the beer (except at Finsbury Park's Sir George Robey where an excellent music policy comes complete with a decent pint of Guinness). Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage, it will be a good evening. There are two types of pub rock occasions: those, like the one described above, where the band is likely to suffer from agrophobia; and those where the pub is so crowded, death through asphixiation seems to be the only way to get out. There is no half-way house. If it's a comfortable evening's entertainment you're after, stay at home with the video. Dress varies, but will never be up. WHO TO WATCH While the best that chart music can manage in the way of band names is Black Box, the pub circuit has always been ripe with imaginative handles. Cheerfully bending ears this week somewhere in London are Bald Howlin' Bastard, Daisy Chainsaw, The Wandering Crutchless, Benny Profane, The Gordon Jackson Five and New Fast Automatic Daffodils. We have no idea whether the music matches the nomenclature, but it must be worth £5 of anyone's money to encourage them. PLAYING THIS WEEK TONIGHT Bop Brothers Blues Band The plethora of litigation surrounding Blues Brothers lookalikes almost matches that attached to the release of Wired, the unofficial biography of the original brother, John Belushi. Suffice to say, whether Boogie, Bop or simply Blues, this set of Brothers, whatever they once were before they fell out and dispatched solicitors to sue their siblings, will be wearing dark glasses, pork pie hats, black side-burns and will be playing Stax/Atlantic type material. Can't fail to be entertaining. Oh, all right it can. Weavers Arms, 98 Newington Green Rd, N1 (226 6911) 8.30pm £2. Near Death Experience Hopefully simply a band name, not a prediction. Loud and tuneless, but has that ever been a problem before? King's Head Fulham (details below) 8pm £2. Well Loaded Much talked-about guitar rockers, generally regarded as destined for the bigger stadia of life, unless they self-destruct en route. Catch them young. Powerhaus, at the Pied Bull 1 Liverpool Rd, N1 (837 3218) 7.30pm £3. The Vapour Corporation Power pop, which means don't expect to leave with your eardrums intact. Cricketers, Kennington Oval (735 3059) 8pm £3. Johnny Mars Blues Band Unrepentant Smiths fans need not beat a path to the door, this is nothing to do with Johnny Marr. Dog & Trumpet 38 Great Marlborough St, W1 (437 5559) 8pm Free. Primal Scream Not a name which would lead you to expect self-absorbed acoustic doodlings. Which is just as well, because long-haired rock is what you will get. Plough Kenton, Kenton Rd, Harrow (907 2498) 9pm £3.50. FRIDAY Dr & The Medics Silly hippies in Roy Wood cast-off costumes don't sound like the most appetising evening out, and their brief foray into the charts was a considerable embarrassment, but the good Dr's tongue is in the right place (in his cheek) and a jolly time is guaranteed. Powerhaus N1 (837 3218) 8.30pm £5. MON 9 OCT Steve Marriott & Mickey Hutton In among those on their way up, and those who will never go anywhere, the pub rock circuit plays host to those who were once really something. Marriott was the chirpy Cockney sparrer who lead The Small Faces, who performed that strange pigeon-toed shuffle on Top of the Pops and wrote ‘Lazy Sunday Afternoon’. Now he steps out on beer-stained carpets and decaying floor-boards, but the conviction remains as strong. Best of all he seems to enjoy himself. Not, in truth, a pub rock venue, but certainly a pub rock act. The Monday Club, The Limelight, Shaftesbury Ave, W1 434 0572. 9pm. WHERE TO GO Bull & Gate, 389 Kentish Town Rd, NW5 (485 5358). Small but perfectly formed for pub rocking (ie sweaty and restricted view from all but the front three rows). The front bar, if the noise level becomes too oppressive, has prints of Lester Piggott decorating the wall, and a pool table. Dog & Dumpling, 13 Southgate Rd, N1 (359 6596). Not sure of the music policy, but the name sounds like the ingredients of a takeaway from a less salubrious Chinese. Dublin Castle 94 Parkway, NW1 (485 1773) Beloved of Camden's grunge rock enthusiasts, a temple to R'n'B, complete with priceless memorabilia decorating the brown-painted (or nicotine-stained) walls. Back room stage so small the performers have to rest their mike stands on the floor in front. Fulham Greyhound 175 Fulham Palace Rd, W6 (385 0526) Home of heavy rock, so take your ear-plugs. Consistently fine and determined music policy. Half Moon Putney 93 Lower Richmond Rd, SW15 (788 2387) Better known for its jazz, but a good, wholesome venue for rock nonetheless. King's Head, Fulham 4 Fulham High St, SW6 (736 1413) L-shaped room, part corridor, part bar, part dance-floor, with the stage in one corner, ensuring restricted view from virtually everywhere. Perhaps the best atmosphere around, with uninhibited dancing and whelping. New Pegasus 109 Green Lanes, N16 (226 5930) Pub which has gone through several incarnations, most recently known as Chas'n'Dave's. The odd policy to put the stage in the middle of the room rather than at one end leads to a diminishing of the atmosphere (the corners are seldom filled). The stains on the carpet have survived every name change. Sir George Robey 240 Seven Sisters Rd N4 (263 4581) Named after an old musical hero, located opposite the old Rainbow, the venerable old rock institution which is now home to a religious sect. Lots of old posters on the wall. Smelly back room, perfect for the sweatier excesses of the form."
NWS NWS-A1L-001 -0.29 "Ripping yarns and moral minefields: Allan and Janet Ahlberg talk to Celia Dodd about their bestsellers for children By CELIA DODD THESE days, no one questions the importance of good books for the under-fives. But books that appeal to adults too are just as important; we are, after all, the ones who have to do the reading. There are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate. Story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood, a real meeting of adult and child minds. With the Ahlbergs' books, it very often is. The husband-and-wife partnership behind such classics as The Jolly Postman, Burglar Bill and The Baby's Catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humour. They win their parents over with a rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring. Their books are usually set nostalgically in the past — the Thirties and Forties are favourite periods — and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes. Yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures. The Ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of life, of being too cosy and sweet, but their latest picture book, Bye Bye Baby, published today, breaks the mould. In it, a small child roams the streets, talking to strangers, until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram. Curious subject matter for a children's picture book, you might think, and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet-eyed children's book world. But the Ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their work. How, they argue, would Alice, or The Wind in the Willows, stand up against such scrutiny? The way to look at Bye Bye Baby, they insist, is as a ‘light, surreal comedy’. ‘Certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story, it's a minefield,’ Allan Ahlberg says. Bye Bye Baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator Janet Ahlberg's hand. The visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for Start-rite shoes, showing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue — an innocent image if ever there was one. The Ahlberg version features a solitary figure. The advert gave the story its vaguely Thirties setting. The success of the Ahlbergs' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage. In spite of apparently incompatible personalities — she is small and shy, he is large and does most of the talking — they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work, a persistent mutual pestering. The strength of the partnership is highlighted for Allan, who also works with a number of other artists. The time-consuming nature of Janet's part in the process, combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day, means she cannot keep up with her husband's prolific output. ‘With other illustrators, I work at a distance — we visit and phone, but there is a point at which I can't pester them any more,’ Allan says. They see themselves not as author and illustrator, with separate roles, but as a partnership of ‘book-makers’, contributing equally to the process. Allan Ahlberg says: ‘In the past, a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery, but when you tried to read the book, there was nothing there, because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on.’ Given the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and pictures, the couple's working lives are surprisingly separate. They claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work, meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen. Their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica, who is likely to be seen with her head buried in The Beano or a Roald Dahl novel, has provided the inspiration for many of her parents' books. As a baby, she was fascinated by the Mothercare Catalogue, and so The Baby's Catalogue, which documents the paraphernalia of the infant's small world in minute detail, was born. Allan's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideas. The couple still maintain close links with local schools, where they spend hours researching, sketching and absorbing jokes. After 10 years of teaching Allan had had enough. ‘I ran out of steam. It's a killing job. Little kids eat you alive, they want so much physically and emotionally.’ Every year he would have half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely read. He treated reading as a team effort, getting them to read the Daily Mirror rather than the dull, babyish books on offer. These days, he writes the books intended to help children learn to read. ‘A lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories. There's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use many words.’ Writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex, as the arbiters of the modern child's mores — librarians, teachers and publishers — lay down ever more stringent criteria. ‘The problem with children's books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned with, for example, the way girls were always discriminated against in the past,’ says Allan. ‘That is bad, and must be thought about. But people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription, that you sit down and say, you don't want it to be sexist, you don't want it to be racist. In reality you just invent a tale, as if you were sitting round a fire in a cave.’ In fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the Ahlbergs. Their books are full of female breadwinners and New Men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hours. Although they are a principled pair — they once turned down the Smarties Award on moral grounds — the Ahlbergs reject the notion of children's author as moralist. ‘I would say, just sit down and tell a good story, and to hell with the morality,’ Allan Ahlberg declares. With that characteristically strong statement, he puts his finger on the secret of the Ahlbergs' phenomenal success with adults and children alike."
NWS NWS-A7Y-009 -0.39 "An opening at the Met Despite resistance by its more conservative elements, the Metropolitan Police has begun a process of reform that should lead to improvements in the way it operates and encourage better relations with the public. THROUGH the corridors of Scotland Yard, a wind of change is blowing. The small faction of senior officers who believe that the police must undertake radical reform in order to remain viable has gained an increasingly confidentially in the shape of the Metropolitan Commissioner, Sir Peter Imbert. Implicitly, they have accepted many of the criticisms made for more than a decade by Labour councils and civil libertarians: that a force which has dug itself in behind ramparts of elitist isolationism must begin to respond to demands of the public it serves and their political representatives. Sir Peter speaks frequently of ‘power sharing,’ a notion which goes well beyond mere participation in the local consultative groups established by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. It is no coincidence that since Sir Peter became Commissioner in 1987, the relationship between Scotland Yard and London's 13 Labour authorities has seen a new detente. With the new Home Secretary, David Waddington, displaying a marked lack of enthusiasm for Sir Peter's other pet project, the creation of a national detection agency, senior officers are beginning to consider the prospect of a Labour Home Office with equanimity. They find themselves, for the first time, able to contemplate the two main features of Labour policy, greater independence in the investigation of complaints and a London police authority, with something less than total horror. The signs of reform were stirring before the advent of Sir Peter. The anonymous authors of the 1986 annual Met internal appraisal, for example, wrote in deeply critical terms of the effects of government economic policy on the inner city, and the consequences for policing. But the seminal event was Sir Peter's decison to publish A Force for Change, the survey carried out last year by the Wolff Olins consultancy. The report said that the Met was scruffy, rude, and operating from shabby police stations. These important barriers in the fostering of a good realtionship with the public were bad enough: but the force was also undertrained, riven with internal struggle, and isolated from society — in a ‘state of siege’. Most policemen felt beleaguered and misunderstood, their isolation further deepened by criticism from politicians and the media. Reforming and reactionary police officers are not unaware that public confidence in the police has meanwhile ebbed away. Causes celebres like the Guildford Four are bad enough: ‘Frankly, we all know the criminal justice system is in tatters,’ one superintendent said last week. But as demonstrated by a variety of research — including both internal police studies and external work like the 1985 Islington Crime Survey — more damaging still is the accumulation of the public's direct and disappointing contacts with police. The publication of A Force for Change was crucial because it represented an important internal victory for the reformers, and established glasnost as the principle by which the Met was to be put right. The conservatives at the Yard, who include the considerable figure of the Deputy Commissioner, John Dellow, believe that the Met has been reorganised quite enough recently and has been unsettled by a succession of commissioners, all with strong and mutually conflicting ideas. In their opinion, the calling in of Wolff Olins was more of a symptom of this malaise than any kind of cure. The Wolff Olins authors commented that the publication of their work represented a ‘profound cultural change’. This, they said, should accompany the ‘profound managerial change’ which must be next on the agenda, somehow to tackle Londoners' personal and local dissatisfaction with the police. THE main public response to A Force for Change is the Plus Programme, a continuing series of measures drawn up by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charles Pollard and Commander Alec Marnoch. Reports of the programme have concentrated on its cosmetic aspects. But its greater underlying significance is demonstrated by the fact that it, too, has been strongly opposed by Yard conservatives. According to members of the reforming faction, some officers have attempted to use Sir Peter Imbert's apparent discomfiture over his role in the Guildford Four case to discredit the Plus Programme, with which he is closely identified. At the heart of the strategy is a change of balance in the police's own perception of their role. For 150 years, police have regarded their job as the control of crime and criminals, of coping with social deviancy. Under the programme, what internal documents describe as the ‘public service tradition’ of the Met is to be emphasised as never before. Aggressive behaviour is to be not only discouraged but monitored and disciplined: the public regarded as consumers, customers and paymasters of policing, not potential villains or troublemakers. Accompanying the programme is To Serve and Protect, 10 commandments for everyday policing issued to every officer, after consultation over its text with MPs and community organisations. The first ‘value of every member of the organisation’ is ‘to uphold the law fairly and firmly’. But some of the others are less familiar. Stressing the need ‘to behave in a manner which is neither racist nor sexist,’‘to uphold individual rights,’ and ‘to cooperate and consult with the community and other agencies in pursuing our purpose’has not gone down well with conservative officers. It would be possible to dismiss the Plus Programme as merely an expression of a different style, without substance or commitment to institutional change. Evidence that it is not is provided by a confidential, internal report on CID work circulated to senior officers earlier this year, the Crime Investigation Priority Project (CIPP). Its authors, significantly, were not an outside firm but police officers. Identifying many of the same failings as Wolff Olins, CIPP's first core recommendation was ‘that crime investigation should be made victim-focussed,’ and that CID departments give ‘higher priority to the victims of crime and witnesses’. The needs of victims, it continued, ‘can be clearly stated, are feasible and are not being met. An orientation towards customers’ needs and rights is becoming a prevailing ethos in society which the police cannot ignore.’ But, CIPP said, ‘a number of officers we interviewed do not understand these needs.’ The report went on: ‘Victim satisfaction is not directly linked to the outcome of individual investigations. It is much more closely concerned with how closely the police adhere to the kind of standards the public expects from any large organisation, including promptness, a sympathetic attitude which indicates individual attention, some conspicuous activity and clear information about what will happen next.’ It was CIPP which first recommended the abolition — announced earlier this week — of the controversial system of crime screening, by which many offences were not investigated because of a lack of evidence. It was ‘discouraging officers from investigating crimes fully’, even those which could be cleared up. The report made a series of recommendations on increasing CID strength, which has fallen sharply from 10 per cent of the force in 1973 to 7.4 per cent, despite an overall large increase in numbers and a recommendation by Her Majesty's Inspectorate that provincial CIDs should make up 12.4 per cent of police. These are now being implemented. But the most significant part of CIPP dealt with institutional change: the perestroika to follow Sir Peter Imbert's glasnost which, if implemented, would represent exactly the ‘profound managerial change’ recommended by Wolff Olins. The height and extent of the inbuilt hurdles in the way of reforming a police force are not commonly appreciated. The incoming chairman of a public company can swiftly dispose of dead wood, to arrange a board in sympathy with new policies. But police officers can be dismissed only if severe disciplinary charges are proven against them. It is possible to arrange retirements on spurious ‘medical’ grounds, but this practice was heavily criticised by the Commons Home Affairs select committee earlier this year. The ensuing problems for a reforming commissioner begin at the top, with the Scotland Yard policy committee — the deputy, assistant and deputy assistant commissioners, by whom all major changes have, effectively, to be ratified. The reformer, like a US president with a recalcitrant supreme court, can secure a majority in his favour only as they retire, die or move on to better things. BROUGHT about by lifetime tenure The lack of accountability is analagous at divisional level. Conservative CIDs, for example, have all sorts of tricks to frustrate an incoming radical chief superintendent, by which they can legally send clear-up rates into a tailspin — so leading to the rapid transfer of the reforming senior officer. Incredibly, it is almost impossible even to return a detective to uniform simply on the grounds that he isn't very good. CIPP grasped this nettle. Supervision of subordinates ‘is focussed on bureaucratic procedures and not on the quality of service at the point of delivery to the public.’ All supervising officers, including senior divisional managers — chief superintendents —‘should not only hold themselves accountable, but be actively held accountable for the overall level of their subordinates’. To achieve these goals, senior police officers needed a weapon: what the CIPP report delicately called ‘deselection’. This might, it said, mean the removal of CID officers to uniform. However, ‘many officers interviewed were in favour of administrative dismissal, not currently available under police regulations.’ An overwhelming majority of those who still baulked at actual sacking favoured return to uniform, with the view that ‘CID officers who are lazy and incompetent were so primarily because of the absence of the eventual sanction of removal from specialist duty.’ Sir Peter Imbert and the Yard reformers have important allies in the regional forces: Geoffrey Dear, the West Midlands chief constable, whose boldness at disbanding his serious crimes squad cannot be discounted, whatever his eventual career ambitions; and Paul Condon, the new Kent chief, formerly in charge of Met training and personnel. But circumstances, and the perceived depth of public alienation, are driving even natural conservatives into their camp. Presently underway is a huge opinion survey of police and their customers, covering policing priorities, the quality of service provided, screening and the image of the force. Its co-sponsor is none other than the Police Federation, the junior officers' staff association, traditionally the organisation most wary of reform. OVERNIGHT FILE PAGE soc"
NWS NWS-A8M-001 -0.32 "Katie Campbell talks talk Gift of the gab GOSSIP. I love it. Unashamedly, unrepentingly. Most people do, though few will admit it these days. To gossip: to natter, to prattle, to chatter, to tittle-tattle, to jabber, to jaw. As far back as 700 BC Hesiod was wary of it: ‘Gossip is mischievous, light and easy to raise, but grievous to bear and hard to get rid of.’ In other words, mud sticks. But gossip hasn't always had such bad press. Even Oscar Wilde called it charming — granted he was one of history's great gossipers, but he was an even greater gossipee. It has often been noted that while barbarians fight with hatchets, civilised men fight with gossip. Well, frankly, I'd rather have a little mud than a hatchet thrown at my back. And gossip needn't be malevolent; my Little Oxford Dictionary defines it simply as ‘informal talk, esp about persons.’ In any case, when someone gossips well they are called a wit or a conversationalist; only those who gossip badly are tarred with the appellation ‘Gossip’. Good gossip must have an esential core of truth to it, and a dose of compassion, concern or at least good humour attached; it is bad gossip that has no basis in fact, that is driven obviously and primarily by maliciousness. That sort of gossip certainly should be condemned; that is the sort Hesiod warned against. But even he went on to say that gossip has ‘a kind of divinity’. And Seneca seven hundred years later spoke of ‘that most knowing of persons —(the) gossip’. The word gossip itself actually means ‘God's kin’. Originally it was a term of respect denoting a godparent — as Queen Elizabeth I was the gossip at the baptism of her godson James VI, or indicating friends with a common spiritual bond. Following the peasant habit of referring to any elder as ‘Mother/Father’ or ‘Grandmother/Grandfather’, the word was also applied to any gathering of older folk. It was only when it began to be associated exclusively with women that gossip began its slippery slide into the gutter. From denoting women friends or gossips, the word came to denote the speech of gossips. And so it acquired its contemporary, pejorative connotation of idle chatter. There is a theory that gossip is a form of speech particular to women — to women, old people, servants and slaves. In other words, to the powerless. But while Daisy and Rose were gossiping in the downstairs pantry, does anybody really doubt what Lord Bellamy was doing upstairs in the drawing room? Discussing affairs of state — no doubt. The sort of affairs that lose elections and topple governments. Not philosophy, not theology, but — you guessed it — gossip. A psychiatrist friend of mine recently returned from an international conference in Athens. When I asked him what those eminent shrinks did with themselves in the evenings he explained that they gathered in the hotel bar. ‘And what did you all talk about?’ ‘Shop-talk: who's getting ahead, and how, and why; who's feuding with whom; who's working with whom; who's screwing with whom.’ ‘Oh, you mean gossip.’ ‘No!’ he protested, indignantly. ‘We were talking shop; it was shop-talk, not gossip.’ When Lawson resigned the pundits gathered, and mused, and offered up their conjectures and reflections, and it was called Political Speculation. When women gather to do the same, it is called gossip. When academics delve into someone's life it is called Biography; when therapists posit theories on human behaviour it is called Psychology; when sociologists ruminate on society it is called Sociology. When women ponder on an individual, emotion or social phenomenon, it is called Gossip. So what exactly is gossip — this thing that is so reviled and condemned? Gossip is Speculation. About human affairs, about human motives, actions and desires. As women are largely responsible for the emotional wellbeing of society, it is hardly surprising that the shop-talk of women is gossip. Gossip is Old Wives' Tales. Women's wisdom has long been feared: Old Women, Witches, Sibyls, Seers. Those who scorn or censure women's talk diminish women. Or seek to. Gossip is Stories. Stories provide entertainment, but also instruction. The best, most satisfying gossip is like the best, most satisfying art; it is cathartic. Through gossip we learn from other people's lives without undergoing the pain or danger of their experiences. In short, gossip is a chronicle of humanity. As Ogden Nash put it, ‘Another good thing about gossip is that it is within everybody's reach/And it is much more interesting than any other form of speech…’ Imagine if Colette or Jane Austen or Dorothy Parker or Chaucer or Shakespeare or Marcel Proust had lived in a world without gossip! Their works would be skeletal; their insights would be meagre and mean. You can keep your philosophers speculating on language or your theologians speculating on God, I'll speculate on the human heart — gossip's good enough for me."
NWS NWS-AA3-001 -0.28 "Another disturbing chapter in the history of the DTI Notebook. By Alex Brummer THERE will be those who portray the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration on the Barlow Clowes Affair as a triumph for the British system of financial regulation. Yes, of course, they will say, there is clear evidence that the Department of Trade and Industry fouled up badly — maladministration as the Ombudsman likes to call it. But what is really important, it will be argued, is that the system triumphed. As a result of the Ombudsman's vigorous and admirably speedy deliberations, the hapless 18,000 investors who put their faith in the DTI imprimatur will be fully compensated and the integrity of the UK's investment apparatus has been preserved. Moreover, if there was maladministration it is of little consequence now in that the new regime established by the Financial Services Act of 1986 has rendered the DTI's role in this matter redundant. Such muddled thinking partly explains the complacency of the Corporate and Consumer Affairs Minister, Mr John Redwood, who accepted the findings ‘without prejudice.’ This cool response almost certainly reflects legal caution, but also a bland faith in the regulatory system. Even before the report went to the printers, the Ombudsman, Sir Anthony Barrawclough, was told by the DTI's most senior officer that it intended to give its own view, in a separate document, on the responsibilities of regulators. This is the kind of self-righteous behaviour at which Mrs Thatcher's Government excels. The DTI's record in regulatory matters is not an honourable one. Few drivers who bought car insurance policies from Dr Emil Savundra's Fire Auto & Marine in the mid-1960s will forget the culpability of then Board of Trade. Nor will those investors and depositors who in the mid-1970s found themselves caught in a hurricane sweeping throught the secondary banking system after the collapse of Gerald Caplan's London and County Securities. Suffice it to say that the DTI was the supervising authority for such fringe banks. More recently its inconsistent behaviour over the publication of DTI reports into important City scandals has also raised questions of judgment, undue political influence and its due care to the public interest. Tiny Rowland may have become a bore with his obsession over DTI's failure to publish the report on the House of Fraser — but on this occasion he is on the side of the Gods. There can be no sense in the DTI's refusal to publish the House of Fraser report on the grounds that it might prejudice a Serious Fraud Office inquiry when it took the opposite course over Blue Arrow. And while one is busy throwing the rotten eggs, who can forget the duplicity of the DTI over the disposal of Rover to British Aerospace. It would be nice to write that despite these lapses of judgment, not to mention the occasional maladministration, investors and other stakeholders in business do not have to worry because of the safety superstructure which has been built since. But there is little in the current regulatory structure which is designed to inspire the confidence of investors. Indeed, even if supervision of Barlow Clowes had passed seamlessly from the DTI to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (FIMBRA) there can be no guarantee the warning signs at Barlow Clowes, from intermingled funds to accounting inconsistencies, would have been unearthed. With its unwieldly band of almost 8,200 members FIMBRA is an organisation in serious distress. It is engaged in internecine warfare over the general provision of indemnity insurance for investors. But this dispute, which has seen FIMBRA's Lord Elton off the field, is evidence of systemic problem. The organisation, concerned with financial probity, is continuously in debt because its members refuse to pay the bill for self-regulation. Moreover, its attempts to weed out the next Barlow Clowes are not considered impressive. When suspending members for alleged wrongdoing it tends to act in the dark of night, refusing generally to explain its actions. FIMBRA's incontinence is evidence of a system of self-regulation under stress. With the populous FIMBRA offshoot of the Securities & Investment Board (SIB) bucking against the post-Financial Services Act regime, the whole concept of self-regulatory organisations is brought into question. The Stock Exchange, for instance, has been remarkably successful in doing its own policing — witness the quick action taken in the case of the alleged share ramp at Williams Holdings. But in contrast, the DTI has not been notably successful in bringing prosecutions against insiders based on the dossiers provided — as the Geoffrey Collier case demonstrates. Even the SIB itself appears to be having self-doubts about the unwieldly monster it has created, particularly at a time when the City's self-regulation will have to be grafted on a more legalistic European Community framework. The most interesting observations by the Ombudsman in the Barlow Clowes report concern the DTI's vision of regulation. It points out that the licensing functions were lowly regarded and observes that protection of investors by definition requires a ‘rigorous and inquiring approach’. Such comments about the DTI's effectiveness as a corporate policeman could have been made almost at any time over the last 30 years and in a multitude of cases. Similarly, successive attempts by the City to regulate itself have, as in the case of FIMBRA, ended in disappointment. It is easy to forget, for instance, that the Bank of England is still nursing along the remains of that 1970s darling, Slater-Walker. Financial shenanigans clearly will not be eliminated by new, even tougher legislation to protect investors. There is more than enough statutory law around. What is needed are effective regulators and that is the common thread which runs from John Bloom and Bernie Cornfeld to Peter Clowes and Guinness. Investors deserve a stronger, simpler and more tenacious system of enforcement than self-regulation can provide. It is up to government to finance and provide it — but as far from the DTI as possible."
NWS NWS-BM4-047 -0.24 "The diary PUBLIC SPEAKERS COME SECOND THE Senior team from Churcher's College in Petersfield came second in the district final of the Rotary Club's Youth Speaks competition on Friday at Southampton University. Speaking on the theme of ‘Where has all the magic gone?’ the team — Caroline Pollington, James Nicholls and Daniel Ogus — did well to get ahead of opposition from Southampton, Portsmouth and Bournemouth. But they met their match in Ryde School from the Isle of Wight, who pipped them for victory. The Churcher's team prize as runners-up was £35. PAINT THE ENVIRONMENT SCHOOLS around Petersfield have been invited to contribute to a mural competition to decorate the panels around the Tilmore Walk scheme. The district council's latest move is related to Environment Week due to start on May 11th, when the murals should be completed. The best mural patterns will be awarded cash prizes from the district and Petersfield Town Council. They will also supply a panel to each school; paint is being provided by Prudential, developers of the project. The object is to design and create a mural panel with the theme of the environment and methods of conservation. The competition is divided into two age groups, six-eleven and 12–16. Entries will be judged not on technical points but on the use of colour, space and understanding of the environmental theme. The decorations will remain on the boards until completion of the town centre scheme. CHOIR SHAPE UP BORDON'S new and as yet unnamed choir are looking forward to an illustrious future. They recently held their first practice session at Barbados House, which turned out to be a rousing occasion. The founder of the choir, Donald Carter, has announced a further practice session at the same venue on Tuesday, starting at 7.30 p.m. WALK THE DOG FOR CHARITY STEEP, Stroud and Petersfield Show are holding a Butser Trail sponsored dog walk in aid of the new Petersfield Hospital and the International League for the Protection of Horses. The event starts at 11.15 a.m. on May 3rd but participants should arrive at 11 o'clock to prepare for the three-mile trail. All dogs should be kept on a lead and walkers without dogs are still welcome. All who finish will be given free entry to the show on July 26th. The organisers ask that cars should be parked on the Butser Hill side of the A3 within the Queen Elizabeth Country Park. A NEW BRANCH FOR AMNESTY? ANYONE interested in forming a Petersfield group of Amnesty International is invited to attend a meeting in the Exhibition Room of the County Library in The Square on Tuesday at 7.30 p.m. The regional representative of Amnesty International, Peter Mills, will speak about and answer questions on the organisation and the work carried out by local groups. This will be followed by a discussion on the next steps to be taken. More information is available from Brenda Pullen or Louise Banks. ADVICE ON TRANQUILLISER ADDICTION GUILDFORD Counselling Centre — part of the Surrey Alcohol and Drug Advisory Service — are manning a stand at the Friary Centre, Guildford on Monday. The theme will be tranquilliser addiction and the many problems experienced by those affected and those recovering from this addiction. The stand will be open all day to provide friendly and informal information, and a selection of relevant literature will be available. Tranquilliser addiction, unlike alcohol and illegal drug addiction, is a prescribed problem which cause long term distress instead of the desired short term cure. It results from the attempt to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses and has only recently begun to be recognised. The Tranquilliser Support Group are on 0483 579313. RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING THE Hampshire branch of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society will be holding their annual general meeting on May 9th at Holy Trinity Church Hall, Upper Brook Street, Winchester, starting at 10.30 a.m. FOCUS ON THE WEY ALTON'S River Wey may be featured on BBC TV South this week as part of a series showing the effect on wildlife of the lowering water table. A camera team were filming at Flood Meadows on Tuesday when presenter Paul Clifford interviewed Susan Bellamy of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Naturalists Trust. The Wey springs have failed in Alton this year leaving the river bed bone dry, the frogs still return. The springs normally rise in January and February. ‘But we haven't had enough rain to replenish the water table which is itself in drought,’ pointed out Susan. She fears for the future of the river's wildlife. NEW HOSPITAL CHIEF EXECUTIVE A NEW chief executive has been appointed for the King Edward VII Hospital at Midhurst. Paul Benson, who is aged 39, will take over from John Goldsworthy at the 175-bed hospital, which is now one of the largest West Sussex employers with a staff of some 500 people. Having worked in both the NHS and in independent healthcare management, Mr. Benson was recently based in London as director of human resources for BUPA Health Services. Mr. Benson, who is married with a two-year-old son, lives near Havant and will take up his post at the end of April. SPONSOR ANDREW LISS teenager Andrew Brewster is hoping to raise £1,000 for Guide Dogs for the Blind when he walks from Alton to Kingsley and back on April 1st. Andrew, aged 18, is a student at Andover and Basingstoke Training Ltd., and can be contacted for sponsorship on Alton 80472. EMBROIDERERS HOST FESTIVAL THE Petersfield branch of the Embroiderers Guild are hosts of this year's south west region festival. Embroiderer and writer Beryl Dean will be speaking on Present Day Ecclesiastic Embroidery. Pam Watts complements the all-day agenda with Machine Embroidery in the Home. Trade stands and demonstrations will be open during the lunch hour. The Town Mayor of Petersfield, Eric Goffe, will open the proceedings at the Petersfield Festival Hall tomorrow. VAL'S THE BEST STAFF at Boots, Alton, have voted Val Fitzpatrick the best assistant in the store. She will now go on to the next leg of the Boots Customer Service Award — the district semi-finals. If she is victorious in the area stage of the contest, Mrs. Fitzpatrick will be among 18 finalists in with a shot of the 1992 title in June. EXPLORING COUNTRY PARKS QUEEN Elizabeth Country Park are presenting an all day lecture on the Attractions of East Hampshire. The talk will explore the sights and features of country parks in the East Hampshire area. The venue is the Park Centre this coming Sunday. CHANCE FOR YOUNG SINGERS THE Hampshire County Youth Choir were formed last October to give young people aged 15 to 20 years the opportunity to take part in a higher standard of choral singing than perhaps would be open to them at their schools or colleges. The choir, funded by Hampshire County Council, proved their potential at their first concert in December and have now several other events planned including concerts in Southampton Guildhall and Winchester Cathedral. Vacancies still exist for tenors and basses in particular and also there are a few spaces for contraltos. Any young singers who would like further information can contact Keith Smith. THEY'RE AFTER YOUR VOTE VARIOUS political ‘big guns’ have appeared in the Winchester constituency to boost their party's candidates in the election campaign. Liberal Democrat Tony Barron was given a boost by Lord (Roy) Jenkins at a meeting in Winchester on Tuesday last week. His colleague from the East Hampshire constituency, the Hon. Susan Baring, was also at the meeting. The following day, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd appeared in the city, endorsing Conservative candidate Gerald Malone. And on Monday, the Winchester Tories were visited by Sir Leon Brittan, on a tour of the Wessex area. But none of these party heavyweights have, so far, found their way down the road to Alton. OPEN DAY AT THE CLINIC THE Fairfields Clinic, owned by Alton GP Dr. Chris Everett, will be holding an open day tomorrow (Saturday) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. to demonstrate the benefits of natural medicine. Situated in Fairfields Road, Basingstoke the clinic attracts many patients from the Alton area. Available are aromatherapy, medical hypnotherapy, vasectomy counselling and operations, reflexology and a menopause and HRT clinic. Admission to the clinic open day is free — all welcome. CAMPAIGN AGAINST HUNTING ENDS WE hear that there was a big attendance at the first meeting of the new Basingstoke branch of the League Against Cruel Sports, when the League's information officer, Kevin Flack, told them: ‘I believe that most people are opposed to hunting but it has been recent antics of the Quorn Hunt and publicity from the MacNamara Bill that has convinced them that something has to be done to put an end to their activities.’ Area representative James Hampton said that the role of local support groups was vital is the League's work in putting pressure on politicians and publicising the nature of hunting was to continue. ‘We have a real chance in the lifetime of the next parliament to see an end to the hunting of live animals with dogs for fun.’ Further information from Mr. Hampton. CYCLING CLUB FORMED A PETERSFIELD couple are planning to form a cycling club in Petersfield. It is aimed at all ages and for every type of cyclist. Ability will be taken into account when planning distance and duration of rides. Day, evening and weekend trips are planned along with a programme of meetings with invited speakers to discuss areas of common interest especially the general aspects of cycle safety. Organisers Brian and Christine Johns are keen cyclists and are both members of the Cycle Tourist Club, the promoters of recreational cycling. For more details ring Mr. Johns. BOOST FOR AGE CONCERN AGE Concern is the chosen charity of the chairman of East Hampshire District Council, Elsa Bulmer, during her year of office. Petersfield Rugby Club are helping Mrs. Bulmer organise a May Ball as a fund-raising event, and it will take place in a specially erected marquee at Penns Place adjacent to the club on May 1st. The evening will include a Bucks Fizz welcome, dinner, live big band, disco and cabaret. Tickets are available from Julia Fry at East Hampshire District Council or from Elsa Bulmer. CHURCHWARDEN ELECTED BLACKMOOR has a new churchwarden — Chris Turner was elected at Sunday's Easter vestry meeting. The annual parochial church meeting heard the latest report on the £30,000 appeal for restoring outside stonework on the church. Just under £6,000 has been raised so far. It is hoped that work will start this year. They are waiting to hear from English Heritage and are also hoping for a grant from the East Hampshire District Council. ART ON SHOW EDWARDIAN Images, the watercolours of Hampshire artist Mertin Shape, go on show at Alton's Allen Gallery tomorrow (Saturday). The exhibition, which continues until May 2nd, will illustrate the changes in the county's landscape over the last century. Mr. Shape comes from Gosport, and the paintings are all from the town's museum. The exhibition is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays to Saturdays. CYCLE SAFETY CYCLE coding will take place at Alton police station on Sunday. Anyone who wishes to have their bike security marked should pop along between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.

NWS NWS-K2E-007 -0.01 "A degree of frustration With the influx of students from the Republic what does the future hold for Ulster's high-flyers? THE 2,000-odd students from the Republic who choose to study in Northern Ireland are a streetwise crowd. They know all about how to exploit the EC rules in order to obtain a free university education, all fees paid by the Department of Education at Rathgael, outside Bangor, Co Down. This should not surprise you, for it happens also to be the case that they tend to be an exceptionally well-qualified crowd. My authority for saying that is the Reader in Sociology at Queen's University, Robert Cormack, some of whose latest findings have been discussed in this newspaper by Claire McGahan this week. Mr Cormack is just back from a conference of academics held at Turku, a Finnish port on the Baltic coast east of Helsinki, where he and his colleague, Robert Osborne, gave a paper on the pattern of higher education here. It is fascinating stuff, both for what it says and what it leaves unsaid. He makes the point that the arrival of these southerners (and westerners) has enabled the University of Ulster to push up the minimum entry grades for some courses. He says this has been a deliberate policy at UU for some time. But the obvious question arises: if the bright sparks from the Republic are coming in, who here is being crowded out? Because we know that, as Mr Cormack puts it, ‘not all leavers’ who go to England and Scotland to take their degrees ‘are willing leavers’. He points out that the young fellow or girl with only modest ‘A’ levels now has little choice: they have to do without — or go across the water. But if that is so, who are they? Here comes the rub. Mr Cormack does not say. But I have digested his paper and, well loaded with statistics, have been making one or two inquiries of my own. His figures show that very many students from working-class homes tend to do less well in their ‘A’ levels than the rest. So any shortage of places will be likely to hit them hardest. Mr Cormack, however, shows that nearly half the Roman Catholic students entering higher education here (43pc) come from working class homes, but only a little over a quarter of the Protestants do (27pc). The conclusion is obvious; and it is that those local searchers for a place here, who are being crowded out by the southerners, are most likely to be northern Catholics. Moreover they will tend to be Catholics from just the sort of background the universities here have for years wished to see represented more adequately among students. One effect of this new competition for places locally is that the students who go to England or Scotland no longer automatically represent the elite they tended to in the 1970s and 1980s. They still include many high flyers; but Mr Cormack shows that an appreciable number are now likely to be modest attainers who were crowded out of a place at home. It is astonishing that more Protestants now study in universities on the mainland — more than a quarter — than are to be found in the University of Ulster; and if we take the total, only 55pc of Protestant students now study here. So much for bridge-building and healing local divisions; and cross-border traffic going south is barely a trickle. The Protestants are scarcely measurable and the Catholics (3pc) amount to only a quarter of the proportion who went 20 years ago. With the cost to the student of a higher education tending to rise sharply, fewer in future may be able to afford the luxury of studying across the water. Mr Cormack foresees school-leavers having to fight even harder for a place here. It may well be, in any case, that we now have a high enough proportion of school-leavers in cap and gown. Only a generation ago there were barely 2,000. This autumn we have 10,000. Perhaps we need more technically-orientated vocational courses. Perhaps the way of opportunity is the old American system: a year's study, followed by a year out to earn some money. Jobs, I know, have been very hard to come by this summer. But we must hope this will change next year with economic revival abroad. Graduates, too, face increasing job problems. A degree is no longer the magic key to a lifetime's well-paid security. There are now BA (Hons.) staffing supermarket check-outs. Are we turning out too many? What baffles me is how few of them can spell. The local office of a body which shall remain nameless was awarding competition prizes the other day. One class was for the most original entry; another was limited to the tots; a third to the over-8s. A final class sought to find the most ‘humerous.’ I hope the over-8s didn't notice."
NWS NWS-K5C-074 -0.0599999999999999 "‘Suddenly what seems to be at stake is the Britishness of being Britain' Never before has the nation's mood and morale been at such a low ebb, never before such a vote of no confidence in the country, writes Rob Brown Prepared to vote with their feet WOULD the last one out, please put off the lights! Some people may remember those words being splashed across the front page of the Sun on the eve of last April's general election. Rupert Murdoch's mass circulation tabloid stooped to a new level of vicious scaremongering when it seemed that Neil Kinnock might just succeed in leading Labour back into government. Today, however, the Sun must be wishing that it had held that headline in reserve. For it neatly encapsulates the state of public morale in Britain less than a year into the fourth consecutive Conservative term. In an opinion poll published this week, 49 per cent of the British public said that they would emigrate if they could. There has never been such a vote of no confidence in the country since Gallup began measuring the urge to emigrate in 1948. Rival pollsters have argued that this finding should be handled with some caution. They point out that disenchantment has been swollen no doubt by recent events such as the surge in unemployment past the three million mark, the murder of two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool and even the February weather. But no-one has dismissed it as a rogue poll. Other polling organisations have also detected a profound and longer-term loss of faith in the way Britain is governed. Christopher Harvie, Professor of British Studies at the University of Tubingen in Germany, has observed: ‘Britain, after a decade of Thatcherite greed-is-good radicalism is, in many respects, less competitive than it has ever been, its society bitterly divided and disorientated.’ Harvie penned those words at the beginning of last year. Dramatic developments since then — most notably Black Wednesday and the scandals engulfing the Royal Family — have only served to heighten this sense of dislocation. That is confirmed by Robert Worcester, chairman of the polling organisation Mori. ‘Over the last several decades, there has been a decline, no question about it, in the confidence people have in British institutions,’ he reports. ‘There is a declining belief in monarchy, in Westminster and Whitehall, in the judiciary and in the system of government as a whole.’ Henry Porter doubtless spoke for many when he wrote recently in the Guardian: ‘Little in the post-war years of decline in Britain has prepared us for the deep sense of unease now being experienced by its people. Suddenly what seems to be at stake is not economic and material wellbeing, but the Britishness of being Britain… ‘We have begun to lose our confidence in our institutions, the traditions and bodies that constitute a very large part of the national culture — especially in the monarchy which a year ago appeared to be one of the unassailable certainties of British life.’ How can our fragmented society make itself whole again? How can a culture permeated by possessive individualism restore the fraying bonds of community? These questions are being asked now not just by political theorists, although some of them are giving the most considered answers. David Marquand, one of Britain's most acute political analysts, has written that ‘only a notion of community, of fraternity, can make it a duty — as opposed to a compassionate whim — to help one's fellows’. In his book, The Unprincipled Society, Marquand deplored the conception of power and authority that has underpinned Britain's political order since the 18th century. He argued that our existing governmental arrangements are inimical to forging a sense of fraternity. Talk of a new constitution may still be restricted largely to the so-called chattering classes, but the general public seems to have roused from what George Orwell called ‘the deep, deep sleep of England’. In Homage to Catalonia, Orwell wrote despairingly of the fundamental contentment of those who sleep deeply in the belief that the fundamentals are secure. He was referring to that curious mixture of kings, lords and commons which have been the essential elements of Britain's unwritten — and until now unchallenged — constitution. Republicanism may not be rampant yet, but the Duchess of York's indiscretions and the Prince and Princess of Wales's separation have certainly made it more respectable. Even prominent members of the Labour Party — traditionally timid on this front — have started to argue openly that the Royal Family's role must be streamlined and modernised if it is to survive for very much longer. Perhaps the nation's mood would be cheerier if we simply had someone else in charge of our existing institutions? Shirley Williams, former Cabinet minister and founder member of the SDP, put forward this thesis last week when she flew back to Britain to be introduced to the House of Lords. Now Professor of Politics at Harvard University, she enthused in a BBC interview about how President Clinton has transformed the mood of America. ‘It's amazing what a change of government does,’ she stated. ‘Bill Clinton is not perfect, but the great thing I've seen in America is the lifting of the spirits, the sense of all things being possible again, just because they have brought to an end three administrations which were conservative. ‘It's the kind of feeling that a new world has broken, that you get after any very long period of office by one party. I think it could happen in Britain, instead of this feeling of living under a grey blanket, which you somehow have when you're back here.’ THE vast majority of Americans, it seems, are now behind Clinton. Even many voters who couldn't bring themselves to endorse him last November are prepared to believe in what he calls the politics of hope. America, unlike Britain, is of course a believing culture. As Richard Holloway, the Bishop of Edinburgh, has observed: ‘It is a culture that believes in belief…anyone who has worked on the other side of the Atlantic will recognise the syndrome. It is one that patronising and superior Brits frequently sneer at. The fact remains that for all its crassness and naivety, the American experiment is a colossal testimony to the importance of faith in human life.’ The US, of course, has a written constitution — the only one in the world where the pursuit of happiness is an enshrined goal."
