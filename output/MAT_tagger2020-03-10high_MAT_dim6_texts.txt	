HOC HOC-AR 3.79 " During their existence the RUC had to deal with many accusations made against by the Nationalist and Republican communities in Northern Ireland and their supporters elsewhere. Now that the terrorists have got their demand to disband the RUC, the are still not content. I feel that this report is just an ongoing attempt to discredit what was, in my opinion, the most effective policing service in the world. I can only imagine how those RUC officers who were on duty in Omagh on the day of the bombing now feel by the accusations made in this report, after helping to lead the rescue operation and pick of the bodies of the victims that day. It frightens me to think how many more people would have slaughtered by terrorists over the years if it hadn't been for the bravery and efficiency of the RUC during this time. This report is a serious attempt to deflect where the real blame for the Omagh atrocity lies, and that is squarely on the shoulders of the so called 'Real' IRA and their associates in other Republican groups.      As a lawyer specialising in regulatory matters I am deeply disturbed at the Ombudsman's apparent failure to give those whom she wished to criticize adequate time to comment on the facts as she found them and on her conclusions.      Instead of Sinn Fein crowing on the sidelines about the alleged ineptitude of the RUC, perhaps they would assist its successor, or indeed the Garda in helping to bring convictions. The fact that Sinn Fein is on public record in ruling out any cooperation whatsoever makes, in my opinion, that party as complicit in the Omagh tragedy as the main perpetrators.      Surely such a damning report on the conduct of the RUC regarding these events should have been more thoroughly investigated than it appears to have been. It will also do nothing to ease the suffering of the victims of this atrocity. Please, let's not turn the blame on the RUC. It lies firmly at the feet of the murderous scum that planned and executed such an unforgivable act.      Attacks on the Chief Constable and his officers who fought bravely for thirty years against tyrants and murderers in the North show how insensitive and ignorant Mrs O'Loan is, not only to the families of Omagh but also to those individuals who fought in vain to preserve life on that horrific day.      Does anybody really think Omagh was the primary target for this Real IRA outrage? I doubt it, what political gain would there be? After all Omagh is a mainly Nationalist town. I can remember distinctly the day of the Omagh bomb. I was driving the sixteen miles from Dromore Co. Down to Lisburn, Co. Antrim, and was stopped by the security forces on no less than three occasions. There was a very high state of alert. Perhaps the target was changed at the last minute by the murderers due to the high security force presence.     This appears to those outside the divide in Northern Ireland, that Sinn Fein supporters are engaged in political point scoring. It looks biased and unfair. Put a neutral officer in charge and investigate all the circumstances. However if that investigation reveals that Ronnie Flanagan is not culpable, then Nuala O' Lone should be sacked for such blatant misrepresentation. If she is prepared to attack the Chief Constable then she has to be prepared to put her own job on the line. Only in Northern Ireland could the diversionary propaganda be put forward in such a way that suggests the RUC were somehow to blame for letting the bomb through. The Real IRA blew up 29 people, now it appears that they want to finish the job they intended, by causing as much damage as possible to the new PSNI.      As the Real IRA perceives its struggle with the UK as a war, can't we start treating it as such? If we did, known guilty parties could be tried under military law, rather than civilian law, which doesn't really take into consideration the severity of these people's crimes. The Real IRA benefits from waging war on a sleeping country that is obsessed with being politically correct and following civil law to the nth degree. Our government doesn't fight for the rights of the UK civilian because it is obsessed with bending over backwards to give these terrorists what they want.      All such reports should be preceded by information regarding the background of the person compiling the report, who was consulted, who was invited to give an opinion and who actually gave an opinion. This information is important owing to the effect a report of this nature can have on society      This looks like just the kind of news NI does not need. But at least ineptitude and incompetence are not as bad as cold blooded murder. Clearly a lot of work needs to be done in the police service, but I'll wait until the Police have had a chance to reply to the report.      I think the ombudsman's report needs to be thoroughly investigated, perhaps by an outside chief constable. However no matter what the report says one thing must be remembered. The RUC did not plant the Omagh bomb.      What is evident from the Ombudsman's report is not that the Omagh bombing could definitely have been prevented, but that the Chief Constable and special branch attempted to prevent both the Omagh Investigation team and the Ombudsman's investigators from gaining access to the information that special branch had. That the internal RUC Review of the investigation was also ignored is a damning indictment of the power special branch has within what is supposed to be a Police Service. The fact that the Ombudsman has been able to uncover all of these facts is a tribute to the thoroughness of her investigators and to the office she holds. Far from vindicating Sinn Fein's refusal to endorse the new structures the transparency that the Ombudsman has brought to the workings of the PSNI underlines the fact that we are already at a new beginning to Policing here.      Getting the bombers to justice is only part of it. What we need to do is see what lesson this sad and tragic incident has taught us and ensure that the lapses are not committed again. The public first expects prevention and secondly detection. Bringing the individuals involved in this dastardly act of terrorism to justice is not only a must but a duty on every police force.      THE RUC did not bomb Omagh. It wasn't Special Branch who devised the idea of planting a car bomb in a crowded town centre on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Nor was it Ronnie Flanagan who parked that car that day and gingerly pushed the door to and then walked off down the street past the women and the children, the elderly people and the babies, knowing full well that they and hundreds of other innocents like them were now in the most grievous mortal danger.      It's important to remember these things because in the midst of all the high emotion and anger expressed this week, it has seemed at times as if we lost sight of that one overriding fact - that it was the Real IRA who bombed Omagh. And while it may be difficult for the rest of us to imagine ourselves inside their minds to try to fathom how in God's name they could conceive and perpetrate such evil, it is all too easy to guess how they feel about the row over the ombudsman's report.      They and their counterparts in other republican and loyalist terrorist groups must be gloating and sniggering over every delicious moment of it - at that unlikely turnaround which now sees those who have saved so many lives being tainted with blame for the worst atrocity of the Troubles.      This week, without a trace of obvious irony, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which planted many a similar car bomb, was calling for an independent inquiry into the police actions over Omagh. It was a bit like the political representatives of the Taliban demanding a public inquiry into the NYPD's inability to prevent the al-Qaeda attack on the Twin Towers.      The relatives of Omagh deserve justice. But the police who lost over 300 officers in the fight against terrorism deserve fair play too. The bitterness and acrimony of the current row should not be allowed to obscure the fact that whatever the failings of the system, the police were trying to save lives - unlike the men who drove that car that day into Omagh.      You can imagine the outrage if someone was to reason that it was due to the ineptitude of the CIA etc that the attacks on the Twin Towers occurred. Surely we must never forget that it was the police themselves who were on the front line and that the information available to them was scant at best. It could equally be argued that if there had been more co-operation from the nationalist community maybe the bomb would not have occurred. However, the reality remains that the motivation for it was with the Real IRA - a group of cold evil inhumane killers who were hell-bent on murder.       No one can dispute the fact that the Real IRA are responsible for setting off the bomb and for murdering and maiming innocent people, they did an evil thing and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. What is also indisputable is that it is the responsibility of the police ombudsman to investigate the police response to the bombing in light of accusations of wrongdoing. She did her job and found that certain information was not given to the people who could have made a difference and possibly prevented loss of life. If she buried the report or never did the investigation then the same thing could happen again. Hopefully this will improve the ability of the officers in the Police Service to get the information they need to better do their jobs. "

ACA ACA-B2K-008 3.9 "COLLIDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES: THE BELL-SZEKERES SOLUTION In an important paper, Bell and Szekeres (1974) gave an exact solution which describes the collision and subsequent interaction of two electromagnetic plane waves. This solution, which appears to be remarkably simple, will be described in this chapter. Other exact solutions describing colliding electromagnetic waves will be described in Chapters 16 and 17, after more powerful techniques have been developed. The Bell-Szekeres solution Bell and Szekeres have considered a very simple situation involving a collision of two step electromagnetic waves. Prior to the collision, the waves may be described by the familiar line element (4.15). In regions I and II, this takes the form  (15.1) and the step wave is given by . The opposing wave with  may be described in an identical way with the null coordinate u replaced by v , and a different space-like coordinate replacing r . The two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions I, II and III are taken to be . (15.2) The fact that both of these expressions are real simultaneously indicates that the polarization of the two electromagnetic waves is aligned. In addition, they have identical step profiles. The relative amplitudes a and b may, of course, both be equated to unity when convenient. The components of the Weyl tensor are initially all zero. By this stage, we are familiar with the fact that it is appropriate to transform the metrics in all regions into Rosen form. Accordingly, the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of (4.19) and (4.20), namely  (15.3) The initial-value problem is now well set, and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region. The field equations for colliding electromagnetic waves have already been obtained in Chapter 6. In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the gravitational field equations for the interaction region take the form (6.22), and Maxwell's equations are given by (6.21). The appropriate boundary conditions for this situation have been described in Chapter 7. As usual, it may be noted that (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give  (15 4) where f and g are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region. From the junction conditions it can be seen that, in this case, these functions necessarily take the forms:. (15.5) The solution of the complete set of equations (6.21,22) given by Bell and Szekeres is . (15.6) It can be seen that these functions satisfy the required O'Brien-Synge boundary conditions. Thus the line element in the interaction region IV is . (15.7) This line element is in fact one form of the Bertotti-Robinson solution (Bertotti 1959, Robinson 1959), which is known to be conformally flat. The coordinate transformation  (15.8) transforms the line element (15.7) into the more familiar form . (15 9) Halilsoy (1987) has considered an application of the transformation  to the above solution. However, this does not lead to any new results that are of physical significance. The structure of the solution The above solution describes the collision of two step electromagnetic waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. This follows from the fact that  is real, and . As has been pointed out above, the solution inside the interaction region IV is conformally flat. However, as Bell and Szekeres have shown, there are necessarily discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric function V across the initial boundaries of this region. These manifest themselves as the impulsive gravitational waves  (15.10) which may be considered to be generated by the collision. It is in fact a general feature of colliding electromagnetic plane waves that gravitational waves are always generated by the collision. This can easily be demonstrated by considering the field equations (6.22d, e). In the interaction region, and  are necessarily both non-zero. It follows that V and W can not both remain constant. Thus, the congruences tangent to both waves must begin to shear, and it can be seen from (6.23) that the components of the Weyl tensor  and , and possibly  will necessarily appear. In this case, the discontinuity in the electromagnetic components causes impulsive gravitational waves to be generated. It can also be shown that smooth-fronted electromagnetic waves would generate smooth-fronted or step gravitational waves that would persist through the interaction region. It may also be observed from (15.10) that difficulties occur at the points . At first sight, it would appear that curvature singularities occur at these points (Matzner and Tipler, 1984). However, curvature tensors of this type can be interpreted as distributions (see Geroch and Traschen, 1987) and, in this case, the standard definition of a curvature singularity in terms of unboundedness in a parallelly propagated frame is inapplicable. The global structure of this solution has been analysed in detail by Clarke and Hayward (1989). They have confirmed that, in regions II and III, the surfaces on which  and  respectively behave as ‘fold’ singularities similar to those of the Khan-Penrose solution described in Section 8.2. Initially, the most surprising feature of the Bell-Szekeres solution was that a space-like curvature singularity does not occur in region IV. In this case, the surface on which , which is here given by , turns out to be merely a coordinate singularity since the curvature tensor is clearly bounded. Bell and Szekeres have demonstrated how this singularity can be removed by considering the following coordinate transformation:(15.11) where . With this, the line element (15.6) becomes  (15.12) which is clearly regular when . In order to retain the one-to-one correspondence, it is appropriate initially to restrict the Bell-Szekeres coordinate x to the range . The coordinates X and Y are restricted by , where the boundary  contains the space-like plane on which the collision occurs. It has been shown by Clarke and Hayward (1989) that region IV is part of a space-time that is regular apart from two covering-space singularities that occur when . These are points on the boundary of region IV where it joins with the limits of regions II and III. At these points, which are on the polar axis  and  in the Bertotti-Robinson form of the metric (15.9),. With the above transformation, each interval of the coordinate x of length 2 π/; c corresponds to a circular region in the X ,Y plane with the origin removed and cut along the line . Neighbouring regions of x are joined together along these cuts to form a surface which continuously winds around the origin. The origin of the X ,Y plane thus corresponds to a singularity of a quasiregular covering-space type. It is also sometimes convenient (Clarke and Hayward, 1989) to make the further coordinate transformation  (15.13) With this, the line element (15.12) takes the alternative form of the Bertotti-Robinson line element  (15.14) Region IV is now described by the line element (15.14) with the coordinate ranges given by  (15.15) This is joined to regions II and III across the surfaces . (15.16) Clarke and Hayward (1989) have also shown that the Bell-Szekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface , but the extension is not unique because of the presence of the singularities. They have further suggested two possible extensions which will be described in the next section. It is also somewhat remarkable that the global structure of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as described by Clarke and Hayward (1989), is very similar to that of the collision of an impulsive gravitational wave with a null shell of matter, as described by Babala (1987). This will be discussed in Section 19.3. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have conducted a thorough perturbation analysis of this particular solution. Throughout the interaction region subsequent to the collision they have obtained a complete set  of bounded normal modes that are expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. These modes exhibit a behaviour of ever-increasing frequency as the Cauchy horizon is approached. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have also considered perturbations in the initial regions which contain the approaching waves. For the approaching wave in region II which propagates along the null line ,, they have shown that v -independent perturbations are not permitted to all orders, while all the v -dependent perturbations exhibit strong divergences along the ‘fold’ singularity. Unfortunately, these perturbations can not be joined continuously to those of the interaction region. It is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations subsequent to the collision. Extensions of the solution In the Bell-Szekeres solution, it has been shown that the hypersurface  on which the opposing waves mutually focus each other is a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. It is therefore appropriate to consider possible extensions to this solution through the horizon, even though any such extension will not be unique. Two possible extensions have been given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). One natural extension of region IV is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element (15.14). This is achieved by extending the coordinate range to  (15.17) where . In this extension, the waves cross and focus. The subsequent space-time is unchanging. Another equally natural extension of region IV is obtained by noting that the line element (15.14) admits a reflection symmetry  about the hyperplane  (or  about ). Thus, there is an extension in which region IV is extended as far as  and is then followed by the time reverse of the entire solution. In this extension, the waves cross, mutually focus each other, re-expand and then separate leaving Minkowski space between them to the future. This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1 in terms of the original null coordinates and the line elements (15.3) and (15.7). Other apparent extensions of the Bell-Szekeres solution have been suggested by Gürses and Halilsoy (1982) in which the approaching electromagnetic waves consist of a sequence of steps. The step lengths, however, have to be double the distance to the fold singularities. Thus, these  solutions necessarily extend the space-time through the covering space singularities and can not, therefore, be considered as appropriate solutions for colliding plane waves. In all these solutions the space-time can only be extended uniquely up to the fold singularities in regions II and III and the surface in region IV on which . It must therefore be concluded that the Gürses-Halilsoy extensions are not physically significant. Figure 15.1 An extension of the Bell-Szekeres space-time. Regions marked I are flat. Regions marked II and III contain electromagnetic waves with , and  respectively, having metrics given by (15.3). There are impulsive gravitational waves along the boundaries of region IV, which has metric (15.7). A non-colinear collision In the Bell-Szekeres solution, the polarization of the approaching electromagnetic waves is aligned. It is appropriate now to consider how this solution may be generalized to include the case when the polarization is not aligned. In the approaching waves a rotation of the polarization is expressed by a rotation of the components Φ 2 or Φ in the complex plane. The metrics in both regions are unaltered, since a null electromagnetic field  is defined by the metric only up to a constant duality rotation. Thus, to extend the Bell-Szekeres solution, the same initial conditions are given except that the component  becomes complex and, from (6.22e),W must become non-zero in the interaction region. A solution presented by Griffiths (1985) satisfying this condition may be written in the form  (15.18) where  (15.19) The relative polarization angle of the two waves prior to the collision is given by α. It may be noticed that the expression for U here is equivalent to those of (15.4,5) and (15.6). The common multiple 2 has been inserted so that this solution can be more directly related to the Bell-Szekeres solution to which it reduces when . It can be shown that this solution has exactly the same properties as the aligned Bell-Szekeres solution. It is conformally flat everywhere except at the boundaries of the interaction region where there are impulsive gravitational waves that may be considered to be generated by the collision. These are given by  (15.20) According to a theorem of Tariq and Tupper (1974), this new solution must as be the Bertotti-Robinson space-time in a different coordinate system. In fact it can be obtained from the Bell-Szekeres line element (15.7) by the simple rotation  (15.21) Thus, the gravitational field in this case is identical to that of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as may have been expected. In the collision of plane  electromagnetic waves with non-aligned polarization, it must therefore be concluded that the dynamics remains unaltered. It is only the form of the metric in the interaction region that needs to be modified to that given in this section."

NWS NWS-K5C-040 6.55 "Town allergies Professor A Seaton suggests (Points of View, today) that the Rev J L Leckie's view that traffic pollution has caused the rise in the prevalence of asthma in Aberdeen school-children is simplistic. But Mr Leckie must be partly right. Professor Robert Davies, of Bart's, has pointed out that exhaust pollution explains the curious fact that city dwellers these days are more affected by hay fever than those in the country. Both these allergic conditions have the same underlying cause: a dysfunctioning immune system. Therefore all immunosuppressive factors can play a part. These include chemical allergens (exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke among them), food allergens (too often overlooked by asthma specialists), and physical and psychological stress. Their effects are cumulative; there is no single answer in cell-mediated allergy."
