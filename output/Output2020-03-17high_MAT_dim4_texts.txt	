HOC HOC-AG 9.9 " There is nothing personal about the question, it is simply a question of do they agree with government policy and are not being hypocrites. But New Labour's response to anything where they are found out is to browbeat, denigrate or abuse. Like do they all use the NHS, inner city comprehensive schools, public transport, etc.      I can't believe there are so many people saying that it is none of our business if Leo has had the MMR jab or not! This government, which we all voted for, has said you must give your children this jab, but the very people who are telling you this will not tell you if they have done the same. It is starting to sound like the people in government have enough money, paid to them by you and I, to go private for everything, including treatment for their children which they are denying ours! I think people have every right to know exactly how these people lead their lives... if they have something to hide, then they do not deserve to be in power!      Who says MMR is not safe? Yes, there is a rise in autism, which I have never heard the government deny - but there is no scientific link between MMR and autism. The way we all live our lives has changed dramatically and therefore the rise in autism could be related to any number of things. As to public officials releasing details of their children's medical history, shame on you. Somebody's got to look after that child's rights to privacy. I hope Mr Blair continues with his policy! The media and opposition politicians are playing on the fears of scared parents to sell more papers and score cheap political points. I think it's disgusting.      Politicians should practice what they preach. Since there is so little trust in what politicians say these days, the prime minister should at least inform the country whether his youngest son has had the MMR or single vaccinations, particularly since a choice of vaccination type appears not to be available to the average person.      No, no, no! It's none of our business. Leo isn't a member of the government. Medical details should be confidential. I'd like to know what Dr Andrew Wakefield makes of this. I'm sure he wouldn't support this type of disclosure.      Tony Blair and any other MPs have chosen public life, not only for themselves but also their families, as all too often they wheel out the wife and kids. Tony and Cherie, as has been mentioned, have wheeled out the little Blairs too many times to play the privacy card. Tony needs to sort his priorities first - you can't make political capital from your family one day, then shy away the next when something is amiss or not palatable. Tony, be a man, a leader, clear up the mess you've caused, tell us the truth!      Personally I am not interested in whether Tony Blair has given Baby Leo the MMR jab. What I am interested in is if the prime minister has followed his own advice and given one of his offspring the combined MMR jab, and if not why should anyone else follow the official advice?      Personally I think it's disgusting that people are wanting to USE baby Leo as a political football. There are some things that should be respected and family matters are none of the public's business.      Nobody voted for Leo, he holds no official position. There is no reason on earth to somehow expect Tony Blair to start giving out the confidential medical records of his family. What do the media vultures want to see? A repeat of the pathetic exercises of the past where health minister's children have eaten beefburgers on camera to show how safe British Beef is? It seems clear that many media organisations are bent on proving MMR is dangerous (or at least sensationalising it), obviously they are having to spend money to do that, why not put that money into an independent enquiry? They could put their money where their mouths are and actually do something for the public good for once.      We elect MP's to represent our electorates on their ability to bring benefits to the nation through Parliament. I would be the last person to ask an MP and not a medical specialist about MMR.      The Government is pushing the MMR triple vaccine but denies the ever-mounting evidence of autism. In relation to when the vaccines were given singly, autism was very rare. By those standards today, autism is a veritable epidemic. All the evidence of health professionals in the field point towards the MMR vaccine. So is Blair taking the advice of a senior Government health advisor not to give his son MMR and is he taking advice not to tell the public the fears that he maybe holds and cause panic? Either way, he will cause mothers to shun the triple vaccine.      The position taken by government ministers on this beggars belief. I listened to another one this morning on the Today programme ducking the simplest of questions. Can you imagine groups of ordinary parents discussing this matter in a playground refusing to inform each other of their own decisions? No, neither can I. Ministers hiding behind the cloak of ""private matters"" on this issue should be ashamed of themselves.      If I were the Prime Minister, I would choose not to tell others about my family. In my opinion, the public should pay more attention to government policy rather than personal affairs.      Normally children shouldn't be used for political gain (though the Blairs in the past haven't appeared to adhere to this). However, this isn't about Leo per sae, it's about the choice his parents made which could be seriously conflicting with Tony's official line.      It is astounding that people are worried about MMR vaccine, since such a vaccine has been common in the United States for many years with little if any negative side effects. The US is not known for its lax regulatory approval for vaccines. Perhaps this is a political, rather than medical or scientific issue; certain individuals may be using the concerns of parents for personal political gain.      I do not see what all the fuss is about. Prime Minister Blair and his family are afforded the same basic rights as you and I. This means entitlement to privacy under the data protection act. This information is a private matter between doctor and patient and so should be preserved accordingly. If Mr Blair wishes to inform the public, then that is his right but if he does not then equally the principle of non-disclosure should be respected.      Leo's parents will make the decision on whether or not he will take the vaccine. As one of those who is now urging the rest of us to accept MMR then I think we are justified in hearing if Blair practices what he preaches. On the other hand he has shown blind faith in science before - promising nuclear electricity, genetically modified crops and other things I'm not prepared to accept - so I'm not sure we should really trust his judgement anyway.      Surely the public has a right to be spared having to hear every last sordid detail of the private affairs of those in public office.      Under no circumstances should MPs discuss the lives of their children. They are in the public eye but their children did not choose to be so. Everyone has a right to privacy, regardless of the job of the parent. The MPs who have publicly discussed their children should be ashamed of themselves for invading the privacy of those they should be protecting, their own families.      The personal life of an individual should not be brought out in public just because he or she is in politics. As long as they are delivering what they are supposed to, personal life should not come in the way.      It's obvious that Tony Blair can't be trusted on the issue of vaccinations. Whatever the feelings about John Gummer feeding his daughter a burger during the BSE crisis, at least he put his money where his (daughter's) mouth was! Mr Blair was happy enough to flaunt Leo to the cameras and talk about Leo's sleeping patterns and eating habits when everything in the garden was rosy, so it's just too late for him to squawk about his children's health. I just wonder what else the long-suffering public can't trust him on. Putting it mildly, I trust Blair about as much as I'd trust Dracula to behave himself in a blood bank.      Forcing politicians to disclose personal information. Great, what's next - political debates about what brand of condoms MPs use?      Not under normal circumstances but in this case I think Julie Kirkbride's question is justified. Tony Blair has told us that the MMR vaccine is perfectly safe and that we should all give it to our children. How can we trust him if he refuses to confirm that he himself has done what he is telling us to do? It is disingenuous of him to argue that it is a private matter - if he really believes that, then he shouldn't be campaigning for the vaccine in the first place.      As a parent facing the problem of whether to opt (privately) for separate vaccines or the single MMR jab, I am inclined to infer that those politicians and ministers who claim the right of privacy for their children are the ones who have opted for the separate vaccines. The reason being that we are not talking about sensitive information here, unless of course they have not opted for the MMR jab. We are talking about a vaccine.      Should politicians be forced to disclose personal information about themselves? Certainly, if it is relevant. But about their children? I really don't think so.      We have voted for our representatives in parliament for their abilities to run the country. Why do we think we therefore have the right to know everything about how they run their own lives? We voted Blair in to run the country - what makes us think he is qualified to make decisions on complex medical issues. It would be much more revealing to ask the experts in the relevant fields what they would do. In this instance perhaps we should be asking whether the children of the head of the BMA have had these vaccines.      Of what possible benefit can it be to the public at large for politicians to reveal personal information about their families? First of all everyone wants politicians to be more like ""ordinary people"", whatever that means, and then in the next breath suggest that they should tell all and sundry every piece of personal information about their families. Would you reveal every bit of information about your family? Have we really got such pointless and boring lives that we want to concern ourselves with other people's personal details?      Remember John Gummer, the Tory minister, who very publicly fed his young daughter a hamburger in the midst of the BSE scandal. Remember too, the very public pregnancy of Cherie Blair, Leo Blair's subsequent birth and that later the Blairs showed off their new child at a UN conference attended by other world leaders. Politicians do use their own children to make public points and gain popularity. When they don't, it is not because they want defend their children's privacy; more of a case to protect their own political embarrassment.      Politicians should be allowed their 'human right' to privacy just like anyone else. On the other hand, they should be required to disclose as early as ""reasonably possible"" anything about their private lives that may influence their role in elected office, and a failure to disclose this kind of information should result in the most severe financial and possibly other penalties. No more feeble excuses that the planning permission granted to the councillor's partner was completely independent of the fact that the other was an elected official; no more free trips for the kids on a friendly cruise line; no more under-the-table promises of non-exec directorships of telecoms giants after privatisation.      Look at it from the point of view of his family. Why should their personal details be divulged just because of the job their father has? You wouldn't publish the criminal record of all people whose father was a policeman would you?    Tony Blair has a right to keep quiet just as long as he doesn't try to use Leo for political gain in other ways. You have only to think back to the Gummer / burger incident to realise that asking politicians to play politics with their own children is a very bad idea indeed.      What makes anyone think that Tony Blair's Press Secretary (as he is the one who would announce the information) would tell the truth about Leo anyway. The year 2001 has been about 'lies, damned lies and spin' all the way through. I couldn't care less about Leo. What I want is a government that can run things and not destroy everything it touches. (The Dome, Wembley, London's Athletic Stadium, the NHS, the railways, and the farm industry etc.) But the awful truth is that the other two main parties would probably be just as bad.      This all smacks of government opposition by any means possible, because the official one is so useless. To accuse Tony Blair of ""using"" his children when it suits him is just disingenuous; he simply does what he can to balance the demands of the media with his natural instincts as a proud and protective father. The irony is that the nature of this ""opposition"" is such that it would suit many to disbelieve government ministers whatever they said about MMR and their children. As somebody else has already said, it would be far more interesting to know what the scientists are doing where their children are concerned.      I agree that privacy and free choice should be respected, BUT ... hundreds of alleged 'autism from MMR' cases have to come to light, and given that this is such an important issue for those involved, if the PM's son did not receive these jabs (all at once) due to the PM knowing something that we don't - or being advised against it, then he must tell the UK. It is totally hypocritical and almost 'dictatorial' to urge the population to do one thing, then do something totally different based on what some argue to be firm evidence. C'mon Tony, first the Dome, now this ... don't you like the British public??      The fact is that by standing up for an abstract principle ministers have blown a hole in an important piece of public health policy. Parents who are undecided will take silence to mean the vaccine is dangerous, and won't give their babies the jab. Some of those babies will suffer serious damage by being unprotected, bringing great misery on their families. Is the abstract notion of a ""right to privacy"" more important than a baby's health?      If personal information regards whether a certain politician, his partner or children have financial interests in various private companies, they should be forced to disclose it - no matter how big or small the interest. But when it comes to medical matters it's ridiculous to say that the public have a right to know. It might sound innocent enough to demand to know whether Leo Blair has been given a controversial vaccine, but it would set a bad precedent. What happens when a PM's child is diagnosed with STDs or other ""shameful"" diseases?      Martin - please point us to the evidence that the combined MMR jab is not safe. Studies have shown this not to be true.      Of course he should disclose what he does if he's trying to say what we should do.... don't good leaders lead by example ?      I think that Martin, UK, is spreading a great misconception that the MMR vaccine is unsafe. As far as I'm aware, most scientifically rigorous studies have shown that there is no direct link between MMR and autism - with the studies claiming that there is some correlation now widely discredited. As with all medical studies of this nature, where the mechanism that causes autism (even if such a thing exists) is not understood, a heavy reliance is placed on statistics which then rely on some accompanying interpretation. This is where all the problems begin. Is there a real risk of a child developing autism after an MMR injection? Probably not - as the studies suggest. Is there a known and real risk of a child developing a life-threatening illness from not receiving MMR? Certainly yes.      If it is involved with policy, yes. If Tony Blair goes around saying the MMR jab is perfectly safe, but won't let his son have it, then he's a great big hypocrite.      For once I am on the side of Mr Blair. The private medical details of any child should never be a matter for the public no matter who the parents are.      Leo wasn't born to be used as a political football. Politicians on both sides of the house should be able to make their point without having to sink as low as using children to make their opinion or question heard.      Leo Blair was not elected to public office. What right has anyone other than his parents to know his medical details? None, nor does the public or parliament have the right to know the prime minister's medical details. They are confidential.      It's not a case of being forced to disclose information. With this issue, it's a question of leadership by example. If the government wants to promote the MMR vaccine then it should do everything in its power to push it, which includes the prime minister assuring us that his child had had the vaccine. Of course, if Leo hasn't had it, then we have to ask why not? If the prime minister has seen fit not to allow his son to have it then surely we should all have grave doubts about whether any child should have it. Go on Tony, show us the way.      They should be forced to disclose the personal details of their families. However they should perhaps recognise that such openness will result in positive public sentiment towards them.      To be honest I personally am not interested in whether Leo Blair has been given the vaccine or not. What I am interested in is receiving the correct information about the subject to make my own decision on what is and isn't safe.      We all know that the combined MMR jab is not safe - it is purely for financial and administrative reasons why it is forced upon us. I say yes - name and shame the government hypocrites. Force them to declare personal interests where it conflicts with government policy.    "
HOC HOC-BC 9.56 " The interests of Turkey and Greece on the island can easily be justified. But the interference of other nations and the EU is not good for either party. Forcing them to negotiate is OK but preferring one side over the other does not help at all.      I was born in 1978, 4 years after the invasion. I've been studying the history and facts about Cyprus for a long time now and have tried to write them here as objectively as possible but found out it takes up too much space. The extremists from both the Greek and Turkish sides are largely responsible for this situation as were the British authorities in the 1950s who used a policy of divide and rule. Generally, it's a world of foreign interests. I can't visit any other country by land means, so why should I be restricted in my own?      The main problem in Cyprus has been, and still is, foreign interests. There will never be a fair and long lasting solution to the problems there until outside powers and their local associates stop meddling around. A just solution should guarantee EU rights and obligations for all citizens including the freedom of movement, ownership and settlement and not create new geographic and power sharing divisions that serve nobody but outsiders.      The UN should broker an agreement that splits the island between Greece and Turkey and solve this dispute once and for all.      Why should Turkey suddenly want to allow 200,000 refugees back to their homes? As long as it remains a dependant US ally, they don't have to respect anybody's human rights. The west needs to open its eyes - Turkey will never give any human rights as long as we choose to appease its actions for the sake of the countries geo-political importance.      It appears Greece has the weaker stand on thwarting the EU's efforts to enlarge their membership. Turkey's threat of annexing northern Cyprus will ignite another everlasting conflict between Greece and Turkey. Peace is under the EU's feet. And the people of Cyprus have an obvious choice.      How sensible of Turkey to make a difficult situation even worse by their threats. And this from a country that wants to join the EU itself... what's even odder is that it's not even a European nation.      I have had the privilege of visiting both halves of Cyprus and also crossed the UN buffer zone in Nicosi. Having spoken to people of both sides, they all seem to be in agreement that it was the other's fault. Through reading the history it seems as if Cyprus' problem had more to do with meddling from Athens and Ankara than Cypriots themselves.      Luckily most people seemed to want a settlement of some sorts although this will be tricky because Greek Cypriot people forced out of their homes by Turks want to go home. They won't accept a loose federation that disallows this but of course you could simply force a deal on the people in which both halves would have an equal state inside the federation using the same currency. The pot of gold that awaits Cyprus if it can sort this mess out and get in the EU is enormous. Turkey would probably accept such a deal because it would mean that current EU members would now have to take Turkey's application to join the EU seriously. The problem then lies with Greece because they really want to get a Cyprus settlement that annoys Turkey and at the same time gives Greece (and other EU anti-Turkey members) a good reason never to allow Turkey to join the EU which of course would be very bad!      I believe that a unified federal state applying strong EU principles for the protection of the individuality of the two ethnic groups as well as some geographic definition for the two federal areas will be a good way to start a new phase of trust-building and a new reality on the island. Then we need time. Time is the essence of building confidence based on economic prosperity fairly distributed between the two ethnic groups.     It's exactly the same situation as Palestine and Northern Ireland. Two masses cannot occupy the same space at the same time but both sides are too proud to give in.      If the two sides are at all interested in progress, then let the border become a normal land border with no more than the usual checkpoints and allow free mixing of the people from either side as well as migration for those who want it. If the people do this for a few years and realise they can get along then it will be time to talk about re-unification but to attempt to do so while such hostility and ignorance exists between them is just inviting violence.      Let the Cypriots have a national referendum on their own organised by the UN. Let them decide for themselves what direction to take and tell Greece and Turkey to stand back and let the Cypriots decide for themselves. If they cannot decide then let the island be separated and live in peace.      I think there's a way to talk around the problem, but I'll be dashed if I can see it.      Being a 28-year-old Greek I believe that I represent a generation that was brought up with a total apathy towards politics. Cyprus was and still is a very delicate matter that affects both the diplomatic but also the personal relations of people living on both sides. One could argue that Cyprus is just one of the problems that both Greece and Turkey have had to come to terms with. I sincerely believe that other countries that keep playing a diplomatic role in the region are the only ones who will really benefit of the continuation of the current situation. If Greece and Turkey can cooperate without having to be dictated in their policies by other countries then everything would be totally different. But I guess that applies for most countries in the world.      In 1974, Turkey gave human rights to the people of what is now the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. If it hadn't been for the Turkish army occupying the North, then the Greek Cypriots would have continued with their aggressive policy of occupation. Reuniting the island under the Greek Cypriot proposals would allow them to continue on their road to the unification of Cyprus with Greece. You might say I'm living in the past, but the hatred is still evident on both sides, and I seriously don't think you could expect these people to live in harmony after reunification.       There are two independent nations represented on that island. The situation is no different to Bosnia splitting from Yugoslavia. People should stop blaming Turkey. After all, Turkey is not the one that staged a military coup back in 1974. People should learn to deal with the facts. "
HOC HOC-BD 9.6 " I think that the Japanese royal family should make their own decision. They can leave the whole thing behind them or make their first child the heir to the throne. Too much trouble has been made over the centuries with extended families fighting for power, just because there was no male heir. A woman is more than capable of ruling a country, as we can see from history.      If I were Japanese then I would say yes, however I'm not so it's none of my business. Just because we think it is right and proper doesn't make it any of our business what happens in Japan. Cultural imperialism is very dated since September 11th - and that is what this talking point is.      Most of us are just happy to see a new baby in the Imperial family and don't really care whether if it is a girl or boy honestly. Japan has had eight empresses serving ten periods if I remember correctly. So there is not so much heated debate here in Japan right now. People say let's not spoil this great moment in this family with political debates right now, but we will just do the right thing when things are ready. That's also Prime minister Koizumi implied too.     For the time being, I just hope the Princess and the Prince enjoy what all the parents enjoy - celebrating the birth of new life.      Time has come for Japan to change its rusty constitution. And change, it must. It is not gender's dictation on rule but simply how one is trained in life to accomplish a task or task(s).      The Crown Princess of Sweden has a younger brother, yet no one makes a fuss about this factoid.      They should do whatever they themselves feel is the best way of securing the future of the Imperial family. That might be to change the constitution, or maybe not. I trust the judgement of a household that has survived so long.      It would have mattered much more were women allowed succession in times when the post of emperor had real power. Giving women the right of succession now that the monarch is little more than an ornament may even be counter-productive for the cause of gender equality.      Anyone either male, female, colour of skin is immaterial. If one has the capability to rule or to be in power provided they can do it with peace then they are they leader and others people in and out of the nation should respect they capability.      Most Japanese fall asleep at the mention of the Imperial family, a remote and increasingly ceremonial institution. Debating a question like this is like asking whether the Lord Mayor of London should have two feathers in his hat or three. It is not as if the girl will necessarily have a worse life for not becoming Emperor.      Remember the importance in Japanese culture of history and tradition as the stabilising force behind a fast-moving society. Some things which are plainly obvious to us take generations to change within these circles and are often fraught with difficulty. Be sympathetic and encouraging to the Japanese rather than dismissive!      Of course they should change their constitution. Like all sensible nations dedicated to the ideals of democracy they should remove the monarchy altogether and create a democratically elected head of state.     This is a contentious issue: currently women's rights are a means of demonising entire countries. Japan had female rulers in the past, and much like the British monarchy, currently there is no power associated with it's monarchs. When the Queen is no longer the Queen, and if a man takes her place is that a regression to a less evolved state of political thinking. I don't think so. And to be frank I find other political developments in the world worry me a lot more than this one.      Why not? We had several female emperors before the end of the19th century. However, they had to be virgins as this was the social norm of the time. However, in modern society such an idea does not make sense. I will definitely support changing the Japanese constitution and a possible female emperor should be allowed to get married.      I think Japan must change the constitution because we are in the 21st century and women should have the same rights as men.      The fact that the imperial family is the world's oldest ruling line suggests that the concept works and that perhaps other societies should try to copy their way of life rather than attempt to influence change.      Of course Japan should change its constitution. Cultures are not frozen in time. They evolve and adapt. They always have done - that's what keeps them vibrant. A culture that tries to remain the same for all time is a dead one.      In general I don't really like the idea of a monarchy anywhere. But if there has to be one let the first-born child, no matter whether it's a boy or a girl, inherit the throne.      I do find this sort of patriarchy completely unjustifiable and misogynistic. What exactly are the arguments for passing power down the male line? That women couldn't lead a country at war (say that to Elizabeth I)? That women can't command respect (say that to Victoria)? Or that women can't be ruthless (say that to Thatcher)? When are people going to learn that leadership skills are based on personality not gender?      This reminds me of the 'Should Australia become a republic?' debate. Back then, I said that this was nothing to do with anyone outside of Australia and was a question that only the Australian people could answer.      So now I will give a similar answer - this is a question that only Japan can answer and that has nothing to do with the rest of us.      In response to Graham from London I would pose this question: fundamentally speaking, is there any difference between outsiders making an argument that Afghan women should be given the right to attend school and making one that Japanese women should have rights to the throne?      Let us not pretend that the Japanese constitution has never changed before. Their government structure has undergone two dramatic changes in the last 150 years: the Meiji Constitution, following 1868, and the post-WWII constitution. It is possible to change the constitution and maintain the continuity of the imperial line.      The Japanese royal family claim descent through continuous line for thousands of years. The new princess follows that line and, whilst I agree that it is for Japan to decided and not anyone else, surely this must play an important factor. Despite one or two comments above, I believe that the imperial family is an important part of Japanese life and should continue.      Haven't Western nations interfered enough in the internal affairs of other countries? When will we ever learn? If the Japanese people want to see the Constitution of their country changed it's their decision. We don't have electoral rights there, we shouldn't be going round assuming what's good and what's not for every other country on the planet!      Britain will shortly celebrate (I hope) a Golden Jubilee. With a record such as that as a model, I see no reason why the Japanese cannot see the benefits of a female sovereign.      I applaud the idea. Japan is a notoriously sexist society. I think a change in the law to allow female monarchs would be a powerful symbol, and greatly advance the status of Japanese women in all spheres of life. It might even help change attitudes in other countries.      It's ironic when you consider that the Emperors claim to have received their mandate from a Goddess in the first place.       So much of Japanese society is unfair to women and the banning of women from inheriting the thrown is no different. I believe it would be more meaningful if Japan spent more effort ridding itself of its misogynistic ways...undoubtedly the country would benefit greatly. "
HOC HOC-BW 9.53 " In my opinion, the bank should take this ideal opportunity to claim free advertising. I'm sure they would be happy to pay a top marketing company a similar price for a really effective ad campaign and who could refuse to join a bank that is so generous? A tongue-in-cheek advertisement relating to the incident could increase their business greatly and I'm sure Mr Hickey, if allowed to keep the money, would be happy to give them a glowing reference!      We seem to be missing the point here. If the above story is complete, I suspect Mr Hickey is not keeping hold of the cash because he believes he is entitled to do so, but rather because he quite rightly feels aggrieved at being clapped in irons for honestly reporting the mistake in the first place. Surely the Spanish police only arrested him at the behest of the bank, why else would they care? Yes, he should give the cash back, but he should receive substantial compensation for wrongful arrest and detention. The debate should not be anything to do with the actual accounting error, but rather Mr Hickey's treatment.      Where money is concerned honesty is always best. When my bank made an error I told them straight away. Once I found a wallet stuffed with money, I took it to the police station and later an old gent called at my house and gave me a reward.      In my opinion, the fact that the bank had the audacity to put at the bottom of the transaction slip that it was not responsible for any errors makes the money his. That statement is to protect themselves. If the error had been in their favour and he had tried to get recompense he would have no chance. The bank should try to recover the money from the person who made the mistake.      Having had a bank pay someone elses wages into my account whilst an impoverished student, I can understand the blunder. However, the thought of keeping the money never crossed my mind! Mr. Hickey would have soon complained if the mistake was to his detriment!      It is undeniable that the money was put in the bank as the result of a request for an exchange transaction. Therefore there is a contract to supply Mr Hickey with the amount exchanged at whatever rate was agreed at the time of the transaction. If Mr hickey agreed to receive some money at a given rate then that is the only money the bank has a duty to supply him with. Having made the error and pointed it out to Mr Hickey the bank must then enter into a new arrangement with Mr hickey to cover the return of their money. Mr Hickey would of course be perfectly entitled to charge them any amount he deems reasonable for his entire costs and time spent sorting out their mess. I don't know what Mr Hickey's hourly rate is, lawyers can charge hundreds of pounds per hour, but his time spent under arrest and in court will only increase the charges to the bank.      If I make a MISTAKE in my budgets for the month and go overdrawn by accident, some might say by MISTAKE, the bank are very keen to jump on me and charge #25 just for a letter telling me this. Am I able to have them arrested? No. This bank has also made a ""MISTAKE."" They should learn their lesson by it (as should the entire banking industry) and live with the consequences. After all, we all have to.      I've had dealings with UK banks when they have made mistakes against me. Even when I've proved to them with receipts etc, they still refused to give me back money that was mine (which they had removed in error from my account). I had to take them to the ombudsmen before getting the money back. I say good on Mr Hickey for standing his ground. At the very least if it ends up going against him, they should compensate for his arrest since it was their fault in the first place. He should also keep any interest to (have you EVER tried obtaining lost interest from a bank after they have made a mistake).      I think that he should return the money as it doesn't belong to him. However, the bank concerned should also give him a good-will payment as its own terms stated that it wasn't responsible for any mistakes.      I have had a similar experience, but involving the smaller some of around #10,000. It occurred when transferring funds from my account in Switzerland to my private account in Spain. I asked the bank to transfer Pts 30,000 but they transferred SFr. 30,000. I discovered the mistake when going to make a withdrawal from the Swiss account and was told that I was SFr. 29,000 in deficit. The bank realised the mistake and asked me if I would please return the money, which of course I did, as should Mr Hickey.      Keep it!! They have said that they cannot be held responsible for errors made by the bank. I know someone who paid a bill to the bank on time, only to receive a letter the following week saying he had not paid and that the bank would charge him #25 for the error. He wrote a letter back, saying that if they check their records they will see that he has paid and that he charged them #25. The error was corrected and he did receive #25!      Of course the monies should be returned as it was transferred in error. Barclays once remitted over 400,000 into my account and were quick to take it back. They were right to do so however wonderful on the bank statement!      I recently received #1,300 into my bank account and having just started a new job presumed it was my first month's wages due at around the same time. I found it puzzling that I had not received a payslip however and found out that the money had in fact been paid in by another company. I have no idea who they are and why they paid me the money, I have contacted my bank to try and find out where the money has come from but after a 5 day wait while they went through their retrieval system, they tell me they can't reveal any details because of the Data Protection Act.      I am prepared to give the money back when asked but until then, it will stay in a savings account garnering interest. But I like the idea of Mr Hickey charging the bank an administrative charge - it seems the only way he can get something out of the whole fiasco.      Not only would I give money back that wasn't mine, I have. I got more cash out of a cash machine than I asked for or was on my receipt. The only thing to do was to call the bank to explain what happened, and have them deduct it from my account. The money was not mine, and I could not keep it. It doesn't matter what the amount, the principle is the same. Stealing is wrong. I do think that honesty should be rewarded, but not necessarily monetarily. A letter of gratitude is enough. In this world, trust is all we really have with each other in the end. Let's keep that trust, and the hope that comes with it, alive!      Bank error in your favour - so goes the monopoly chance card. Good luck to Mr Hickey. Has everyone seen the charges banks levy, like charging customers for using a competitor's cash machine. They can afford this loss.      Give it back? No Way. Only when ""I made a mistake"" becomes an acceptable excuse for being overdrawn, or not paying your credit card bill, should he give it back. Legally, if his receipt says the bank is not responsible for any errors, then tough. I feel for the person who made the mistake, but rules are rules, moral or not.      It should be remembered that an individual made a mistake, an administrative error. It happens. The money should be returned.      Having been the victim of a well-known bank's errors many times in the past, and having been charged for their mistakes, which took a long time to rectify, I'd say good luck, quickly transfer the money to another account, and enjoy it.      If the bank were to have deducted money from his account by mistake Mr Hickey would have demanded it back plus compensation. So he should repay the bank the money back less 1 percent.      A similar situation happened to me when I was in Germany. I was given 300 pounds worth of DM when I only handed in 150 pounds worth (not quite a quarter of a million). Once I realised my mistake I did bring the money back. However, it was touch and go, I was very tempted to spend it. But I think the right thing was to give it back.      He should return the money, of course. But he should also retain a percentage, say 10%, for the emotional stress involved in being arrested for someone else's mistake.      I think this man will eventually be forced to give up the cash, after all the laws are there to protect the banks. I would definitely return the cash to its rightful owner, but much like this guy is doing I'd make them jump through hoops first and then say pretty pleeeease.      Do the right thing - give the money back      This guy needs a lawyer as Spanish law may dictate what happens. A foreign country (Ireland) made the error and what recourse they might have in Spain is really the question.     I think the very fact that there is even a debate on the subject says a lot about morals in today's society. There is no debate - he came by the money in error, has seen a chance to profit at someone else's cost and is now using the media to try and engender support for his immoral stance. Incompetence and over-reaction do not justify dishonesty.      The only time I get to keep the money when the bank makes an error in my favour is when I play Monopoly. In real life it has never happened to me but if it did I am sure that I would have to pay it back. After all it isn't my money.      Whilst his arrest by the Spanish police appears to be over the top considering he didn't know about the situation then (or so he says), he is well aware now that the money is not his, and is only there as a result of an honest error. He should give back the money that isn't his to the bank, although he should be allowed to keep the interest on the money. He would not feel the same way if the error went the other way, would he?      Years ago my bank credited my account with #1,399 which I immediately realised was a bank error, caused by accidentally shifting a decimal point 2 places to the right. I pointed out the mistake three times to the bank: once by phone, once in person, and once in writing. Amazingly, the bank resolutely refused to admit it had made a mistake and after waiting six months for the bank staff to recognise their error and adjust my balance, I resolved the impasse by spending the money. Not surprisingly, the bank has long since closed down.      Mr. Hickey's situation is different. The bank and Mr. Hickey both know a genuine mistake has been made and the bank has asked Mr. Hickey to return its misdirected funds. The rule of the jungle does not apply and Mr. Hickey is likely to find himself in deep trouble if he spends the money. Given the sum of money involved, an elegant - albeit naughty - solution might be for Mr. Hickey to leave the bank's money untouched in a deposit account and enjoy spending the not inconsiderable interest!      I remember a case of many years ago where a man received #10,000 into his current account by mistake. Despite his knowing that it was not his money he immediately withdrew it and spent it. He was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty of stealing by finding. Quite right too in my opinion. The man was a thief.      Having been arrested, handcuffed and then released effectively on bail for somebody else's mistake, I would return to the bank not one penny until the bank started talking about compensation.      Having borne the brunt of banking errors to my detriment in the past, would I give it back? Not a chance! I hope that the Irish guy enjoys the sun and sand of Spain on his new-found windfall - I most certainly would!      Where has this man lost his conscience? Probably, no court can help in this situation, as legally, if confirmed by appropriate banking documents, he seems to be right to hold the money with him. This is only a question of morale, which is absent in this case.      Perhaps errors such as these will make banks be less heavy-handed with their own petty 'administrative' charges, and less prone to mistakes. God knows the number of times the two banks I'm with have made silly mistakes that have cost me time (and sometimes money). I think the gentleman in question is entitled to a percentage of the money. He should refer to it as administrative charges, and explain to the bank that it's just 'company policy'.      Businesses like to make the rules to which customers must adhere, but feel they only apply if the result is in their favour. If, as I believe Mr Hickey claims, the agreement says that the bank is not responsible for errors and they cannot be corrected at a later time, the bank should abide by their own terms of business.      Of course he should repay it - it isn't his, the bank has made it clear that the error occurred and keeping the money is tantamount to theft.     If he is correct that the bank transaction had a disclaimer saying that they were not responsible for errors then I think it sounds like the bank has no come back against him. After all those disclaimers are there to cover the banks when they make mistakes in their favour so it should stand for cases when the banks make mistakes in the customers favour.      Shame on Mr Hickey. Where does he think the money to pay for his greed would have to come from, and does he have any feeling for the poor bank employee who made an honest mistake?      Ludicrous man. So if I order a computer, for example, and it gets delivered to my next door neighbour by mistake, is he entitled to think it's his? Bank errors work both ways of course. Presumably the bank could accidentally transfer money out of his account by mistake if he doesn't cough up.      Rob, UK - actually under Britsh law if you order goods and they are delivered to the wrong person, that person is not legally required to return them.      We're all human, we make mistakes and bank personnel are no different. They should be less prone to error than most but it's almost impossible to have 100% perfection when handling large volumes of transactions in multiple currencies. This greedy man deserves to be forced to pay back every penny.      I presume that if his account had been debited by that amount then he would be happy to accept that mistake?      I sympathise with him but holding on to what you know isn't yours is dishonest. If the error had put the bank in possession of his money or goods he'd be the first to complain.      When I opened my old account they were supposed to give me a #50 sweetener. They accidentally gave me #100. I didn't complain and #50 extra was hardly going to ruin them. After a year or so another bank offered me a better deal so I switched. They promised me a #60 sweetner. I never got it. When I complained I was told that they had given customers who hadn't yet received their money till the end of last year to ask where it had got to and those that didn't ask by the deadline forfeited their right to it. Unfortunately, the bank 'forgot' to let me know about this so-called deadline. Perhaps it was some bizarre justice, making right the mistake from before and punishing me by an extra tenner for not pointing out the mistake the other bank had made. I say to Mr Hickey: keep that cash at your peril, because there's obviously a higher power out there and he's a banker!      A couple of years ago whilst making some changes to one of my Direct Debits my bank somehow managed to change the status of my account to the effect that I had died. They then informed everybody who I had dealings with via the bank of my demise. This even got as far as our postman who knocked on the door to express his commiserations with my wife. I even had letters from BT addressed to the executors of my estate. When I pointed out to the bank that I was still alive we all had a jolly good laugh about it and they apologised profusely.      However, when it came to sorting out the account not only did they refuse to inform all those parties that it had told I was dead but informed me that it was my responsibility to ensure that my account details were correct. The problem seemed to snowball from then on and I even had a letter from them implying that I had faked my own death in order not to repay my bank loan. It was only through the honesty of the bank employee who made the original error that I was able, eventually, to sort it all out. Would I give back the money? Probably, but I'd make them sweat for it. Oh, the honest bank employee, what happened to her? made redundant two months later.      I would be very tempted to tell him to keep the money but feel the right solution is for the bank to offer him compensation for their mistake and for all his inconvenience. Banks are rather a law unto themselves until they are the aggrieved party.       The assertion that Mr Hickey has made of ""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" is wholly unacceptable. If the error caused him to suffer genuine inconvenience or loss then of course he would be entitled to a claim for compensation but to knowingly benefit from a mistake like this is totally dishonest. No doubt he would complain if every bank refused his custom just in case they made a similar error! "
HOC HOC-CX 9.65 " I'm appalled at what I've read on this page. The vast majority seem to believe that Martin did nothing wrong - but he killed another person. Of course we all want to defend ourselves against burglars but that does not (and must not) give us the right to take another life.     It is so sad how easily the public are fooled. He had a loaded shotgun and deliberately killed the youth who so misguidedly entered his property. The Martins of this world will always get the public sympathy as the majority look at the shallow facts rather than the deep ones. Don't be fooled. Martin has got away with murder. The police clearly proved Martin laid in wait and gunned down the intruder in the back.      If someone breaks into your home and you are in mortal fear for your life, then of course you should be allowed to defend yourself. Even if the courts say otherwise, it would be best to defend yourself. Better 5 years in prison then 6 feet under the ground!      The Martin case delivers an interesting perspective on the British viewpoint of justice. Justice takes place in the courts and - in Martin's case - justice was done first time around. Public opinion has wrongly portrayed Martin as the victim. This is not the case. Martin took justice into his own hands and should serve the consequences. It is simply absurd for certain sectors of the community to advocate a society in which burglars 'get what they deserve' in a kind of rough justice dealt out by the 'people'. Judgements such as this, which seek to legitimise such behaviour, are fundamentally wrong for the safety and morality of our society.      This man should be released! I have been burgled at least 14 times, squatted in, had my house set on fire, been verbally abused and threatened. No funds are available to make my home more secure; there's no counselling; no insurance means we live in a shell. I am frightened every time I walk out the door, and have had a nervous breakdown. It is time our society gave these brats what they deserve.      I have slept on the sofa with an axe, they were coming in so often! I am not living in a council estate where there is an almost expected turnover of crime, but in a nice middle class area. No magistrate should put these people first. Make them pay back everything, and more! Believe it or not, I have worked with young people, and have loved every minute, but I now hate this attitude that is permeating our society where parents condone their offspring's misbehaviour. My kids grew up in dire circumstances, but I taught them right from wrong!      If people could see the inside of our home, they might feel the same. As it is, it has been three years since I let anyone in, I am so ashamed.      To repeatedly be the victim of burglary must be a terrible experience - but no one 'defends their property' with an unlicenced pump action shotgun and the inclination to use it. Shooting a child burglar in the back as he runs away is not defence but punishment. And is Tony Martin morally opposed to window locks and burglar alarms, I wonder?      Poor Mr Martin. What a pity he doesn't live here in the USA. On a self-defence training class I attended at the local Sheriff's department, I was told categorically to kill an intruder, INSIDE my house, after warning that I had a loaded gun ready and would use it to defend myself. No one knows how fearful Tony Martin was for his safety. Did he have to be beaten as well as robbed, before taking action? The police, in both countries, are for the most part unable and unwilling to control or catch criminals. Therefore, you have to be prepared to protect yourself and your property.      The young man who was killed was breaking the law the moment he entered Mr Martin's house. HE chose to break the law, Mr Martin was simply protecting himself and his property. What a pity the law is such an ass that it persists in defending those who perpetrate crimes, rather than the victims seeking to save themselves.      It still does not give him the right to shoot someone to kill. How about if the police were armed against burglars, and shot someone when trying to apprehend. Would this then be OK - by the sound of most of your letters, it would be. Shoe on the other foot please!      No matter which way you look at it, Tony Martin shot and killed someone, for which he should be punished. The only injustice in this case is the distorted scale of punishment in this country. What happened to ""an eye for an eye""?      As far as I am aware, the law states that it is illegal to kill. I have never read a clause that excludes burglars. It is the job of the police to find and arrest the felons and of the courts to convict. That is why we have laws, otherwise it's gung-ho all the way.      Tony Martin should be released now, and compensated for his time in prison. Many people have commented how sad it was that a young life was lost in this tragic case, but perhaps we should ask how much misery and suffering of innocent people has been averted by ending this criminal's career. Not to mention the saving to the taxpayer in his rehabilitation had he been caught. The intruders got what they deserved. Mr Martin's unjust imprisonment sends out the wrong signals to criminals - what happened to being ""Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime""?      He should have served one year in prison for NOT killing both of them.      What if the boy that Martin killed had been 15 years old, or even younger? Would people then be so in favour of shooting anyone who enters a house uninvited?      Those two men broke into his house knowing that he was at home. Did they expect him to offer them a cup of tea and some cake when he found them? They were old enough to know that what they were doing was wrong and so old enough to pay the price. If Mr Martin was paranoid, well, looks like he had good reason to be. Two against one. In his position I would have done the same thing.      Murder is the right verdict. With premeditation. Although I agree with the use of reasonable force, that does not involve firearms or knifes. If he had a gun, it was probably with the intention of using it against intruders. If it is the case, it is indeed premeditation.      We, here in America, take a different point of view than does the British judiciary. If a person invades another's home for whatever purpose, then we accept that we have the right to defend ourselves and our property, even if that means killing the intruder. I accept this. Unfortunately I believe that Britons are confused about this issue, preferring to give the benefit of the doubt to the criminals even to the extent of providing a nurturing response to them.      The soaring rate of crime and the apparent lawless culture endemic in Britain today call for a different response to what may have been the norm twenty or even ten years ago. Britain needs to accept the criminal climate has changed, probably forever. Until Britain takes a much firmer attitude in its prosecution of crime - accepting it for what it is ie an attack against society - then I believe we will see more episodes like Mr Martin's.      I'm in complete agreement with many of the people on this page - it is vital that we should be able to defend ourselves and our property if the situation requires it. One thought on this case though - what would have happened if somebody had innocently called upon Mr Martin for directions, or to tried to use a phone? Would they have met the same fate as Fred Barras?      We have followed the Tony Martin case with growing interest and horror at the way Mr Martin has been treated. We are both teachers of many years experience and we think that the way things have gone in this case are a frightening illustration of the way law and order have broken down. Of course, we are aware that a young man lost his life. Nevertheless, Mr Martin was alone in a remote house and the police were not easily accessible. He had a right to defend his property and the burglars had no right to be there. They were breaking the law and intimidating an innocent homeowner.      We can never know what he felt when being burgled, but since those men should never have been there in the first place I feel that we have to give Martin the benefit of the doubt that it was not murder.      Presumably the law would have been more sympathetic if he had been robbed or killed. Has the world gone mad? Are we so politically correct that the innocent can't upset the guilty? Recently we have read that an elderly lady was made to remove barbed wire from her fencing in case a potential burglar hurt himself. We should be like the Americans who allow a homeowner to defend his or her own property. Bring back discipline and social order and allow Tony Martin to go free.      I have read here that the law is biased in favour of the criminal. Martin was convicted of murder, later reduced to manslaughter. This makes him, er, a criminal.      Criminals who break into your house should have no right whatsoever. This case just offers proof that criminals will be protected at the cost of the victim. Tony Martin should never have gone to jail. This is just absurd. Next we'll probably have health benefits for thieves.      Whatever the case with Mr Martin's sentencing, I'd bet that some young criminals are now just slightly less keen on breaking and entering than they used to be.      Today's verdict is a joke and just another case of the system bowing to people power rather than the true events. Tony Martin should not have his sentence reduced to manslaughter. If you wave a loaded gun at someone then you should accept the consequences if they are injured or killed. He had no right to play God and decide if another human being should live or die.      Being in the unfortunate position of having had my own house burgled just last night, I fully sympathise with those who act to defend their property. However any such action has to be measured, appropriate and reasonable - none of which apply to a pump action shotgun! The court of appeal obviously had good evidence presented to it today as to the psychiatric condition of Mr Martin and it is for this reason his sentence was reduced. It saddens me that so many of the comments here suggest that people are seeing it as an endorsement of illegal vigilante behaviour.      Burglars do more than steal your property, they steal your feeling of safety and security in your own home and cause fear long after the event. Tony Martin only did what the State is failing to do - protected himself by whatever means were available. He should be released now.      The law at present favours the criminal in cases of burglary. Numerous cases have been seen where burglars injured by the householder have successfully sued for damages. The law should be changed so that a person who is within the perimeter of someone's home should be subject to the same law as reasonable defence, as in assault cases. If someone has entered the building then the person has done so at their own risk and they must accept the consequences with no civil liability. Killing someone is not an option but, so long as a householder can demonstrate reasonable justification for any action taken, then the criminal law should not apply. Using a firearm in any instance is not justified and cannot be defended.      Let's face it, this whole situation was caused by two thieves who only took from society and caused distress, upset and grief. Mr Martin should be treated as a hero for protecting society from these people where our 'justice' system fails to protect us. Release Mr Martin immediately.      I'm absolutely incredulous reading the responses on this forum. Firstly the verdict has been changed to manslaughter because Tony Martin is considered to have a mental disorder, not because there has been any change on the idea of reasonable force. Secondly Tony Martin was not defending himself because he wasn't being attacked. If he was, he couldn't have shot the young lad in the back. Finally, I wasn't aware that it had become acceptable in our society to kill someone as punishment for a crime. He murdered that boy, the only reason that the verdict has been changed is because of his mental disorder. What does that make all the people on here who think he did the right thing?      I agree Tony Martin should be released from prison and taken to either Broadmoor or Ashworth hospital until he has been assessed and deemed not to be a danger to society and his personality disorder treated. He owned an illegal pump action shotgun and had gun ownership licenses revoked in the past. As one commentator has said already; what if it was a person asking for directions or wanted to use a phone because their car had broken down?     If you think that the justice system in this country is inadequate then do something about it. Don't just take the law into your own hands.      This man should never have been convicted in the first place. This country has lost all sense of right and wrong. We spend far too much time thinking about criminals' rights, totally forgetting the victims.      Half a victory for common sense. A half-hearted step in the right direction. Consider for a moment if the persons involved swapped places. The 16 year-old, under the influence of drugs and alcohol would certainly not have been convicted of murder. His older colleague in crime would not have been convicted of murder. Most likely neither would have been convicted of manslaughter, nor of causing him serious injury. There are enough precedents.      Before you can claim self-defence (unless you are a burglar) you have to make steps to escape. But in your own home, where can you go, where can you retreat? Do you abandon your home to any violent thugs? Is this the message the Courts wish to send out? Who are these pompous individuals who sit in judgement, whose only experience of violence and burglary is in the 'civilised atmosphere' of a courtroom safe from any violence, threat of violence or intimidation of any sort? Not only that, but the defendants are on their best behaviour. Tony Martin should be, and always should have been a free man.      You are all naming Martin as the 'victim' - but he was the one who took a human life! To suggest that the punishment for breaking and entering should be death is rather hysterical. I thought that the original verdict of murder was correct - after all the definition of manslaughter is killing without intent, and blasting a boy with a shotgun is hardly that.      I think the courts have done the right thing to lower the charge to manslaughter, but they should have released him on a time served basis. If you can't protect yourself / property then it is no use waiting on the police in a rural area. I have known of people who have been burgled and the police don't turn up until 24 hours after the event (in an urban area). I don't blame the police as they are under pressure from government targets, but if you can't protect yourself in your own home, where can you protect yourself. This country is full of don'ts, when will the government target socially unacceptable behaviour, so that we don't have to take drastic action to protect ourselves?      No justice has not been served. Tony Martin should never have been convicted. No longer is an Englishman's home his castle. The judge trying the original case said, ""this sends out a powerful message to would be burglars"". The judge was not telling the truth, it sends out a message that the State is not on the side of honest people. This case was a burglar's charter.      Wading through the comments of other correspondents, I think I only detected one dissenting voice against an overwhelming tide of outrage that this guy should have been charged, let alone locked up, in the first place. Mr Martin may be slightly mad, but that doesn't make him bad and he was only dangerous to know if you happened to be a burglar. The law is an ass, it needs to get some perspective, and it needs to listen to some popular sentiment. I'm not a hang 'em & flog 'em supporter but no-one can have the slightest sympathy with the fate of the two burglars. I have none.      This is a triumph for common sense. It was outrageous that Mr Martin was found guilty of murder. Fred Barras shouldn't have been in Mr Martin's house in the first place. Of course he didn't deserve to die but who can blame Mr Martin for protecting himself and his property. The law should protect victims of crime, not the perpetrators.      The burglar got exactly what he deserved. If he hadn't been illegally in the man's house then no harm would have come to him. Being unable to defend yours and your families lives in your own home should be made a crime. It's stupid and ancient laws like this that are partly the reason why I don't live in the UK anymore. At least in Texas I can rest assured that if I have a burglar in my home then I'll be able to use deadly force if necessary to protect my wife and I.      Tony Martin should never have been jailed in the first place. Here is a farmer, who lives out in the countryside and his property had been previously burgled. They should never have broken into his property in the first place!      The original conviction was the result of the cynicism by both the police and Criminal Prosecution Service. The police were aggrieved at being exposed as being, at best, ineffective and were determined to exact their revenge. The motto being - we know we can't do our job properly but heaven help those who try to help themselves. The CPS adopted the tried and tested technique of launching a prosecution against a soft target (a law-abiding man) employing a mixture of dubious evidence and character assassination. The motto here being - he might or might not have committed a crime but he is just the sort of nutcase who could commit one. The cynical attitude of this country's judiciary and police force are on the same level as the motivation of genuine criminals.      Anyone like Tony Martin who thinks that shooting dead burglars is reasonable force deserves to be locked up for much longer. If it was reasonable in the eyes of the law then we would have much harsher verdicts delivered upon convicted burglars. We don't even have the death penalty for murder. Why should the likes of Martin be able to administer their own conviction and punishment? I remember the case of a British tourist lost in Florida asking for directions who was shot dead by a homeowner because they suspected he could be a burglar. Do people want that sort of law and order? No, so lets leave to the police and the courts      The victim in this has been Tony Martin all along. If the lad hadn't been trespassing in the first place, he would still be alive. I do not believe it is wrong to defend your property in this way - especially if it keeps happening. In a gut reaction some people are likely to do things to an intruder that they would not normally do - fear does that to you. What happened to the other lad who was shot at? Was he charged with anything? Trespassing at least? I hope so.      I think manslaughter is the right verdict in this case. However I'm frankly appalled by the people who think that he should have got off scot-free. Even if shooting the intruder was justified as reasonable force, why did Mr Martin run away from the scene and go in to hiding? Why didn't he call the police (and send for an ambulance for the person he'd shot)? You have the right to use reasonable force. This doesn't give you a right to shoot first and ask questions later.      Justice has not been served. Tony Martin has done nothing wrong. It was dark, they were inside his house, there were two of them. They were intent on ill-doing. If they did not want shooting, they should not have been there. What about people who have heart attacks when confronted by intruders in such situations? This is one of the grossest miscarriages of justice ever. Who poses the biggest threat to society?      He should be released immediately and given a huge compensation for this miscarriage of justice! Criminals are getting away with far too much these days! Why is it our nation is taken to a bloody war in order to combat an attack against another country, but people here continually get treated like criminals, and the real criminals get away with stuff? I'm getting very very fed up with the way things are declining legally, morally and judicially.      People are killed regularly by burglars. Recently there was a case of a young woman who died of a heart attack upon returning home to a burgled home. I would like to know just how a man is supposed to defend himself against a greater number of fitter and younger attackers. A single blow to the head can be fatal! We should be allowed to defend ourselves without question in our own homes.      On the facts of the case as stated originally I agreed with the jury, however, it seems that yet again, lawyers and the legal system did a poor job, so the appeal is upheld. To answer the question about a shotgun licence, I understand Martin's had be revoked some time earlier after another incident.      I'd like to know what liberal Phil would do he found two thugs in his house. Ancient English law says that your home is your castle      Yes, justice has been served. Manslaughter is the correct verdict. It was ludicrous that Tony Martin was found guilty of murder, but let us not forget the following, as your correspondent Eric Deveraux obviously has. The judge at the original trial did not allow the jury to find Tony Martin guilty of manslaughter, only murder or to find him not guilty. Given the evidence which some of your correspondents admit they did not see and the later revelations that Tony Martin had convictions for illegal possession of firearms, the only option given to the jury was a verdict of guilty of murder. It is all too easy for the right-wingers among us to say that the burglars ""deserved"" it, but I do not want a situation where people discharging firearms willy-nilly. What precedent will this set in a society where crimes involving firearms are rocketing? Let Tony Martin out in a few months when he has truly learnt is lesson.      Why is the victim of a crime punished? I don't understand! Two people break into a remote house with the aim to steal everything valuable they can carry and our system supports them?      To an outside observer, this appears to be a case of the appeal court pandering to popular opinion. In essence, they seem to have retired the case, based on a different defence to that given in the trial, without the prosecution being allowed to fully counter the new defence.      As for Tony Martin, a man who arms himself and knowingly shoots an unarmed youth in the back deserves considerably more than 2 1/2 years in jail. At the time, the doomsayers predicted that the verdict would lead to complete lawlessness in the countryside. None of this has come to pass. The rule of law must be upheld and it no longer appears to that it has been in this case.      He should never been sent to prison. I am so grateful I wasn't on that jury being glared at by a load of henchmen. If that wasn't intimidation!!! Our juries should be located in police stations and the court case transmitted by video to them.      The pendulum has swung too far. Tony Martin should be released now. His 'crime' was to protect his property and was punished for it. Has the world gone mad? It is not the fault of the police but of the judicial system in this country. Break the Law and you are afforded the full protection of the Law, become a victim and the Law will victimise you further. It is time for Justice to prevail in this once green and pleasant land!      The question here is did this main behave in a 'reasonable' manner and use an appropriate level of force? The original jury didn't think so and the appeal judges seem to have agreed. His appeal rested on his original defence having been conducted wrongly, not on the his actions and how the jury interpreted them. Yes, if his defence had been handled correctly in the first place it might not have been a murder conviction but perhaps manslaughter, but it is clear that he still used an unreasonable degree of force and killed a 16 year-old boy. And no, I don't condone burglary either.      Tony Martin should never have been put in prison and is sadly a victim of political correctness gone wrong. It was recently reported in a newspaper that a 90 year-old pensioner was asked to remove barbed wire that surrounded her garden fence because it could cause an accident should anyone try to climb over. This woman was burgled 6 times in 18 months and after putting up the wire was no longer burgled. However the council demanded she remove the wire to protect the burglars from injury! Its about time people realised that someone's home is their castle and they have every right to protect themselves and their loved ones.      There is a difference between defending one's property, and shooting to kill. No matter what Tony Martin thought (and it is now clear that he has a personality disorder) the fact is that he shot and killed an unarmed 16 year old. Of course he should be in prison. It is probably correct that the verdict has been reduced to manslaughter, but there is no way Martin should go free until his new sentence is served. To say that he should have not been found guilty is to give a licence to kill - and a very dangerous precedent could have been set. And I have to agree with the comment from Chris - surely any sort of gun licence should be refused if the applicant has a paranoid personality disorder?      Why was someone with a ""personality disorder"" allowed to have a shotgun licence?      By all accounts, Mr. Martin waited in armed ambush night after night for the opportunity to shoot someone breaking into his house. He achieved his warped ambition and was justly convicted of murder. All the gung-ho rednecks who supported him must be gleeful today, because it now looks as if you can literally get away with murder. My views will be in a minority here, I suspect, as this vile judgement is applauded by miscellany of slavering ghouls.      The criminal records of each of the burglars shows that all three had violent tendencies. Facing a choice between being caught and making an escape, I have no doubt that they would have been prepared to inflict similar injuries on Mr Martin. If they hadn't gone out that night intent on getting their kicks from making another human being's life a misery, the tragic death would never have happened. If you live by the sword, you run the risk of dying by it.      Martin shot a man in the back with an unlicensed weapon, that is wrong. But how do we defend our homes in rural areas where our support from the police is non-existent?      So you only get five years for killing a sixteen year-old in cold blood with a shotgun. Where is the justice for the lad's family? I certainly don't think there is a place in our society for bigots with guns. They should throw away the key.      Faced with intruders with unknown but, fair to assume, malicious intent, I defy any of this man's judges in a similar situation to have done other than try their best to ensure that the intrusion was repulsed by whatever means were available. On that basis, what Martin did should not have been judged 'unreasonable'.      Tony Martin should be released now and given compensation for a miscarriage of justice. Anybody that breaks into another person's house deserves to be shot.      I suspect that the law on using force against intruders will not be any clearer than it was before. Such cases in the future are likely to lead to the use of 'plea bargaining' by the CPS. One point that has astounded me is that the court of appeal accepted that Mr Martin's case was not properly presented at his trial - something they have not entertained in the past, usually telling appellants they couldn't have two bites of the cherry because their defence team did a poor job. This is for me seems to be the major move forward from this decision.      I still think he should never have been convicted in the first place. The law on self-defence should be reviewed and allow those who might otherwise be beaten or killed the right to defend themselves. As far as I'm concerned, once someone attacks you or your property, they immediately forfeit all rights before the law. The more we fight back against attackers, burglars etc, the less likely those who would usually commit these crimes will be to carry them out. Martin did the right thing.      It's interesting that the court actually upheld the original jury's decision that Martin used unreasonable force to defend himself. The charge was reduced to reflect the fact that the personality disorder he suffers from meant he was legally 'insane' at the time of the shooting. The decision has no precedent value whatsoever on the point of what is reasonable force.      Tony Martin's life has been destroyed because two yobs decided to invade his property and he tried to defend himself. The message of the original verdict was that the householder should simply let the burglar get away with it. The message of today's verdict is that a householder can use force to resist a burglar but they will be seen as equals when criminality and punishment are assessed.      Tony Martin is an unfortunate individual who reacted in panic to yet another attack on his home. He did what most people would like to do but dare not because the criminal justice system in this country is now geared to protecting the burglar and the mugger and the yob. I believe that Tony Martin was perfectly within his rights to do what he did. The law need to be changed to protect householders against those who seek to invade their property. Tony Martin should be freed at once and pardoned.      In the USA he would have been in the right to start with. We cannot have laws to protect criminals.      I find it totally outrageous that a man confronted by two burglars (in his own home) is found guilty of taking whatever means at his disposal to protect himself, his family and his property. The guilty parties are the burglars themselves. If they wish to indulge in criminal acts, then they should accept the consequent risks, with NO limitation! In my view, Tony Martin should be released immediately and compensated (handsomely) by the government for the time he has already spent in jail.      I feel so strongly about this subject. Justice hasn't been served - Mr Martin should be acquitted. He found himself in an appalling situation. For what possible reasons was he confronted by these two individuals, IN his HOME, at the dead of night, other than to violate his property or worse himself? Yes, loss of life is a high price to pay, but how much absolute misery do burglars inflict upon the victims whose homes they violate?      I agree totally with protecting your property, especially with this case. This man lived in an isolated house in the countryside. What would have happened the 16 year-old had a gun? Possibly Tony Martin would be dead.      As the victim of two burglaries I would almost certainly shoot to protect hearth and home. Tony Martin should be released now.      He didn't do anything wrong. Why is he in prison anyway? It's the professional risk of a thief to be punished in one way or another. Let him go now!      Tony Martin should be released immediately - his only crime was to defend himself against burglars who, for all he knew, could have been armed themselves.      There's a fine line here between offering an open invitation to thieves since police can't or won't intervene to protect householders, and condoning acts of violence in the name of protecting property. What constitutes ""reasonable force"" in protecting your property should be clearly defined so nobody can be in any doubt of the consequences (a) of breaking and entering, and (b) of taking vengeance.      That said, the balance seems to have swung too far in favour of the criminal, and Tony Martin has been treated very harshly. In my view, he should be released on parole immediately.      He should never have served any time in jail. He was only defending his property and this should be the right of everyone in this country. The people who broke into Martins house had criminal records up to their necks. Personally I think they got what they deserved.      In the USA people shoot and kill countless of burglars and intruders. It's hard to say, but they shouldn't have burgled his property!!!      Not having access to the details, it's difficult to say whether the verdict is sound or not. In terms of the right to defence against criminals though, I think the judgment is a step in the right direction. I for one am sick of being forced by law to take whatever's coming to me. Like most people I am not a large man, and so I do not have the luxury of being able to administer ""reasonable force"" with my bare hands. It's about time this insane situation was reviewed, especially for women, who are currently totally unprotected by law. The situation is so bad that we are unable even to count on passers by for help, as even sufficiently powerful bystanders will generally not risk being judged to have used unreasonable force.      In broad terms I very much applaud the change of sentence and have always felt that the original verdict was unjust. My view is that if you go inside other people's dwelling houses (not just on their land), where they have a right to feel secure and may have family, you know it is wrong and should expect that from time to time the consequences could be unpleasant. The people in this case knew it was wrong and simply should not have been there.      Once you make a decision to violate someone else's property, you must expect to be caught and suffer the consequences. I feel we have gone too far down the road of giving the criminal the right to cry ""foul"". If you break the law, you give up any such rights. Tony Martin should never have been taken to court, and should be freed and pardoned now. It is high time we had a firm definition of how much force is ""reasonable"" to defend your property and your own life, and this case has done nothing to give us such a definition.      The fact is they were never going to let Martin free as the courts would lose too much face and the judges are not that brave. Tony Martin has lost his home and his life through no fault of his own. He did not ask for Barras and co. to come to his house. Martin would have been better off claiming to have been a member of the IRA.      No. He should never have been locked up to start with. Its easy to say in the light of day but if you get woken up in the dead of night, in an isolated location by people deliberately breaking into your property, and you are scared and full of fear then the intruders should not be surprised if they got shot at.      Without a doubt, justice has been served. A life sentence for defending one's own property was always absurd. It's about time that British justice started supporting the victim rather than the criminal and this to me seems like a step in the right direction.      Absolutely. Tony Martin lived on his own and in fear of burglars. Both of the burglars chose to break the law and suffered the consequences. It is very sad that a young life has been lost but those of us who live in the rural community understand Mr Martin's actions. Maybe some good will come of it and some people will think twice before breaking into someone's house.       It's at least a step in the right direction! "
HOC HOC-EW 9.54 " I believe that the British Government should come to the aid of the USA. The USA would do the same for Britain.      I think the decision is outside Mr Blair's control. There seems to be some law (written and/or unwritten) that the UK will continually and unquestionably loyally be a lapdog to the US. I feel deep grief and sympathy for the victims an their relatives and a true testimony to all those that lost their lives would be for the US to strive for world peace. Part of this campaign for world peace does involve the eradication of terrorism, but this should, as Paddy Ashdown says, be done through justice and not revenge. If the US and UK governments exact harsh military strikes on Afghanistan then thousands of civilians are likely to lose their lives and they will have lowered themselves to the same level as the terrorists. Feelings of hate for the US and the west would strengthen in the Muslim world and a spiral of retaliation will occur on a much greater level than that already seen in Israel/Palestine.      Terrorism should be dealt with in a much more prolonged and rational manner then. An international treaty could be set up to prevent financial and state support for terrorism. Countries breaking that treaty would incur penalties and be held accountable. Fundamentalist groups, of all types of causes, should be put under close scrutiny and monitoring. The final testimonial to those dead and grieving from this attack would be for the US to assess why their is such hatred against them, particularly in the Muslim world in general, and work towards resolving these issues. There are two roads we can take from here, one is that of retaliation and destruction, the other is one of rational and intelligent campaign to work towards ending suffering and hatred in the world by mutual understanding. The question is, do western governments have the will and the ideas of how to achieve a rational solution? If not then they should not be leading us!      Whilst I agree totally that a response to this atrocity needs to be made and a war on terrorism (if successful) will make the world a more peaceful place for everyone, will congress be passing a law banning NORAID? The amount of money the IRA has raised over the years in the US to run a terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland and in the UK doesn't put the US in the best of lights. The UK also is responsible for harbouring individuals that other countries see as terrorists. I doubt there is a country in the world that hasn't allowed people to be resident in it that are seen by another country as terrorists. Remember one mans terrorist is another mans freedom fighter. The talk of ""any country that harbours terrorists will be a target in the war against terrorism"" is meaningless rhetoric. Sure go after Bin Laden and wipe him and his organisation off the face of the earth but then pause and take stock to see how practical any further acts are against other terrorist outfits.      The terrorist group which committed the atrocity in America last week have deliberately not claimed responsibility and we must ask the question ""why?"". An obvious answer would seem to be that their intention was to elicit the exact response from America that we now see. Although President Bush has declared it an act of war, it is in fact an act intended to initiate war. If President Bush and Tony Blair lead the world into a military campaign against countries they believe to be harbouring terrorists and attack those countries without regard to the innocent lives that will be caught up in the process they will inevitably stretch the compassion and goodwill of those countries beyond endurance and we will find ourselves at war with the Muslim world, a world which has chemical and nuclear weapons. By all means consider ways and means to attack terrorism and to defend against it, but do so with intelligence and restraint.      The British should adopt a measured, responsible approach. Not all of us Brits think we should blindly follow the USA.      The UK should give its full support to the US in its efforts to combat acts of terrorism. It is not only the question of the UK supporting the US in its time of need but also an attempt to protect all other nations of the world that are susceptible to such heinous acts. The UK should definitely show its support so long as the US takes calculated retaliatory actions that would be aimed at avoiding the loss of innocent lives.      The main role for the UK should be to try to curb the enthusiasm for ""retaliation"". We have far more experience of terrorism than the US has, and Blair needs to persuade Bush that more innocent deaths will only produce new generations of suicide bombers. A retaliation will never be ""measured"" and ""proportionate"" - especially since military action in Afghanistan is practically guaranteed to kill hundreds of thousands of the world's poorest people just from starvation! Ultimately a change in foreign policy and a willingness to engage in discussion is needed to end terrorism from the Middle East - not bombing and the demonising of the Arab peoples.      I was terrified when Bush was elected President but seeing how he has managed the current crisis, I am very impressed with his administration. I would have been uncomfortable with an immediate military response, which must have been very tempting. The US have tempered their anger and have behaved like responsible stewards of world peace. Personally, I am eager for my tax payments to be spent in assisting our transatlantic cousins in the war against these murderers. They must not be allowed to terrorise us.      I believe that the United Kingdom should stand side by side with the United States without a doubt. This incident is not just a terrorist incident, it was a carefully planned and executed attack on the major nerve centres of the United States. It was an act of war. Who will be next? If we stand by and do nothing this could happen again maybe even in Britain.      The UK should not get involved in revenge attacks, which surely will prove to be counter productive. I am afraid though that Blair's unrealistic and war mongering rhetoric will drag the UK into a cycle of violence. Why does he commit himself to such costly operations so easily when minute increases in the state pension come with such difficulty? Britain has to face up to the reality that it is no longer an empire and that being America's lapdog won't make it an empire again, no matter how empowering it might feel.     Britain should not get involved till there is suffient evidence that it was Bin Laden or someone else.      The UK has responsibility as a Nato partner to stand by America after the blitz of New York, just as Americans stood by Britain during our blitz. However this is not a conventional war and the solution to terrorism will need a combination of diplomatic (political) action, intelligence led action as well as limited military action.      With the estimate of British dead rising to 300, and the terrorists continuing to thumb their noses at the civilised world, there is only one place for Britain to be - right alongside America as a full partner and ally. This barbaric and bloody deed dare not go unpunished and we dare not let the terrorists get the impression that we are any more weak or forgiving of atrocities such as this than our American friends.      Britain should be 100 per cent involved. This is the view of everyone I know. No-one wants war; it has been forced upon us by the terrorists. Now all Western countries must do whatever is required to win it.      No matter how shocking the attacks last week were, we as a country have to seek a peaceful solution or one that does not involve our bombs killing and mutilating more innocent civilians. The Americans have to re-assess their foreign policy - without their support Bin Laden would not be there in the first place. I noticed Tony Blair went to church yesterday and then talked about waging war! It takes more courage, bravery and strength to seek peace. Any idiot can fire a gun. God help the world!      There is little doubt that the UK should be involved, along with a broad coalition of forces, in bringing those responsible to justice. I think our most useful addition to the effort would be in ground troop support, air-forces and most of all special forces, of which the UK has arguably some of the best in the world.     I would like to see the media take a wider view of this issue. Thousands of children, let alone adults, die EVERY day from malnutrition and poor healthcare etc, as a result of the wealth of the Western world. Let's have an international day of mourning for them every year until the governments of the world have come together to fight their hardships.      Obviously our role should depend on what action the US takes. The best outcome would be if the people responsible were handed over for trial. In this case the US would need little help, probably only intelligence support in collecting evidence. Unfortunately this outcome does not seem likely. In this case, if the US makes a measured response, targeting those responsible and taking care to minimise civilian casualties, we should support them to the full. This would include military support, intelligence support and diplomatic support as we probably have better relations with some Arab countries than the US. If the US is going to launch a full scale attack against a whole country, or undertake revenge attacks then we should give them no support whatsoever. Fortunately it sounds like the US will not take this route.      The UK government are hypocrites as usual. We have harboured enough terrorists in our time to make us prime targets for a US air strike. How about Colonel Muvunyi - the guy who was responsible for the massacre of hundreds of innocent people in Rwanda? He was claiming benefit and sheltering in Lewisham until being extradited?      We should ask the USA to take responsibility for allowing the sponsorship of the IRA that led to decades of terrorism in the UK.      Terror has to be fought with terror. That means kidnapping, assassination and torture. We won in the Malayan emergency by using these tactics, and the SOE in WW2 were also expert in such methods. We must offer 100% support to our US friends and supply as many cadres of cold-eyed, ruthless and unpitying specialists in playing it dirty that we can find.      I don't think that the actions can ever be condoned, but killing more people and their families cannot help the situation. Maybe some of the billions that have been put aside for weapons should be spent on food and education in these very poor countries, then they are less likely to support and commit actions against the west.      The UK's partnership with the USA is mutually beneficial on so many levels. So long as the decision taken by President Bush is well thought out, justified and 'reasonable', it is our responsibility to assist in the efforts. To take part in the war against terrorism is as important for us as it is to the Americans, even if WE haven't lost any big towers... yet.      As one of the few experienced Western leaders, Tony Blair's influence should be considerable and must not be squandered. There should be a commitment to not only finding the terrorists with no ""collateral damage"" but also to putting right some of the circumstances which have driven them to commit such atrocious acts.     I don't like criticising Miss Short because she seems one of the members of the Cabinet with much in the way of principle. Even so, I remember her being remarkably keen to bomb Yugoslavia 2 years ago - Andrew Rawnsley reports that she hugged General Guthrie after the first missions were flown. What can have inspired her sudden compassion for innocent Afghans that was so absent when considering innocent Serbian lives? Could it be that Afghan extremists have the capacity to strike at the UK, whereas Serbia didn't?      The UK is a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalists exemplified by the Birmingham meeting at the weekend. We as a nation must not allow these people to continue to incite religious and racial hatred against the West.      It is ok playing the part of policeman but they tend to forget that it isn't themselves that fight in these dreadful wars and risk their lives. Terrorists shouldn't be allowed to do this, but for God's sake don't lead us into World War III.     I strongly approve of the attitude that all terrorists should be targets, and providing that these people are taken out clinically, with minimal collateral damage, no decent person should complain. However I am less than happy with the attitude of the British Government who have declared war on the terrorists who attacked America directly (and the UK indirectly) but seem to have forgotten about our domestic terrorist problem which is far from resolved.     By all means, let's stand with the USA against terrorism, but Blair should take the opportunity - when it's the right moment to do so - to remind the Americans that by contributing money in Irish bars in the USA they are sponsoring terrorism in the UK. Clinton tried to tell his people this, but it doesn't seem to have worked. Maybe now is a good time to make them listen.      I think that Blair's first real concern should be towards the citizens of Britain. While it is important to stand by the US and to support this stance against terrorism, England is a far smaller country than America and has less resource for defence of its citizens. Military involvement should be treated with extreme caution and carefully thought out.      Whether this outrage is described as an act of war or not is no more than semantics. In its planning and execution it was a criminal terrorist attack, and that is how it should be responded to. A military response is entirely inappropriate. The UK, based on its experience of IRA terrorism (partly funded from the USA) must do all it can to urge a non-military response: instead, what's needed is the undeniably slower and less spectacular intelligence gathering to gain proof of guilt that will stand up to scrutiny, covert insertion and action to extract those individuals responsible and bring them to trial.      A military action will strike out bluntly in the general direction of a geographical area and cultural belief which we believe may be responsible for killing our innocents. That's what whoever perpetrated this outrage felt about the West.      The UK should support the US in the fight against terrorism, but should not support the cycle of violence which will surely be the result of Bush's highly charged words. Life is sacred and innocent life should not be lost. What will starting WWIII achieve exactly? This does not need to affect the whole world as Elaine from Dorset suggests.      Claire Short says that it will be unbearable if any UK people are killed in reprisals - wake up Ms Short - they already have been!! Can we really sit back and not do anything - this attack was not against America, you just need to look at the countries who have lost citizens (at least 20 of them) This was an attack against the world! and the world needs to stand against terrorism or all those people will have died in vain. I will fight for the right to go about my work in my office without threat. I want to be able to look out of my window without seeing a plane heading straight for me. Let us back the US to the hilt - we owe it to them! "
HOC HOC-KF 9.94 " The American system is far too based on retribution, and as a result has spawned a vindictive, bloodthirsty society. This must stop!      Surely knowing he is dead is enough - what does anyone have to gain from actually seeing it happening?     It's absolutely sickening that this man who is responsible for the untimely death of so many innocent people should have a say on anything regarding his most deserved execution. The media has been giving him too much attention and now we have to deal with whether his execution should be broadcast or not. Give him what he deserves: an execution without fanfare or attention.     Of course the US courts should allow it; with the single stipulation that the CEO of Entertainment Network star in the dress rehearsal.     Sell tickets, it would be a bestseller.     With so much violence on our screens (large and small) depicting murders and so on, it doesn't surprise me that someone somewhere wants to give us the real thing.... for a fee, of course. I'm not sure how much more base we can get without returning fully to mediaeval standards.     I like to think I am a civilised person, but if my wife or child had been killed in the bombing, I would RELISH watching him die, and give a big ""Yeeha!"" when he was dead. As somebody who did not lose a family member there, I have no desire to watch his death.     A note to Rob: Actually, support for the death penalty is around 70% in the United States, with opposition around 25%. Therefore people in the US DO overwhelmingly support the death penalty. It is not generally considered to be ""state-sanctioned murder"" as some argue, and thus its existence is clearly in line with popular opinion.     I wouldn't consider it adequate for the Government of the United States to help a convicted murderer achieve ""celebrity"" status by allowing the execution to be broadcast. He should be disposed off in the same manner as waste is.     While I fully support the use of the death penalty (my home state of Texas leads the entire world just about), I believe that there needs to be a limit when it comes to public executions. A century ago, we used to have public hangings, and it was a big event with parties and other types of entertainment. In this day and age, and considering the possible reaction to it from people who have never witnessed a public execution (like in the Middle East), I would recommended against it.     Just imagine that your father/ brother/ son was McVeigh and was going to be executed next month. Would you want it to be televised? Bill McVeigh ISN'T the guilty one and yet he has to be punished knowing his son will die on May 16th. At least give him the peace to know it's happening in private!     Timothy McVeigh, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!      Entertainment Network Incorporated. Their very name says it all, doesn't it? Of course the execution should not be broadcast. No one is doing this for fun. The only ones who have a right to view are the families of the 168 deceased. In fact, seeing as McVeigh seems rather keen to die for his beliefs, surely the true punishment would be to lock him up for 50 years and leave him to rot.     Only the relatives should be allowed to witness the execution and I am adamant that pay per view on the entertainment channel should not be an option. We have become a society which views death as entertainment because of the poor quality of movies and TV programmes. Enough is enough. Execution is not legalised murder, it's just too bad we did away with torture. . . but that's another topic for discussion.     The state-sanctioned murder of a fellow human being, guilty or not, is a sickening idea. The thought that some people, let's say millions, want to tune in, turn on as that plunger is pressed, and then casually turn over to Ally McBeal is a sad reflection of the changing trends in 'entertainment'. Despite this, if Mr McVeigh so desires, then it should be broadcast. If people want to pay to view, let them. It's their money to throw away after all.     I agree with McVeigh: we taxpayers have the right to observe the workings of our government. If it's OK with McVeigh, then US citizens have the right to watch the execution. What should really be put to death here is secret government.     I see the name of the company planning the pay-per-view have the word 'Entertainment' in their title. Are they classing this as entertainment? You would have to be mighty sick in the head to be entertained by state-sponsored murder.     An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. If the guilty killed someone close to me I would like a front row seat.     In response to Mark K, it is not true that the death penalty enjoys overwhelming support in the US. Almost 40% of Americans are against the death penalty and the numbers are growing to include more and more each year who wish to end capital punishment.     One of the reasons the Vietnam conflict was so unpopular in the US is because for the first time, television allowed the American public to see exactly what was involved. Until that point most people were swept along by the drum banging, jingoistic propaganda that was traditional during wartime. Once they actually saw their children killing and being killed, they took a very different view of war. So who knows, maybe McVeigh's execution should be televised. Perhaps when we see a human being murdered in our own living rooms we'll begin to question the process of killing people to punish them for killing people.     I don't see why it shouldn't be available for public viewing. However, I do find it a bit odd that a private company should make a profit out of screening it. If it must be pay-per-view the money could be made available to the families of the victims, or to an appropriate charitable trust.     No, for the simple reason that monsters like him must be kept from people's memories.     Executions should never be televised. The death penalty is legalised murder and should be abolished.      I don't understand how the US government can claim that it's right to kill someone, but wrong to let people watch.     I would have no desire to watch, but if people feel it is appropriate to watch justice meted out then I don't see why they shouldn't. The families of his victims in particular may want to help lay their own ghosts to rest by seeing the killer of their loved ones executed himself.     Just as I would not wish to stand by and watch innocent people being killed in a bomb blast nor would I wish to sit and watch a guilty man die by lethal injection. Considering the bomber is adamant to be put be death - seeing himself as some form of martyr - surely putting his death on the web for the world to see would be pandering to his whims. Not to mention that above all the entire question of making executions public for anyone, adult or child, to log onto on the web is so macabre it's sick. What is this world coming to?     If 'snuff' movies are illegal - so should this be. Only weird and twisted people would want to see someone killed.     Whilst we are at it let's bring back gladiator events and stake burnings!     Maybe if people were obliged to watch it, fewer would vote in favour of capital punishment. I would expect and hope that in an allegedly civilised and quite religious country, watching a man being put to death should put a few folk off their dinner.     Just think of the sponsorship and advertising opportunities...     Although I am strongly against the death penalty myself, I feel that the execution should be broadcast if the condemned man wishes it to. Where a nation supports the death penalty (and it has overwhelming support in the US) then I think that the people have a right to see what goes on in the execution chamber. Maybe then this would bring home to them that the death penalty can never hope to be clinical, quick, painless and 'civilised'.     No, I would not watch anyone's execution regardless of the crime. That someone actually wants to sell such a ""product"" (what else can I call it - it's obscene whatever name it's given) shows just how sick and greedy the world has become.     Maybe we could have a lottery draw on who gets the press the button as well ... I'd definitely enter that.     He watched people dying on TV after his bomb - so why not?      I don't see what relevance broadcasting an execution has to this supposed judicial system. Is it going to make his punishment any sharper? I thought this was supposed to be punishment for the guilty, not quick relief for the bored. We shouldn't be validating his actions with cheap immortality in the media. What's next - a pithy catchphrase before the final gasp? A quick song and dance number before they throw the switch?     Since the courts have already stated that the press (who have explicit constitutional protection) cannot do so, it is safe to say that a company trying to make a fast buck should get chucked out on their butts.     Never!     I know he did a terrible thing, but would anyone in their right minds want to watch it?     If a 'civilised' government has the ""right"" to legally commit murder, then its people should have the ""right"" to witness it. It doesn't stop me from thinking that both are abhorrent though, and the internet company's motives are dubious, to say the least.      We have sunk to a new low and are teetering on the brink of the lowest circle of Hell. Watching death as entertainment is way beyond mentally sick disgusting.      Of course we should allow it. It may be sick to commit such a act but since it is a judicial event that does not involve a minor, then the public has the right to view the execution. But if you don't want to view the execution then you also have the right to turn the channel.      In a country where schools are no longer safe, but threatened by a possibility of being massacred by a classmate seeking revenge, the last thing we should uphold is an execution made public that supposedly satisfies revenge. The US judicial system is not here for revenge, but justice. To cheapen the deaths of the victims in this way is both immature and damaging for a society that loves to consider itself civilised.      I believe this murderer should be punished publicly because his crimes were so disastrous that they affected the whole nation. Therefore the whole nation should be able to feel closure for the loss these people in Oklahoma City have felt.      The perfect recipe for making terrorism a success: First kill and maim a large number of people, then wait for the state to create a martyr for the cause, whatever the cause, on public view. Every cock-eyed cause in the history of the world has started with the same process. McVeigh wants his martyrdom to be as public as possible. What both he and the capital punishment lobby believe is that violence and death are legitimate tools in the war of ideas. America's complex divisions and structural problems will gain nothing from McVeigh's death. None of those who have lost family or friends will be one whit better off - only the fanatics in the desert will be reinforced. Better to leave McVeigh to die of old age in prison while his unfashionable cause withers and his continued existence reminds Americans of what happens when your economic and social programmes leave a large section of society feeling alienated and impotent.      I would personally love to watch this creep die for killing 160 of us Americans. My sympathy to victims and families.      I'm all in favour of the broadcast of McVeigh's execution. I want to watch it; it will be fun.      Absolutely not. It's not entertainment. All the public need to know is that the duties of the state officials have been properly carried out. There is absolutely no benefit in putting this on TV. It's a known fact that the death sentence is no deterrent, so the only reason to broadcast such an event is morbid gratification.      And countries like America think Saudi Arabia is barbaric in having public executions. At least there it's free!      I don't think that this execution, or any other, should be televised. The visage of death is supposed to horrify people. If this execution is broadcast, what's to say that future executions won't be? If this is allowed to become the norm, then more people will become insensitive to human suffering and death, and I believe that would be unhealthy for humanity as a whole. Ask combat veterans or police officers about the things they have seen, and you will come to the same conclusion.      Is it not true that the American citizens who believe most strongly in limiting the power of the state, are also the greatest proponents for state executions? Surely this is the ultimate sanction a state can have -- legalised power of life or death of its citizens? It's this kind of hypocrisy makes the public broadcast of this death penalty sentence for entertainment possible in the USA.      This is so disgusting! That Internet company should be ashamed of themselves.      How barbaric - I'm in favour of the death penalty, but this type of voyeurism is not called for. This is just someone somewhere trying to make a fast buck.      I am seeing a fundamental difference between Europeans opposed to the death penalty and Americans like myself who are generally not in favour of it. Most opponents here are against it because we know there are many flaws in our justice system. Thus, it is possible that someone innocent can be put to death. But unlike our European counterparts (who oppose the death penalty regardless of guilt or innocence), many of us do not oppose executing an admitted and unremorseful murderer like Timothy McVeigh. I do admit though, there is something creepy about wanting to make this execution a pay-per-view event.      Legalized murder indeed! Those are words crafted by those too weak to see to it that justice is served and killers of the innocent forfeit their lives as just punishment for their crimes. I personally have no desire to watch a lethal injection. A hanging, on the other hand...      That we're debating whether to broadcast an execution to the general public is definitely a sign of the times that we live in. And the fact that there is a demand for such a televised event only highlights what a by-and-large voyeuristic, made-for-TV society we've become.      Never, never, never. It is immoral to kill another human, and obscene to either broadcast it - in whatever medium - or to watch. Are we humans really stooping so low as to ogle the wanton murder of another, regardless of their crime? I am all for severe sentences for criminal acts, including murder, but never the death penalty. Even if the murderer had no right to kill others, that does not give the rest of humanity the right to kill him, nor to treat that 'legalised' murder as a spectator sport. I weep and pray for those states and countries that maintain the death penalty, and I find it sickening that there should be those in the media who feel it is OK to show a man being put to death.      Is America a sick nation? No. Think about this for a second before everyone starts judging 282 million people (sorry too late). People with twisted minds that are into this kind of thing are found everywhere. The notion of executing killers in public has been around a lot longer than we have. What makes the US stick out is its precious ""free-speech"" attitude that let's virtually ANYBODY suggest ANYTHING. That means all the stupid things people are THINKING about in your countries actually get said here. NOBODY is taking this seriously (except us). The only reason the US government went as far as to comment on the issue was because the lawyers of this fringe organisation (ENI) filed a federal lawsuit to get permission. This webcast couldn't be further from happening. Go to any respectable news site in the US, you won't even find the story. Does the American media have too much time on its hands? Yes. Sick nation? NO.      For a supposed civilised country America leaves a lot to be desired. Does the need for vengeance have to become the ultimate entertainment?      I personally feel a mixture of things: On the one hand I deplore execution and don't understand how any civilised country can entertain such a ""punishment"". On the other hand, I am actually curious to see what happens and how it is done. Would I watch myself? No probably not, but I do feel that if McVeigh's execution isn't broadcast, it's only a matter of time before someone else's is. It does reflect badly on the state of American society though, in more ways than one!      In the US, when there is an execution, there is always a huge crescendo leading up to the event, but the day after, the execution is largely forgotten. People move on and the media for once find no point in running the story much further. The execution of McVeigh should be viewed only by the family and a few officials. To show it live on television would by no means provide any ""closure"" to America. The sole motive for broadcasting the execution is sick entertainment; a ratings boost for the networks. Unlike every other execution, they'll be able to show this one over and over and over, and people will watch. In turn, it will incite a greater level of rage in underground anti-government organisations who already see McVeigh as a martyred patriot. To broadcast his execution will elevate him in their minds to something of a martyred god, making those people a far greater threat than ever before. Then again, the media want this, don't they? It gives them more blood and agony to broadcast.      Having recently watched a documentary on television covering the last weeks of a death row inmate's life, seeing his distraught and innocent family trying to deal with their imminent loss. Seeing the last minute denial of a pardon. All of these images gave me insight into how terrible and barbaric the death penalty really is. It also makes me realise that the final act of putting someone to sleep is actually less tragic than what goes on behind the scenes in the days leading up to it. My thoughts are with Tim McViegh's father. This man must be in great pain.      The worst thing the US government has been doing for years, is murder. The death penalty is no way to bring justice to a human. Once this man is dead, his troubles are over. He should be sent to prison room with nothing except food and a single light bulb. The sick thing in all this is that the media want to broadcast it. Now, the only reason they would broadcast it, is because they know it will entertain people, and people who watch, will be entertained by a real murder. If children saw this, they would remember murder as being entertaining, which is why they have a high murder rate.      I don't think the execution should be televised because that is exactly what McVeigh wants. He has had enough attention already. We should focus our energy on the victims' families. He should die in seclusion.      No, the viewing is for those that need closure. What a sick society this world is that we have murderers like McVeigh and we glorify murder through movies.      Where has the morality in human behaviour gone in this world? Are we trying to popularise and glorify a criminal's mindframe and mindset. Isn't this the height of pathos that even the public wants to be a part of this saga.      The objective of punishment should be that the criminal should pay for what he did and others should learn while looking at him being punished. By doing so, a person will think at least twice before placing a bomb or killing anyone. Criminals should be punished in public. Seeing is believing. If we see only one execution in our life, then we'll never think of murdering any one.      Only in America could they extend 'rights' to the level of watching an execution on TV. No doubt this will give the media great debates with opinions by all manner of experts, social, religious and self-appointed. By all means televise it, you don't have to watch.      Is it just the case of some person/company trying to be clever and push the borders of media/history - for all the wrong reasons? I don't think watching a guy being killed will help anyone; it's like medieval times.      America is one of only a few countries in the world to still carry out a death sentance. Incarceration for the rest of my life in solitary would be my idea of hell, killing someone is quick (although not painless). The death penalty does not act as a deterent or this bombing would not have happened. The UK ended public executions over 100 years ago, using technology to watch some die is sick and deeply wrong. What will we learn from the first web broadcast of an execution?      People like McVeigh not only cease to serve a positive roll on society, but actually have a severe negative and destructive influence on it. Because of this, I feel there is no real point in supporting and sustaining his life, therefore removing him completely from the world around us seems the natural thing to do. However, this can have an effect on certain people, possibly creating a hero out of a monster, For this reason I believe that any media attention should be avoided from the actual sentencing down to the punishment.      A lethal injection is what your vet gives your beloved and dying family pet to avoid suffering. Timothy McVeigh should live and suffer - he deserves a life that would discourage others from following his example.      I can't believe that any person would want to watch another human die! No matter how bad that person is. Are we so desensitised that this kind of behaviour is now normal? The thought of purposely watching a person die turns my stomach. I say ""NO"" to televising McVeigh's execution!      It is not deterrence for which the death penalty exists. Nor vengeance, nor to teach a lesson. It is justice. It is the justice that if we are going to do something so unspeakably contemptible as to remove the life of an innocent, society must know the value of that life and the price that must be paid for it. Not an eye for an eye, but life for life. While we can and must personally forgive this man and pray for God to have mercy on his soul, society must be inflexible in applying the only justice that is appropriate to the atrociousness of his crime. If, following his death, it was to be found that an accused was not after all guilty, would not his compensation from God for this error be correspondingly enormous in the afterlife? Without question it would be. Let the world watch - not with hate in its heart, nor pity, nor to learn, but to understand. It is wrong to kill the innocent but it is right to kill the killer.      Since I don't even believe in the death penalty in the first place, I think it would be very immoral and wrong to broadcast such an event.      An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. What will Timothy McVeigh's death by lethal injection prove? I agree he has to be punished. What are the motives for his punishment? Death is a very easy way out for him. The American people who lost their loved ones have to live with their feelings of loss. Timothy? He just needs to say goodbye and that's it. He does not care what will happen to him after his physical body ceases to function. It seems he will be given a good deal. If Timothy dies from the lethal injection, will this stop all the gun shootings in the schools, terrorist attacks on buildings and people, mass suicide because of an individual's beliefs, issuing of guns to whoever can afford it, violent attacks by white policeman and what have you? What are our true motives when we punish someone? Is it vengeance or is it a form of lesson? A lesson which will change this person or cause him/her to repent and forever turn away from works of evil, which means we give him/her a chance to continue to live his/her life.      I think the execution should be on Pay-Per-View and have all the proceeds go to the survivors and the victims' families.      I would certainly not watch the execution. On the contrary I am of the opinion that instead of putting him to death he should be put into prison for life so that he can repent for his sins.      Rather un-PC I know and Amnesty Int'l who I admire wouldn't let it happen, but my theory on modern punishment (which would ideally apply to McVeigh) is as follows. Victorian prisons were actually a rather technological approach to criminals - the ability to build large prisons was efficiency itself and a world away from the inhuman conditions of the medieval dungeon. We are still maintaining this particular penal model in the third millennium when we should, in fact, take advantage of the technological advancements we have made with virtual reality or drugs to REALLY deprive people of their liberty, protect society etc etc. Death is too easy (clearly) and also too finite - stick some hallucinatory drugs inside them and put them on a drip.      Of course people will watch. We never see death HAPPEN - we see it faked (films) and we see the bodies - Srebrenica, Dachau, the road to Basra. If death IS caught on film - eg JFK's - we all want to see it again, and again, and again. Drive along any motorway: witness the morbid desire of normal people to examine a pile-up on the other carriageway. Death fascinates us - it's a once in a lifetime experience. If you think people will become bored of it, remember - the pornography industry makes billions from depicting a very commonplace activity...      Timothy McVeigh is committing government-assisted suicide. He is in control of the media-inspired frenzy, hungry for sensationalism through violence. Americans are so revengeful that they haven't grasped that the most painful penalty they could inflict on this despicable character would be to lock him away for life, rotting in obscurity. The upcoming circus sideshow will only turn yet another disgruntled domestic terrorist into a folk hero. Shame on America for engaging in barbaric acts that stem from their addiction to guns. I am suggesting that since they have decided to murder McVeigh on television, then they should decapitate him. It would make for much more exciting viewing.      A disgusting crime was committed but I cannot see the legitimacy of such a public execution. I do believe that we still live in a civilised community.      What is in the public interest, and what interests the public, are not one and the same. Broadcasting an act, which in itself has so clearly failed as a deterrent, panders to the very lowest of human achievement. The first word in the name of the company that wants public broadcast rights (Entertainment) says it all. If McVeigh is to be truly punished, let him be denied the notoriety he so obviously seeks.      Remember the film the Running Man? Well it smacks of this idea. The next thing we will see is some sort of weekly soap where innocents shall be put to death for our entertainment. No, it shouldn't be shown and in my eyes America is becoming a sick nation.      It would be one thing if we were forced to watch the execution, as was the case in medieval times, and are still required to do in parts of the world. I think if the crime was committed against our entire country, it should be allowed to be viewed by the entire country. If you don't want to watch it then don't.      The web site would not be making any money from this broadcast. A small charge by credit card is being made to verify age and any profits made are being donated to victim charities. Why not let his execution do some good?      McVeigh wants his execution broadcast so that he can, in his eyes, martyr himself to a cause. Why give this killer a new forum? And as far as the death penalty itself, critics from countries that just passed legalised euthanasia don't have a leg to stand on. It's okay to take the life of an elderly person who can't live without a respirator, but it's not all right to take the life of a killer who called the death of toddlers ""collateral damage""?      I don't think I'd watch, in fact I think the idea is fairly revolting, and until recently I'd have said that that means a broadcast shouldn't happen. Having read a very good article on the matter, I recently changed my mind. If a country has the death penalty, they should see it through right to the act - we shouldn't have punishments which are swept under the carpet for whatever reason - if it's disgusting, and not fit to be seen on TV, don't have the punishment in the first place. I think all but the most bloodthirsty would be shocked with how it actually happened - the idea that people simply fall asleep quietly and quickly is an invention of the media to make the whole thing a little more bearable.      If McVeigh has no right to live, then he should certainly have no right to choose whether or not his execution is televised. I was living in the Oklahoma City area on April 19th, 1995. I volunteered at blood drives, and handed out water to rescue workers. I witnessed the implosion of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and smelled the air that reeked of the tragedy yet, under NO circumstance would I watch this execution. I agree that Timothy McVeigh should die as a result of his actions, but to allow him to make a mockery of our country by turning this into a media event is absurd. I think that the victim's families should have a right to choose whether they want to view or not, but no means should this become a public spectacle.      I suppose bombing and mass destruction are horrendous crimes, unless you call it war. Then you can kill all you want. For example what was the point of the Nagasaki bombing? Didn't Hiroshima make the point? Could it possible be that the bomb that killed thousands of people was dropped not to end the war, which was already over after Hiroshima, but to demonstrate US power? Of course this couldn't be murder, because as we all know that second bomb was justified. Yeah, right!      There's a lot of talk about how immoral the death penalty is, however the only other option that seems to be offered is that he is allowed to rot in a jail cell with only food and one light bulb - which is more immoral? I would also say that the public have the right to see him put to death. After all America is the land where free speech is held so dearly that people will die to protect that right. Those who find it immoral are not being forced to watch the event after all. Let me decide what I will or will not watch.      A criminal, murderer and terrorist must be killed in same way as he or she killed innocent people and it should telecast on all TV channels so that no other person dares to do any act of terror. This is the only way to stop crime - look at the example of Saudi Arabia which has an amazingly low crime rate and literally zero AIDS cases.      We are all voyeurs. If public hanging were bought back - the crowds would be enormous. If gladiator contests were bought back, the ratings would go through the roof. Don't fool yourselves, underneath the thin veneer of civilisation, we are still barbarians!      How can people be in favour of execution, yet not be in favour of having it televised, especially when McVeigh has agreed to it? Execution is a horrible, ugly thing, and those who support it (as well as those who do not) should have the right to know exactly what they are looking at, and that it isn't completely pretty.      I would watch if the punishment fit the crime. But his victims died by truck-bomb while he will merely be put to sleep like an old dog.      Anyone who supports the death penalty but doesn't think that the execution should be shown on television is guilty of sticking their head in the sand. All supporters should feel obligated to watch and then reconsider whether they still believe that the death penalty is a humane way of punishing a fellow human being.      My state has suffered enough from this fiend McVeigh. He destroyed the lives of hundreds of people and maimed hundreds more. My city will never been the same again. Let him die in solitude, unwatched and without fanfare, just like so many citizens of this great city did at his evil hand.      Outrageous. What is the U.S thinking??      The crime committed by McVeigh is barbaric and hence he should have been publicly hanged or shot. This would have served as an example for people who think blowing up hundreds of people is justified to make a socio-political or personal point. There is no harm in screening his execution, however it should be nationally televised and no party should financially benefit from it.      I would not watch the execution broadcast as it could make a martyr of a vicious murdering terrorist who has no remorse for his crimes. I do feel that in addition to the survivors and victims families being allowed to watch, that they should permit the rescuers who were at the Murrah Building to watch. It might bring them a certain sense of closure. I have met a number of the rescuers who were there that day. I know of at least one who has recurrent nightmares about dead babies. If watching the execution would help these people, it should be allowed.      I have mixed feelings about the death penalty. Although I agree that the system cannot support all the criminals, who are we to terminate a life? Is it up to us? I think he should spend the rest of his life in jail, forgotten and alone...      If the company offering this as entertainment say any money will go to the victim's families then let them broadcast it. Why not let some good come from such a hideous crime - it would probably be the last thing Timothy would want.      I agree that it is macabre, sick and twisted. The Internet companies are only interested in making money, not in the ""ethics"" of the situation. I am totally disgusted with this abhorrent trend including ""reality TV"", where even more sick and twisted people get off on watching relationships break up (Temptation Island) or people being pushed to the limit (Boot Camp). Why are such technologically advanced societies so Neanderthal in their tastes? (And that's an insult to Neanderthals; I apologize).      We punish criminals only because they endanger the community. We shouldn't enjoy their punishment though. I am absolutely against showing it on TV or Internet.      One must remember that it was McVeigh's request that his execution be public. He stopped the appeals process and apparently wants to get his death done with as quickly as possible to facilitate his being crowned as a martyr by anti-government radicals; his death being televised would further cement his place in their hearts. It would be a grave mistake to do anything more than allow those wishing closure to view his execution - although I doubt that it will help ease the pain of their losses.      As a taxpayer, I'd rather see him executed then have to pay for him to live the rest of his life in a Federal prison somewhere. By that I mean I don't want my money going to feed, clothe and house the man that slaughtered more than 180 innocent people.      I'm just worried it might attract the wrong crowd. The next Timothy McVeighs. I don't think anyone needs to see what has to be done. Show us the black smoke and we'll be off.      Just because 70% of people in the US support the death penalty doesn't mean that it's right. Isn't it about time we stopped this barbaric practice? I have lost a friend in a bomb blast myself but would get no satisfaction in seeing the person responsible put to death. How would you feel if your brother was executed to discover years later they were innocent?      I don't know what all the fuss is about. It's going to be broadcast on the Internet and unless you log on to the website you won't be seeing it. In this situation we all have a choice to either log in or not.      Go for it, make the pictures available to the public, bring out their lowest instincts, just do it. After a couple of executions, the sight of someone dying through a ""simple lethal injection"" will not be sufficient anymore. Not enough blood, not enough action. The public will ask to be allowed to see hangings and deaths in the electric chair, which are so much more gruesome and spectacular. It might even go wrong, picture that, what a audience puller, here's something to talk about the next day in the office; ""Oh, you haven't seen this one? Don't worry, it's saved on my hard disc, I'll mail it to you"", and before you know it, we'll be back to the middle ages, with public executions, but 21st century ones mind you, with a few sound and light effects. The killer as a superstar... No, seriously, they have lost it completely!      It does seem strange to me that a society where death is so taboo, and where the word is avoided by all sorts of euphemisms like 'passed away', there is a clamour to see an execution live on the net. And I certainly do not think this should be at the request of the murderer. He needs to be thinking hard about what is going to happen next.      We all love vengeful justice. Did we not love the justice in the Count of Monte Cristo and The Outlaw Josie Wales? This whole thing is testament to justice and we should be happy it's being served.      It should not be broadcast. The truth is that if it is broadcast it will garnish major league ratings. Humans like to think they are high-minded and that we have evolved. We are still essentially a bunch of savages. We like to see accidents, we all watch the guy breaking his leg in football (either variety), we all slow down at accidents on the highway to see what happened. We are curious about death and our own mortality. If someone emailed you the video, you would watch out of a morbid sense of curiosity. Why not if you could watch by yourself and have your own little piece of moral decadence - wouldn't you? Personally I just want to know what he says before he goes. I don't see any way that he could justify his actions.      Many people in support of the death penalty never really think about the issue, but sadly many have and still come to support it. I think this is one thing that, no matter how popular it is or becomes, it just shouldn't be. God forbid my convictions were put to the test, but more death can't be the answer. I would be for televising or webcasting the execution if I didn't know so many people would relish it. There are some things you don't give people on a platter. I want it broadcast for all those who support this punishment, and I want it kept private because of those same people.      Revenge is such a Christian emotion, isn't it? Baying for someone's blood and the right for it to be taken seems eminently civilised, particularly if they are guilty of an atrocity. Nothing wrong with watching the Christians being thrown to the lions, eh? Communities have the right to decide on murder as a punishment, but please don't mention your God and civilisation in the same breath. The taking of someone's life without their permission IS murder, whatever the justification. If you can't face up to that, your society shouldn't be permitting it.      Hey! What's on TV tonight? Great! An execution! Get out the popcorn and beers and let's have a ball. This is obscene. Capital punishment is obscene and degrading for all involved.      McVeigh is already considered a martyr by many for his beliefs. Why reinforce this fact by allowing a network broadcast?      McVeigh has a family too - would you like to know that your neighbours and friends were watching your son being killed live on TV - I don't think so. If America has the death penalty, why don't we introduce a system where criminals are given a punishment similar to the crime they committed - then we could break into burglars' homes and nick their TVs. The death penalty is no way to punish a person; people will start thinking ""if the government can do it - why can't I?""      I agree with the majority of the comments made in this discussion. However, I am surprised at how many have reacted to the prospect of people wanting to watch the execution. The point is that there are lots of people that would like to watch it and they would watch it regardless of the crime, country, race, creed, gender, innocent or guilty. I am not one of those people, but it's worth pointing out that they are a large minority. Let's also not forget the number of public executions that go on all the time outside the USA - less people complain about these so why the big fuss now.      The ""eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" brigade may feel better after they have had their ""fix"" of revenge on the 16th May. They might even get a bigger dosage if they watch Mc Veigh's execution on TV. But in a year or two, will the pain of loss of their loved ones be any less?      The man did an evil, terrible thing. Nothing can bring back those he took way. However the question over whether the world should watch is just one more variable in one more American tragedy. America does not want to admit it but she is in love with violence. One more school shooting? Roll out the politicians and let them mouth some more vague statements designed to satisfy everyone and no one at the same time. One more workplace murder? The same story - empty, hypocritical, quasi-religious rhetoric from yet another mealy-mouthed politician. The truth of the matter is plain to all. Whether America chooses to see it is another matter altogether.      People have the right to watch anything but that doesn't make it right to do so. Maybe televised executions, blood and all, would convince Americans what a barbaric act it is. Statistics show that capital punishment is not a deterrent anyway.      This presupposes there to be a deterrent effect in broadcasting an execution. Historical evidence from the days when public hangings in Britain were common suggests that, on the contrary, this gruesome event incited more violence among bloodthirsty spectators than it ever deterred - hence the end of the public gallows. When will we ever learn that violence breeds violence?      If one of your 10 (Christian) Commandments says: ""I should NOT kill"", then why take someone else's life away? Execution is wrong. It is a method of taking someone else's life. Life sentences should be introduced like we do in Europe. Only God can take life away.      If it would deter one more murderer from committing this monstrous act then yes perhaps it would not be a bad idea, unfortunately I doubt it would have that effect. Do we really want gladiatorial rituals via our PC monitors? Personally I do not. In the 21st century I hope we are civilised enough not to require this type of ""entertainment"".      I do not support execution but if you are do it properly, hang, draw and quarter him in front of a live audience - the notion that lethal injection is civilised because it is painless is absolutely ludicrous. Yes show the execution live let people know what execution is - barbaric and useless, the death of McVeigh will not bring one relative back and I doubt whether it'll make anyone feel any better!      McVeigh should not receive a platform from which to increase his visibility. It is already unfortunate that his name is better known than those of his victims. If the families really want to watch, that is their choice, but I do not want to see this thing turned into some sort of ghoulish spectacle, we already have so many strange voyeuristic forms of ""entertainment"". I don't understand the fascination with such things myself. For the record, the US stopped public hangings in the early 20th century to stop the violence that followed these public events. I doubt that this would ensue from a televised execution of the sanitised sort, but don't see this as an excuse to make it a form of entertainment.      In response to Neil, and our other friends from the UK, it is not so much that the US has a right to commit murder, than the fact that Mr McVeigh has forfeited his right to life by murdering dozens of innocent people. With crimes of this magnitude, justice demands that his life be taken away from him. I do not believe, however, that this should be televised. It will present Mr McVeigh with a forum in which to showcase himself and his dangerous views.      There are no benefits in showing an execution in public. If there was, hanging people in public would have still been around...      In my personal opinion, putting someone to 'sleep' is brutish. Besides that, it is cruel to make someone count his days and it is even more fiendish to have millions watching a person being sent 'away'.      No. We need to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with our God. Justice requires he be executed for his crime, but we need to respect his humanity and treat him with dignity but surely carry out the just penalty for his act. By giving him justice we give due value to the victims of his crime, and we send him on to the true court of justice before his Creator.      While McVeigh may be guilty, many of those who die each year in US prisons are innocent. Many are stitched up by the police or abandoned by their lawyers. Some are framed. Are we seriously thinking of paying to watch people be executed when there is a hefty suspicion that many have done nothing wrong?     Seems a lot of people missed some key points in news stories posted right on this site. 1. The guy is going to die. Nobody is forced to watch it but it will happen anyway. 2. The private web company has stated profits will go to victims families. 3. The victims' families are already going to watch the execution on closed circuit TV.   Is this the 21st century? It seems to me we are at times stuck in the bygone era of public hangings and guillotines. Should I drag out some knitting? "
HOC HOC-KH 9.54 " Prostitution saved my marriage and helped several ladies pay their rent. Once I realised that my incessant mid-life cravings could be easily and safely satisfied - I actually stopped obsessing over it and stopped lusting for my female associates. I now enjoy true freedom from lust and a happy 20-year marriage - and I owe it to knowing that sex is just a phone call away. Stop the pimps, legalise it. Morality? What male asked for this wanton role?      There should be a pilot project to legalise prostitution in one city. I would suggest Glasgow, where there has been a series of murders of prostitutes over the last few years. Before the moralists cry out with indignation, they should ask themselves this question: how many of these young girls who were brutally murdered would still be alive today if they had worked away from the back-alleys and in a controlled environment?  Legalisation would allow the authorities to help girls in need as their are too many bad guys willing to exploit and terrify some into being prostitutes. Legalization would open up the can of worms that has become and actually always has been that part of our society.  To those who argue that because prostitution should be accepted as an inevitable feature of society and therefore legalised, I think this is a very bad argument. If you take that line of reasoning, you could also say that since there is so much burglary in the UK, and making it illegal hasn't stopped it, why not de-criminalise burglary and make burglars pay taxes too. If burglary was no longer a crime, the crime rate would drop to new lows overnight. The same argument could be applied to the drug industry, child pornography, gun running, terrorism, illegal immigrant smuggling, or whatever else you care to name. Sure the moral and ethical aspects need more attention in this issue, as well as the greater good of society and the welfare of women.  Just because something cannot and will not go away is not a good enough reason to legalise it - look at murder for example. What matters is the signal that we would be sending out by legalising it. Okaying casual sex for money is another step on the slippery road of moral decline the western world is undergoing.  From pole dancing to modelling, all other professions using the body are legal - so why shouldn't prostitution be?  By making prostitution legal you get rid of pimps and organised crime in one fell swoop. By restricting where trade can take place e.g. industrial units, you get the pros away from public area's where they may cause offence or problems to local residents. It's the oldest profession - legalise it, regulate it and tax it.  Why shouldn't prostitution be legal as in Holland? The Dutch have a more enlightened attitude to sex and fewer consequent problems. I have never had any sexual involvement with prostitutes but grew up next-door to a girl who became one and have met others since. Some choose prostitution and others are real victims of circumstance. Legalisation within a framework might give more protection to those who need it whilst allowing freedom of choice for those who wish to sell or buy sex.  I'm trying to imagine people coming to me for careers advice about becoming a prostitute. I think the people who enter prostitution out of desperation will still do so, to pay for drugs or whatever. How many other tradesmen do jobs on the side for cash in hand? Would legislation also include males?  This is NOT a good idea as making it legal may send out the signal the people out there that it's a ""good"" thing. I'm against it for all the reasons, and yes some people choose to do it, however how many more are FORCED into prostitution? It makes me sick to think someone out there would even think about making it legal and further still taxing it? How about we spend some money on finding the cartels that exploit women and busting them? Heck I'd change my tune about getting taxed #2000+ a month if I knew it was being spent here, rather than filling the pockets of corrupt political fat cats.  Morality is a personal matter. Governments should not legislate on the basis of morality. In the case of prostitution, the British government would serve the population best by legalizing prostitution with the provision that prostitutes be made subject to regular and stringent health checks. As a concession to those offended by such activities, it would seem reasonable for the government to limit brothels to certain areas of cities.  I can scarcely remember a talking point issue where the opinions were so consistent. I say yes to legalization, no to the pimps, yes to better hygienic conditions, and no to generations of hypocritical heads stuck in the moral sandpit!      I was under the impression that in the UK, prostitution is in fact legal and it is soliciting that is illegal, but there again I'm not a lawyer.  Yes, it should be legalised to improve safety. But how on earth will they be taxed!! Will prostitutes have to give receipts for work? Will there be consumer rights if the customer is unhappy with the service provided?!  The decision as to whether one is to be involved in prostitution is based on both moral and economic factors that have nothing to do with the government. So I don't see the reason why the government should get involved unless underage persons are practising it. Furthermore most African governments have impoverished people making them engage in prostitution in order to make ends meet. So it would be immoral for the same governments to interfere with this lucrative trade either by way of regulations or imposition of taxes!  The legalisation and subsequent taxation of prostitution opens up an interesting can of worms, i.e. that it will be subject to the Sale of Goods Act and that as such clients will presumably be able to dispute payment on the grounds of ""as adverstised"" and or ""fit for the purpose for which it is intended"" and or (and most promisingly) of ""merchantable quality""...Your Honour.  Prostitution is a legal activity in the United Kingdom and proceeds from it are liable to taxation. What is illegal here is soliciting the sale of sex and living off immoral earnings. Now what is it that you wish to legalise?  What is the point of making the earnings from prostitution taxable? Can you imagine that any prostitute is likely to declare an income remotely in line with what they actually earn - most of their income is likely to be cash in hand as opposed to invoiced in the manner of any other 'service' industry. However, it does seem like a dream job in the pipeline for HM Inspector of Brothels.  A prostitute's life is difficult enough as it is. Let them keep their earnings and give themselves a chance to gain a better station in life.  Prostitution is not about sex, so the tax concerned would not be a tax on sex. It would be a tax on the male right to procure access to women's bodies whenever they require. Instead of taxing it, we should be doing something about the phenomenon of prostitution itself!  Legalisation of prostitution would give prostitutes greater control over their earnings, their health, their safety and their bodies. Better still, sex slavery, pimping and all the other abuses associated with it could be clamped down on, if not removed altogether.  As a Brit who has lived in Amsterdam for some time now I feel qualified to make a few observations. Firstly, there is no doubt that the legalisation of prostitution has reduced the general ""seediness"" of the red light area and turned the sale of sex into just another commodity. Secondly, it earns a lot of money, legally, for both the city and the girls, reduces the incidence of pimping, radically decreases the health risks because of regular statutory health checks and has reduced crime associated with the sex industry. Thirdly, like it or not, it is a ""must-see"" attraction for all of the visitors I have to stay with me. In fact, usually the most embarrassing thing that one encounters in the area are the many drunken stag-nighters on a weekend trip over from the UK.  Prostitution could be as big as McDonalds one day. Prostitutes would ask you if you wanted a side order of fries with your purchase.      I would imagine most of the men support legalisation because they have visited prostitutes and most of the women oppose it because of a vague notion of ""female liberation"". We shouldn't even be having this discussion. Two consenting adults can do as they please without religious and political hindrance and without the tyranny of the majority.  Tax prostitution! Gaol everyone in HM Inland Revenue for ""living off immoral earnings""; held, so to speak, at Her Majesty's Pleasure. While they serve their terms, we'll all get a bit of peace.  I believe that prostitutes supply a useful public service. What is the difference between the girl who sleeps with a man who has taken her out for the evening and a girl who takes the cash up front? If legalising it means girls do not have to work for a minder, and are not forced into this way of life by criminal blackmail then I am all for it.  Yes, it should be legalised. The oldest profession in the world is never going to go away, so why criminalise it? It'll be better for the girls, better for the punters and better for the Treasury.  Prostitution is currently legal as I understand it. What is illegal is running a brothel, or for a prostitute to actively 'solicit' business. The law needs reforming in this area and I think prostitution should be completely legalised. The likely outcomes of this would be safer working conditions for prostitutes, a reduction in sex crimes by frustrated males, tax for the Government and the possibility of health checks making a visit safer for clients. This is not really a matter of morals. Prostitution is already big business as the study shows. Driving it underground is not the way to deal with it.  How low is this country going to sink? Money isn't everything!  Who cares about the black market, prostitution is still wrong. If you legalise it, venereal diseases will spread much faster and you will have to spend all of the money taken in on medical measures to combat infection.  Of course it should be legalised! It's the only way we can make sure (as much as it is possible) that the spread of sexually transmitted diseases is kept to a minimum and that young girls are not forced into an illegal activity. Let's get it off the streets, into regulated brothels and let's start making some money for the country out of this valuable resource!  Our Government prostitutes itself to big business so why can't we prostitute ourselves to big business men? Sadly however the British are ruled by greed, bigotry and ignorance and will never achieve the enlightened social principals of the Dutch.  It might as well be. The main thing is to prevent minors under the age of 18 from working as prostitutes and also to prevent anyone from being forced into it against their will. Maybe the best way to ensure that is to make it legal. And if they were forced to pay tax then it would be a windfall for the government.  Yes, especially since the law should reflect reality rather than denying its existence. Tax and registration are two benefits; others include health and well-being of prostitutes and their clients, and to help eliminate the drugs, slavery and other criminal connections of parasites feeding off the earnings of prostitutes.      Prostitution is said to be one of the oldest careers, for women, in the world. It therefore astounds me that laws and regulations have not been put in place to ensure that those women who choose to take up such an occupation are not taken better care of. We should stop seeing prostitutes as a problem. I feel the problem is those who exploit and bully these vulnerable people, namely 'pimps'.  Prostitution, like gambling, alcohol drinking, drug taking, and any other vice you can name, will carry on, legal or illegal. People want it, it is their personal choice to have it or not. Illegality simply drives it underground where it is controlled by harsh penalties under the law, and by the always-violent practitioners of organised crime. What is it to you whether a man visits a prostitute? Legal prostitution will be safer health-wise for the prostitutes and their clients. Women will not be controlled by a pimp but by a form of licensing, designed not to prohibit but to improve their services.  Prostitution is generally a last resort for women who have no other means to raise the money they need. I suspect that only for a minority is it a career choice taken in preference to other more conventional alternatives. As such it would be a decent thing to decriminalise it, but taxing it would be immoral and might be taken to indicate that the state approves - which I certainly hope it doesn't.  Prostitution is already legal here in Switzerland. If men want to pay for it, and women want to sell it...what's the problem?  Prostitution should be made legal but mainly to protect the women and try to control the spread of disease. If this country only legalises it for reasons of boosting the economy then why not legalise drugs as well why we're at it?  No amount of regulation will prevent prostitution from taking place, it should be accepted as an inevitable feature of society and the government should maximise this latent revenue potential, the same argument could also be applied to other morally sensitive industries, such as drug manufacture and sales.  Does this mean that we will have to report the amount of times we have sex to the Inland Revenue? With my wife they'll owe me money at the end of the year.  Of course prostitution should be legalised. If someone decides to use their body as their means of income, that is their choice. They are providing a service which is obviously wanted or prostitution would have died out years ago. No one has a moral right to dictate what a person can and cannot do with their own body and nor does anyone deserve to be reviled, abused or put in danger because of their choice of profession.  No, it shouldn't be legalised so the taxman can take his share! It should be legalised because the government has no right to tell people over 18 what to do with their bodies!  The issue of prostitution has always been 'hush-hush', a real taboo subject. Yet, it's probably one of the oldest traditions in the world. I wonder what it is about it that makes us squirm when the issue is raised. As our common knowledge now dictates, Japan has long been famous for prostitution - Geisha. Even here, the morals dictate that the job itself is something that we should all be ashamed of. However, as with all other pressing issues, such as the legalisation of soft drugs and euthanasia, it remains an ever-present discussion point. There are always women who feel compelled to work as a prostitute, and as long as the woman is not being exploited, I would regard it as another profession.  Prostitution should definitely be legalised as soon as possible. Not only will it then be taxable, but also the people who choose to work in this profession will be able to do so in safety. Prostitution is the oldest profession and can never be stopped, so surely the best thing to do is regulate it, and bring it above ground.      Can anyone say that prostitution is a perfectly moral act? For those who argue in favour of legalisation because it can't be stopped, no law in the world is going to stop killing or most other crimes, either. Is this reason enough to legalise it?  I think the legalisation of this service is an excellent idea. Not only will it stop me from having to drive along dodgy streets at night, but it would also help in making the whole thing safer both for the service provider and the client. Plus, they may get better looking if it becomes a legitimate business.  There are lots of arguments for and against legalisation. It's a finely balanced argument, but I personally come out in favour of legalisation, which would allow regulation and safeguards to protect both prostitutes and their clients. But there is one thing I'm absolutely sure about and that is that economic considerations and the prospect of tax revenues should play no part in the debate. Let's not forget we are talking about people's lives. The decision should be based solely on the consequences on the quality of life of prostitutes, their clients, and society at large.  It is frightening that anyone should propose that the law should be framed around what is good for the Treasury. The legal status of prostitution, and anything else for that matter, should be decided on the basis of whether it is moral, whether it benefits society as a whole more to be o be legal or not, and whether it infringes peoples rights more if legal or not. If the Treasury had control, no doubt everything would be legal (except tax evasion) and the taxman would save having to pay for police and courts.  At the end of the day this is the oldest profession in the world. Will someone please acknowledge this and legalise it and give the police time to tackle real crime.  Legalise it but for God's sake don't tax it! As soon as the government get involved we can be sure prostitution will die out.  Legalising and thus controlling prostitution, raises revenue, enables health & safety issues, breaks (or weakens) drug links, makes the trade more transparent, fixes rates, cleans up the act, and significantly reduces the risk of young people being violently abused, or imprisoned in a spiral of moral, physical, social and fiscal degeneration. Morally its awkward, but I think a utilitarian approach is called for.  Not only the Treasury would benefit. So would the public, there could be consumer protection, for example. And indeed, so would the workforce: they could have social protection, and would no longer have to be vulnerable to criminals. In addition, legal competition might significantly reduce illegal immigration and the trade in young women.  Why not? The government is fighting a losing battle anyway. In Finland prostitution is legal - having a pimp is illegal, and I don't see why it shouldn't be the same here. If a woman wishes to sell her body then who are we to stop her?  Prostitution is already legal in the UK. It's just that most of the activities surrounding prostitution are illegal. The frightening subject is the increased white slave trade. If the activities surrounding prostitution were legalised it would be easier to protect prostitutes under the law because then they would no longer be in fear of prosecution themselves.  We live in a supposedly free and democratic society so as long as no harm is being done, prostitutes, like the rest of us, should have the right to live as they choose. Besides prostitutes are simply supplying a demand and selling a product just like any other. Who are we to impose our morals and beliefs on others?      In the 21st century we should wake up to human nature and accept prostitution. A legalised and controlled industry that generates income from taxes makes more sense than wasting taxpayers' money on a crime that will never be eradicated.  The other question to be asked first is: Is prostitution a job?. If the answer is yes then prostitutes should be taxed in the same way that any other hard working self-employed person does. How would the government regulate and collect the tax? How would they measure the prostitute's ability to work? Interesting job for someone out there...  This is long overdue. Affairs of contract between two consenting adults are of nobody else's concern. People will not be dictated to by self-appointed moral guardians who would not personally be involved in this anyway, and so the moral issue is irrelevant. Issues such as the presence of underage girls on the      I'm rather fed up of people inflicting their morals on me! Prostitution is the sticky end of the skin trade, so where do you draw the line. No more Page 3 girls? Ban bikinis. I know, make women wear head to toe shawls. Either end of the scale seems a tad excessive to me, but that's just me! If you don't like it, don't do it! The advantage of legalising it (much like drugs) is that it makes it easier to regulate, and I'm all for that!      Yes, this is a moral issue. It is immoral for woman to sell their bodies for money whether by consent or mostly not. Child labour is deemed immoral, and likewise smoking heroin yet in both cases they could be deemed the individual's decision in part. At the end of the day the difficult comes from an individual's perception of whether this ""work"" is moral or immoral. This is the core of the matter. I would judge any work that involves physical/ sexual abuse as immoral.      The idea of legalising prostitution has its merits. Our jails would not be constantly filled with prostitutes and pimps, hence less tax dollars we the people would have to spend to get them and hold them in prison. But in the long term, legalising prostitution could only help eliminate the dangers of prostitution if the legalisation law also included adequate protection for these prostitutes. Set a legal age for prostitution and enforce it strictly to control and eliminate the number of underage prostitutes. Prosecute strongly those ""pimps"" that use underage persons for prostitution. Give prostitutes the same full protection under the law as other citizens have. And yes, from a financial standpoint tax prostitution for added revenue and to help cover the costs of protecting prostitutes.      Take a look at Holland here they tried make it as a ""normal profession with normal working conditions, with disastrous consequences i.e. Illegal prostitutes flourished and a high trade in eastern European women. The legalised brothels are losing business to the illegal pimps, who are recruiting women from the eastern block, promising the earth and forcing them to work as prostitutes. A black market will always exist, it is exercising control that is an issue.      It seems that governments haven't looked into the legalisation of prostitution mostly because of conservatism and the Christian constituencies that support them. The legalisation would pose problems but also a number of benefits - able to regulate health standards etc. Prostitutes -both women and men - are used and abused and legalising their trade could protect them from arbitrary arrest (they get arrested but those who go after their services don't) and from abuse by their ""pimps"", plus the tax benefits. Keeping the control of this sector of the economy, namely the sex trade, out of the hands of criminals could result in better lives for the people involved.      Like it or not, legal or not, prostitution has always been around and is here to stay. What is annoying is that legal powers can do too little to stop the kerb crawling or the pavement touts, female or male. Unfortunately, all too often, prostitution is the only means of earning cash. If prostitution is going to be legalised then strict regulations should be in force to protect those who offer their services and customers alike.      Why not look at the examples of places where prostitution has already been legalised. One such example is the rural counties of Nevada. The two biggest areas are some 80 miles from Las Vegas and some 60 miles from Reno, both out in the desert. Brothels there are clean safe and well regulated. The counties license the brothels and the girls, and receive tax revenue on the proceeds. The girls get a safe place to work free from physical harm. By contrast in the built-up areas of Las Vegas and Reno, where it is not legal, you find typical scenes of streetwalkers who suffer from all the abuse and harassment familiar in most cities. Seems that legalised operations are clearly the way to go.      How can we teach our children to respect themselves and others when all the time we are removing any sense of value from what it means to be human. I fail to see how legalising prostitution will help this. In our consumer-obsessed society we should draw the line at promoting people as ""product"". Didn't we abolish slavery for the same reason? Whether consensual or not, we should not support laws that allow the sale of people as if buying a loaf of bread.      In Canberra, where I live, prostitution has been legalised with regulated brothels only allowed in industrial precincts. The sex-workers - both female AND male receive regular health check-ups and they pay their taxes. The brothels are often owned and run by the workers themselves (without the pimps and other parasites). The sky hasn't fallen in and there are no street-walkers. Legalisation of itself is no panacea for problems of drug dependency, poverty and unemployment. These are much greater systemic issues which no western society has yet to successfully deal with. But at least the police are freed to chase real criminals.      If you want to legalise prostitution, before you vote ""yes"" take a trip to the Netherlands. You will see the shocking degradation of a culture which includes legalisation of prostitution, among other things. Their TV reflects a culture of moral degradation. I feel embarrassed for the Dutch people. I wouldn't wish this on any country. Elizabeth D.      Why do the Government look at the profit margin, not the issues involved. The slave trade was based on this and so is the drugs trade. Next they will want to legalise drugs so they can make a profit rather than the dealers. Women should be allowed to undertake any activity they wish so should men. Any moral issues should not be addressed by the public at large but rather by those concerned      The current system, where prostitution is illegal, is inherently sexist as the hookers are jailed and fined, yet the johns are not. Their pimps are rarely hauled up before the courts either. Even if prostitution is never made legal, the laws that make it a crime should be evenly applied.      We have to be pragmatic. Prostitution exists so ergo there's a demand for it. Not all married people (or single people for that matter) enjoy an ideal sex life with their partners. Prostitution fills a genuine need and prostitutes deserve protection from abuse - legalisation could provide this protection.      Legalise it and tax it. Then use the proceeds to offer as many of the women as possible a way out of this degrading and miserable lifestyle. Surely some of them will jump at the chance to do something else.      For those who think legalising prostitution is a solution: my state has legalised it. But brothels still have problems with underage girls, drugs and violence. Only now it's even harder to stop 'cos the perpetrators can play hide-and-seek with the law. And desperate women still solicit along some streets. So I'm not sure what legislation has achieved. But then again, as long as it's profitable, who cares?      Prostitution is immoral and unethical. Society needs to realise that we are human beings who can judge between right or wrong. And prostitution is dead wrong anywhere.      Prohibition should be made illegal.      This is not a moral issue, since consent is given by both parties; it is not an economic issue, though there may be taxable advantages for the Government; it's about treating people decently as humans. I agree with Zoe UK. When are we going to stop living in the dark ages? Get it legalised and controlled.      Don't legalise it for health reasons, or to tax it. Legalise it because it is right and proper that free people in a free country should be able to choose what they do.      In my country prostitution is illegal, but I think it has been a recognised profession for thousands of years. It should be legalised and regulated for health reasons. It may never be prestigious, but to deny that it occurs does not get rid of the issue.      Prostitution has all its worst contexts. It negatively affects us in our social relationships. If it exists, it could have existed out of shame and out of guilt in the mind. To legalize it means society is accepting it as an institution and supporting the act. More degrading than legalizing is when governments take money out of the practice of prostitution. This is a form of being an accomplice to this act. Rationalizing it form making tax revenue out of it, is settling for the final power of money at all opportune moments of collecting money. Should money be the ultimate rationale for the context of our lives?      I think we should legalise prostitution, not because it would generate money, but it will get them off our streets and into secure houses where they could have health checks etc. We will never stamp out prostitution, this has been going on since the dark ages, but if we're in control of it maybe these men and women will think twice and go out and get a proper job instead.      Keeping prostitution illegal will not result in its elimination, so it might as well be decriminalized. Further, a tax upon it can be used to fund its regulation so that it will not unduly spread disease. Beyond this, many of the girls who become prostitutes need drug or alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation programs, which are difficult to get into now, due to poor government funding. A tax upon prostitution could be used to fully fund these programs. At present, prostitutes must bribe the police to leave them alone, so we already have a tax upon prostitutes - albeit an illegal tax - which goes directly into the pockets of police and organized crime. Were this money taxed away and recycled into rehabilitation programs, the girls might get some real good out of their ill-gotten loot.      I agree with Anthony's (UK) remarks. He is right, if someone is not happy with his sexual life, then he and his wife should take initiative to find the solution. To visit prostitutes is not a solution, but it would bring more distance between husband and wife.      How much the human being has gone down in their morality and spirituality even to think of such a devilish act making legalized. Make the law in such a way that it will promote loyalty of a husband to his wife and wife to her husband. Human being are not just meat!      Prostitution should be legalized. In most cases this situation is based on poverty. Why is it that if a single mother sells her body to feed her young children is illegal and if it is done in Hollywood it is entertainment. Is that because it is done by the rich?      What harm is there if someone wants to use his or her body to earn a bit of cash? We all sell our bodies in different ways for work, so let the prostitutes do the same. We should not base our laws on some people's religious doctrines.      No matter how much money it may make from taxes we have to remember that it may also lead to an increase in the amount of health and social care demanded. Let's face it, if prostitution were legalised then it increases the chances of spreading STD's and pregnancy, even if those who are soliciting are trying to do it safe, these things happen. These two circumstances would be most felt in the NHS during health checks and they could lead to a big demand on NHS funding. HIV alone is a very expensive condition to treat, and should we really be letting ourselves as a society increase the risk of it spreading?      It does not matter what we think about it. Eventually the EU will give us our orders and the matter will be settled.     In my country, prostitution is still a taboo issue which do not generate much talk. In my personal opinion, I think such taboos should stop and people should acknowledge the fact that it is also an occupation as well. The stigma that attaches itself to prostitution should be removed and the people working in the industry should deserve some form of recognition and respect.      I just think that if the largest number of a prostitute's clients are married men, then it can't be right to want to encourage an activity which allows them to access sexual gratification, to the detriment of his wife and the women selling her body for sex. Surely, if he's not happy in his sex life with his wife he should be taking the initiative in finding out how they can be happy, together, rather than going elsewhere. I mean, what sort of love is that?     Prostitution equates humans to animals who do not know the relationships and sentiments. After gaining so many instincts of civilisations, talent and social habits man has started going far behind the animals by first of all having this social evils like prostitution in their society and then by legalising it.      I am ashamed of humans, they are defying the standards of humanity.      Legalise prostitution, because this would most probably put an end to the most abusive and degrading aspects of this type of ""trade"". Do not tax it because no government should enrich itself through it. Prostitution remains a sad and often involuntary activity, but it does exist and will exist for much longer, the persons involved in it are not doing the regular, 9 to 5, tax paying job though. Legalisation without taxation would benefit those who need it the most: the prostitutes, and the prostitutes only. Not the state, not the pimp and not the customer.      Yes, both male and female prostitution should be legalised and regulated as in Germany. There should be regular medical checks, licences, and safe brothels - probably near motorway junctions - with high-quality ""hotel"" facilities and proper protection for client and provider. It is funny how inner-city areas are the focus of this trade with drugs and pimps. Levy a flat-rate tax as the Germans do and proper medical examinations.      This really is not a radical step, but rather pass? - if only our politicians were more in touch with normal people!      The people who argue against legalising prostitution all seem to be under the impression that keeping an activity illegal is actually effective. I mean only someone who lives in a bubble complains that he wants prostitution banned because he does not want his children to grow up seeing prostitutes on the corner of his street.     By legalising the second oldest profession in the world, you could curb the criminal element which is the real threat. It's not an admission of failure, which would mean you are imposing your values on someone else.      Fact is prostitutes are already, in England and elsewhere, on the corner of many streets, controlled and mistreated by pimps, and abused by their customers. By legalising and regulating prostitution, we would mandate that the business be confined to particular districts, and not have them be in front of children everywhere.      It is interesting to see the views of those who condemn (for moral reasons) the proposed ""legalisation"" of prostitution. All too often these people do not give a damn how the poor and disadvantaged in this society live. How often have these people taken an interest in how the ""other half"" lives? How much do they know about the hard oppressive reality that leaves some women with no other option but to become whores? If these moral guardians would actually fight the good fight and campaign against grinding poverty, an unjust economic system etc then the problem wouldn't exist to begin with.      I am a religious Muslim. I am strongly opposed to prostitution, but can some one tell me what has society gained by making prostitution illegal? I think that you either really get tough on prostitution and eliminate all who are involved in the sex trade, or you legalise it. But hanging in the middle is stupid and only makes the problem worse.      Don't legalise it for tax purposes, legalise it so that the people in the business can get their basic human rights - healthcare, education, police protection etc - without stigma and fear of losing homes, children, livelihood, community respect...      P.S. Why are so many of the messages here from men?     Legalise it and tax it...BUT only if the government use all the revenues to fight under-age prostitution and sex slavery e.g. setting up a national network of refuge centres for the above, and creating a powerful and all-embracing educational programme.     Slavery was also profitable and taxable.      Prostitution is never going to go away. It is after all ""the oldest profession in the world"" whether we like it or not it is here to stay. Therefore, to help both the health of the girls who earn a living in the trade and take the control and money away from the criminal element that currently gain the benefits from the trade, we should legalise it using a system of licensing, where only safe houses could be used with proprietors who do not have criminal records.      After watching a programme on vice, I think some sort legalisation would be beneficial to the prostitutes. I realise that to some people this business is disgusting and should be stopped, unfortunately this is one of the oldest games going. There will always be men who prefer to pay for their sex for whatever reason. Some sort of regulation would not only raise some money but would offer some protection to the women involved. It is no good shutting your eyes to this problem, as it will always exist.      I fail to see that what two consenting adults do in private is any more the government's business if it involves money than it is if it doesn't.      In the German town where I live (c500,000 inhabitants) there are prostitutes, but unless you choose to go down the small one-way street where all the brothels are, you never are bothered by them. Also, although there are surely many, many things wrong with the German prostitution trade (the exploitation of female illegal immigrants for example), at least the brothels are where the police and social services can get at them.      Its sad to see that most of the comments on this issue are from men and that most suggest legalising a behaviour that degrades women and encourages the sexual objectification of women that is so common everywhere else in society today. No decent man should favour buying women's bodies for their sexual amusement.      Please don't humiliate womanhood - they are our mothers.      An interesting debate but prostitution is not illegal. What is illegal is soliciting, living off immoral earnings and Kerb crawling. These three offences should stay to prevent widespread soliciting as cities like London saw up to the 1960's. If people want to pay for sex let them but lets keep it off our streets.      If prostitution is truly an abhorrent practice that is dangerous and degrading for those involved, then surely some positive action should be taken by the society in which this practice exists.      Legalising prostitution and regulating the working conditions of those individuals concerned (whatever gender they might be) would provide a safety net for a part of society that is currently extremely vulnerable to abuse. Surely the aim of society is to provide a safe and nurturing environment for its citizens. I would see the legalisation and regulation of prostitution to be a step in this direction.      The question of legalisation versus decriminalisation is another matter, and a well thought out paper on this is available at http://www.sfc.org.uk/docs/green.htmlegalisatio K    Prostitution, like all other human activities, has a ""supply"" side (the economic disadvantaged who see no other alternative) and a ""demand"" side (those prepared and able to pay to sate their sexual desires). Whether one legalises it or not, those two factors will remain ... as they always have. Addressing these core factors would seem to be a nobler goal than playing with the semantics of the delivery system!      Protecting the prostitutes doesn't mean protecting the pimps. I say it should be legalised. Sexual activity isn't a criminal offence, providing there is consent by both parties. Not offering a safe haven or refugee is far more dangerous and I would say more deplorable than the act itself. Additionally, prostitution is the oldest profession in the world and it is not something that will go away.      As we all know and see, everything is taxed so why not tax prostitutes who earn very well. I think to make it fair they should be taxed. No power in the world can stop prostitution so legalising them is another important issue to keep the society balanced.      No, never. It is an immoral way of dealing with the problem of female poverty and encourages exploitation of women and bad behaviour among men. Economic arguments in favour merely camouflage already thinly-disguised selfishness and lust. It shows that our society is more, not less, male chauvinist. So much for the 'sexual revolution'.      One man's garbage is another man's treasure. Why should one person impose his/ her morals on another? Laws should not be enacted to control a persons morals. Legalise it, tax it, and make it conform to a set of regulations like any other business.      I refuse to have my son grow up with this sort of filth at the end of my street. I'm also sure that I'm not alone, and will take whatever action I have to, to ensure there are no brothels near where I live. As a parent I have an obligation to protect my child from this filth. I don't care where they do what they do, but I can assure you that I will not tolerate any intrusion of my right to enjoy my life without this being thrust into my face at every street corner. The very concept of it being legal (and the taboo) will increase peoples desire to get some of the action. Its filth and that's the bottom line.      Prostitution serves a legitimate purpose. Not everyone is married, and not every married person has a spouse who is interested in sex. Nor is every single person young and attractive. So there are those for whom prostitution is the only way to enjoy any sex at all. What's wrong with that?      The arguments against prostitution being legalised are generally confused. The only thing that makes prostitution illegal is that you pay for it. If you don't pay for it, it is legal, even though you may be violating just as many rules of morality by having sex for free outside of marriage. So unless we are going to criminalise adultery, we have no reason to criminalise prostitution.      Legalise it! It is just another job. We must admit that sex is pleasurable. When something is pleasurable you will find plenty of custom. Legalise it, like the Netherlands and Germany have done. The ladies can become legitimate taxpayers and can get on with their lives with dignity. If necessary, lets have a referendum.      Great idea, whilst there at it, why not make those who visit prostitutes, pay for their medical care when they catch venereal diseases. If they can afford a prostitute, they can afford to pay for this as well. I wonder how much of a drain this is on the NHS every year.      Yes, many prostitutes are only involved because of other problems in their life, i.e. drug addiction. In its present unlicensed format it is a dangerous environment for them that perpetuates and positively encourages crime, ritual abuse, exploitation, deceit, and transmission of life threatening disease. License it, tax it, and make it safer for all those involved, and also stop people who have other problems getting involved.      Leave the morals to the people who partake in the activity. All you moral do-gooders should learn to mind your own business! Plus the extra money from taxes would be quite useful for the Government too.      There are efforts by many cities and states in the US to try and get women out of prostitution. If prostitution is legalised then governments will have no incentive to help these women escape from this life because the tax benefits will be too great.      In many of the responses people claimed that legalisation will end sex slavery. It will not. It will actually increase the problem due to higher demand by men who no longer fear arrest. Authorities will have no way to tell whether prostitution is a choice or not. The tax incentives may actually encourage the police and government to look the other way when sex slavery does occur, which is what happens in many countries especially Eastern Europe.      What is happening in our country when such a question is being raised? The law in a civilised country should protect the weak and marginalised in society and be intrinsically ethical in its nature. Vulnerable women must be protected by the law from being manipulated and dominated by abusive profiteers and immoral men who perpetuate the prostitution trade. It would therefore be a crime against human rights and betrayal of the national conscience if prostitution were legalised. However, it should be those who employ and use prostitutes who should be severely punished by the law, but not the prostitutes themselves who should be regarded with compassion.      Prostitution is already legal. In your country you call it Parliament, in ours, we call it Congress.      Yes legalise it. How can people compare prostitution to murder and burglary. Prostitution is consenting sex for money, whereas I am sure that most people do not consent to be murdered or burgled!      Prostitution should be legalised. However, to prevent STDs prostitutes should be certified periodically by getting a health check. Thus the legal prostitutes would be the ones who passed the exam.      I am surprised that no-one has yet protested at this becoming yet another example of women being dehumanised into sex-objects to be bought and used in the market. And where does this leave marriage, faithfulness and commitment, let alone the risk of the spread of disease?      Like Wyatt Bell I am also a transplanted Englishman living in the Netherlands. Mr Bell's points are spot-on. I just wonder if the vocal minority who set themselves up as social and moral guardians in England will EVER bow to the inevitable and legalise the oldest profession - I think not.      What I've seen in Amsterdam is nothing I'd be proud of having in my own home town. If the Netherlands is the benchmark by which to judge the effects of legalised prostitution - it gets the ""no thank-you"" from me.      Interesting that almost all of the responses come from men! And, that they want it legalised. Wonder why? But legalised it should be and should have been a long time ago for everybody's sakes, and safety.      The West has the audacity to criticise the Talban when it is clear to see who is manipulating women. Women are protected under Islam whereas it is clear to see that they are oppressed under Western ideologies.      Prostitutes are expensive enough as it is. Goodness knows how I'll be able to afford them if they whack 17.5% VAT on as well.      Legalising prostitution for tax purposes is doing a good thing with the wrong intention. But, taxing is also necessary to make prostitution respectable and legitimate like other professions. Besides, it should be illegal for men or women to act as a pimp. Let this service develop into an art as geishas have done in Japan. They might solve the ""stress"" problem the world is facing, and balance the pain of life to some extent for some.      Legalise it because people have a right to make private contact with other consenting adults. I do not think that, in a modern world, laws should be used to protect morals, particularly as the morals come from a bygone era where the church and religion had far too much say in peoples lives.      Legalisation is not a solution it is an admission of failure. Society has failed to halt the moral degradation that has over-run the streets. What is the solution? If you cannot beat them join them - typical from a society whose leaders ""lead by example"". Legalisation will lead to the increase of the activity.      And why not...the amount of abuse and violence that most prostitutes take from their pimps is disgusting, people have to remember that most prostitutes choose this way of life as they have no other choices or haven't seen any other avenues in life to go down.      As far as I can see, the arguments for legalising it are immense: safer for the girls, frees up the police, stops people being branded as criminals for what is really a ""moral"" crime. The only thing I can see against it is that the government risks offending the ""moral"" minority.      I see all the usual tired old arguments being wheeled out here. ""Oldest profession in the world."" Says who? How do they know and why should that make any difference anyway? ""Only 2 people are involved"". Really? If a married man goes to see a prostitute I would suggest at least 3 adults are involved, are they not? ""The moral issue is irrelevant."" I would suggest that a society that sees the selling of sex as a mere commodity is a society that is rapidly losing sight of the sense of family and the specialness of sex within the context of a loving and meaningful relationship, and that ought to concern us all. ""Legalising it will stop the criminal element being involved"". How is this supposed to work exactly? It's legal to sell tobacco in shops for example, but that doesn't stop a thriving black market in cigarettes      Legalise it. Takes the danger and criminality out of it. Law should reflect society, not an Ann Widdecombe wish list.      In a world where we are fast losing are moral values it wont be long before the things that we know to be wrong today will be right tomorrow. It shouldn't be difficult for anyone to see how the standards of the world have change so much in the last few years or even months. Those who argue, ""it can't be stopped so legalise it"", have you thought of the other things such as drugs, theft, killings that can't be stopped as being legalised soon. We ought to be ready for that too.      Imagine the potential. Mega brothels offering salaries and other employee benefits. Some entrepreneur could really do something with a change in the law on this. Virgin?      It should be eliminated rather than legalizing it.      I hope that those who want to see this trade legalised will also be happy to have a brothel-house at each end of their street, with red neon lights proclaiming their business. This is what we have in certain parts of Brussels. I feel sorry for the poor kids in those areas who must be asking their parents: What are all the red lights for? Why are all those men going in and out of those houses? What are they doing there? If you vote for legalisation, you must be sure you'll know what to tell your kids when they start asking these questions.      I assume that prostitutes, if legalized, would not be caught by the new IR35 legislation, and would therefore be able to claim back courses on self training more easily than I, a computer consultant, can.      Stop saying prostitution should be legal, PROSTITUTION IS LEGAL! What is not legal is publicly soliciting sexual services. More than one girl working on a premises is also illegal. So if you want a threesome I guess you better get them to come to your place! "
HOC HOC-LX 9.65 " I think it is a good idea for the retirement age to be scrapped. With people living longer and wishing to continue to work should be given the choice. Besides, with Europe's working population shrinking, it can only be a good thing. Seems to me there is no other way for Europe to cope and perhaps it would be a good thing for the elderly who wish to keep active to stay active.      With age comes experience, with experience comes knowledge and efficiency. Ban the retirement age, let the individual decide.      In an advanced country such as the UK, in order to have ""full employment"" people should share the available work; i.e. they should each work for (say) 3 or 4 days per week. Retirement should then come easily (again to release jobs for younger people) and that retirement should be welcomed.      The only people who truly want to work ""all hours that God sends, and until they drop"" tend to have rewarding, satisfying and highly paid, dare I say ""easy"" jobs, They are simply greedy. I wonder whether they would be prepared to carry on working for ""nil pay"". Those in society who have ""boring, low-paid and heavy work"" type jobs look forward to their retirement in order to escape from the daily grind.      I think it is important to be both physically and mentally active in later life. For some this means pursuing hobbies and leisure activities and for others the pleasure is received from working. I don't think there should be a compulsory retirement age, work is very much an individual and personal decision. It is better to have a choice than to have no choice at all.      I'm 40. I'm better at my chosen profession now then I was in my 20 and 30's. I can only see my skills improving with age. So as long as I'm fit and well I see no reason why I should be forced into retirement at the age of 65      Having lived and worked in the United States for 5 years the ageism that exists in the UK seems appalling. In the U.S. it is illegal to advertise a position with age restrictions, unless they are relevant to the job. Hiring procedures must then be free of discrimination to prevent any covert rejections. Many Americans seem to enjoy their work, and in these days of changing career paths, are on to their third or fourth career by the time they get into their seventies. People who are enjoying their work see retirement as the waste of time. I am sad to read so many comments from people who are weighed down by daily existence. I would say, change your job, but I suppose they can't, they are too old. It is high time the UK bought an end to ageism in employment practises and freed up the market place to let people pursue different employment paths, whatever their age.      I remember the years of high unemployment in the early eighties when they wanted to reduce the retirement age so that school leavers would have jobs to go to, however, now we have record low unemployment and there are not enough workers to fill the gaps, they start talking about raising the age of retirement - strange that isn't it?.      My father is 61 years old and has been facing ageism for the last few years. he is willing to work and is highly qualified. He has even jumped on the IT bandwagon and learned programming skills. Will anyone employ him? Not likely. I'm all in favour of this kind of legislation.      Employers find excuses to get rid of employees that they no longer want regardless of age. They don't wait until legal retirement age. How many middle-aged workers have been thrown onto the scrap heap. Moves to abolish the legal retirement age may enable employers to keep the few with desirable skills that they cannot replace, but it will do nothing for the rest of us.      I find it sad that people are looking to retirement to end the daily grind so they can enjoy life. If you don't like your job do something you do enjoy. I plan to work at my own endeavours until I am way beyond 65. But I will work on my terms.      Regrettably many of us now in our fifties have no choice but to work until our seventies or until we drop. That is because the last Tory government's mishandling of the country's economy, in particular the foolish attempt to shadow the Deutschmark, in the late 80s and early 90s destroyed our businesses and long-term retirement plans. We now have to make up what we lost, or rather what was taken from us.      What is all this nonsense about age. I work on short to medium-term interim assignments and my age is seen as a positive because people recognise that this brings with it a wide range of skills, a great deal of ability and masses of experience. In addition, each assignment you undertake adds to those factors. You can never stop learning and age should not be a factor. I want to continue for as long as my health allows it.      Nick Strugnell, UK      Legislation should be introduced to combat the rampant ageism of UK employers. I find it incredible that jobs ads routinely specify an age range. Compare to the US where this behaviour is completely illegal, and people do not even put their date of birth on CVs and job applications.      Not much point in raising or doing away with the compulsory retirement age when ageism is so rife that you're lucky to get another job after 40, or even younger. It would be better to ban ""ageism"" altogether, and stamp down hard on employers who use it.      The current retirement system is set up for conditions of the early to middle 20th century. For the majority of workers (if they reached it at all) it involved a couple of years grace to die from the effects of their working life. But longevity has greatly increased, and is likely to increase much more radically over the next few decades. So the retirement age starts to look too low. Yet, on the other hand, we can't find enough employment. We need well-off consumers, perhaps more than we do workers. Our economy suffers from a demand shortage, not a supply shortage. I think that in the 21st century will have to think quite radically about the way our lives progress. A person who lives a couple of centuries will, more than ever, need more than one career. I suspect retirement may turn into a kind of extended holiday between careers.      Whether retirement is made compulsory is immaterial. What really needs to be addressed are the gap years between when one is forced to leave one's employment, say at 60, to the time state pension can be claimed at 65 as not every company offers a pension and release scheme. What companies can do for those who have reached retirement age is to offer optional part-time or reduced hours employment so that the new younger intake can benefit from their seniors' experience. Also, I hasten to add, there are considerable numbers of those past 65 years old still occupying senior executive positions in a lot of major companies - shame the non-executive workforce is not treated the same.      I am 51 and as fit as 20, both mentally and physically. I guess the great majority feel the same. I want to work as long as I feel I wish. Show me one younger person with my experience: six languages, 40 countries during the last 20 years. Any corporation should think about this. We have the experience and maturity that only the years give. Down with this discrimination of mature people!      Perhaps we can adopt a flexible shift of working patterns appropriate to the health, desire and ability of individuals at any age Peter Wilkins, Canada I am not sure that retirement equals paradise (as some seem to expect). While I would look forward to more time flexibility, I am sure that withdrawal from the ""workforce"" has negative effects on the mind and body. I am sure I want to stay involved in a meaningful role as an active participant in work and society (not merely a volunteer or mentor).      I agree that there should be a flexible plan where people can make choices during their life on if, how and when they retire. Perhaps we can adopt a flexible shift of working patterns appropriate to the health, desire and ability of individuals at any age - even the ability to take a year or two sabbatical in lieu of an early retirement. Surely that would be a tonic for many who need a break from work, but not (yet) retire.      This is the best news I have heard in years. I lived in the USA for over 14 years, where age discrimination is illegal. When I returned to the UK in 1996, I was confronted with this archaic legislation. I will be 50 next week and I am very happy this situation is being forced on the UK Government. Recently, I applied for a job back in the UK. I had removed my date of birth from my CV and when the head-hunter asked me for this information, I refused to give it. Needless to say, my application came to an abrupt end.      My company gives both men and women their pensions at 60. I have just under two years to go. I don't want to retire, so I shall be looking for another job - I am fit and haven't had a days illness is the last year. I think its wrong to force me to leave.      We all decay at different rates, scrap the retirement age.      Several previous comments refer to the economy (or the young) ""supporting"" the retired population. I am over sixty, and have been paying various forms of state and private pension contributions for the past forty years. I regard that as supporting myself! Incidentally, I shall know when I become unable to contribute to some company's well-being. Until then, I want to make up my own mind whether I want to go on being employed.      Taking John B's point a little further, there are plenty of HR and recruitment ""professionals"" who think that anyone over 35 is past it. I see too many companies who rely heavily on under-25's, who are often ""full of knowledge, but short of wisdom"", but who won't keep or take on more mature staff because they have adopted the ""cult of youth"" approach - ""oldies are too slow to learn new skills, too expensive, uncommitted etc"" - all of which is total rubbish. Any company that genuinely cares about growth should value the benefits that age and experience can bring - and yes, older people are often much more reliable and therefore cost-effective than ""cheap"" youngsters. We should all be allowed the choice of working after 65 - grey power rules!      The truth of the matter is that people are choosing either to have their children later in life or not to have children at all! In economic terms this means that there will soon be a large majority of people over 60 who are retired and paying less or no tax. If as a nation we are not replacing these taxpayers we cannot afford to pay pensions, NHS etc, at the present level. So it therefore makes sound economic sense to let people work for longer if they so choose. The Government cannot do without us wrinklies and they have just caught on to that fact!!      As someone who works in recruitment, I see age issues all the time. If a senior manager recruits an older person who does not work out, they will pay the price. If they recruit a younger person, with the same result, the penalty is less because they are being seen to develop future management and the candidate will also have (obliquely) benefited from the experience. Age demographics will alter this process as those managers become older and find themselves in the reverse situation in a few years time.      There is an additional factor of economics in the debate about extending the retirement age. When there are more jobs than younger people to fill them, employers will be forced to abandon ageism, and some people will work beyond the retirement age, either because pensions will be inadequate or because they want to keep busy. As a result of that ageism I now have a job rather than a satisfying career, so I hope that I will be able to retire, but remain healthy enough to do things that interest me, such as charity work and my currently part-time writing of feature articles for business magazines. Employers may then be begging for staff, but I want to be able to remind them that when I was available, they thought me too old.      Nobody would talk about raising the retirement age if it wasn't for the pensions crisis, and we wouldn't have that but for past under-investment in a proper pensions system to cope with the burgeoning elderly population. People should have the option to retire earlier, if they so desire - providing they have funded their pension or other sources of income - and to continue working if their value is beyond doubt. If they do wish to retire early, we should have the option of a partnership or mentoring scheme, so younger people can benefit from their knowledge and experience post-retirement.      I can't imagine anything more boring than being 'retired' for 40 or 50 years - it's the equivalent of a lifetime for some. I certainly intend to go on working until I at least feel like I'm going to drop. My husband is 20 years younger than me and I don't want, for a start, to be sitting at home for 20 years on my own waiting for him to retire.      Ageism doesn't just affect people of or near retirement age. I work in IT in the financial sector and myself and others meet ageism even at the age of 40 with some organisations (especially the human resource section) not even interested in people aged 40. Last year I spent a whole Saturday doing tests (and passing in the top 10%) for a particular investment bank and yet was not given a 2nd interview even though somebody 10 years younger who got a worse score did.      Whilst some people do want to retire at 45, people like myself wish to work until we are 80. IT is a super job environment and it keeps me young in mind and body.      In my opinion, people of a mature age should be classed with the highest respect, dignity and honour that society can give. They are a valuable source of wisdom and insight and can teach the younger generations important lessons of life. Just because someone reaches the age of 65, they are not over the hill or passed their sell-by date and should be allowed to determine whether they should retire or not. After all, they are human beings.      I believe that the government is using the EU directive to suit its aim of reducing public expenditure, the ""American way"" of minimal government, on the pretext of a more balanced work force etc. The directive surely enforces the right of individuals who choose to work after 65, not that they will be expected to.      With the demographic changes we are witnessing, I think it is necessary to consider raising the age of retirement. Individuals should not be forced to retire at the age of 65. It should be a personal choice. If we do not exercise more flexibility about retirement ages, the tax burden on those of working age will become unbearable, as they support an ageing population.      Judging by some of these responses, the knee-jerk anti-Government, eurosceptic response is yet again prevalent. It isn't suggesting people should be forced to carry on working beyond retirement age, just that if they choose to they can. Many older people enjoy the jobs they do, and if they're good at doing it why should anybody put a stop to that?      Industry is already full of people in on the job retirement - often in fairly senior positions. I don't blame them for this and hope to do it myself when I reach 50. Allowing me to just sit around taking the money well into my 80's is good news for me but I don't think industry will do too well out of it. It's just another scam by the government who are panicking about pension bills!      In an age when most people's retirement pensions are woefully inadequate for their needs, because of job mobility and when there are insufficient tax inputs to provide a public pension, there needs to be an alternative. Work is far preferable to genteel poverty, in my book!      Why do we have to have a fixed term of employment that ends at 60/65? It would be better to have a flexible attitude to working life, with taxation/pension plans flexible enough to allow people to take time off at any point during their lifetime to enjoy children, travel, charitable work - whatever - rather than having to wait until the age of retirement, whenever that might be. I would LOVE to be able to take 5 years off now and then return to work with no degradation in my terms of employment - and then work on through the age of 60 if it suits me. We have too rigid an approach to working life in this country, let people contribute to the economy at any point during their lifetime if they so wish...      The retirement age should be lowered to 35. That way I get to retire next year and be happy.      I can't believe this proposal to alter the retirement age! The government are trying to sell it to us, as if we are given the freedom to make our own choices but really it is another way of getting an increased flexible labour market for the benefit of employers and for the government who can then defer payment on pensions. Who wants to work until they are 80? It's just another way for us to de-value our quality of life, to flog ourselves to death for the good of large profit making companies. I'm appalled by it all!      I want to retire ASAP, the question will be can I afford to. If you have had a good job that you enjoyed doing and that paid well why not put your skills and knowledge back into society free of charge i.e. Citizen's Advice Bureaux, adult colleges, youth centres and so on. This would help pass on skills and knowledge and keep younger people in jobs.      I am 52 years old and in the seven years I have been in my present job I have had half a day sick. Young people that I work with seem to be off sick at least every month and especially on Mondays. Could older people be fitter? Or is that they are more responsible?      Personally, having worked since leaving school, with an eight-year break to have children, I am looking forward to retirement from work - not from life. I see it as time for me - time to do and try all the things which I didn't previously have time to do. That said, if people feel they wish to carry on with a career which they find fulfilling and have the health to continue, they should be allowed to do so. I think the Government's concern would be better aimed at trying to legislate against firms who force people into redundancy simply because they've reached 50 or even younger, because they like to project a 'young' profile!      Eileen has hit the nail right on the head. How many people go to work for any other reason than to pay bills? A very fortunate few. We're spending longer and longer at work and less time having a life that means something or that achieves something. For the majority of people, work is a mundane restriction, a necessary evil. I feel pleased for those who genuinely want to work into their 70s, but I'm afraid the majority of us want to get out as soon we can and do something satisfying that goes beyond the need to exist from day to day. Quite frankly if I'm working past 50 I'll feel that I've completely wasted my life. I'm happy to work hard, but carry on working into my 70s ? How sad is that?      To suggest that at age 65 years and 0 days I suddenly become ""past it"" is as ludicrous as to suggest that at 18 years and 0 days I suddenly become a responsible adult. If I want to continue working, and am able to do so, I don't see why I shouldn't. If I subsequently want to retire I should be required to give due notice, just as I would if I resigned. I am, however, concerned that this is going to turn into a plot to force people to continue working to save on the state pension. I don't want to be forced to work when I'm in my 70s - I want the option to enjoy the fruits of my labours while I am still alive.      Ageism is rife throughout the country. I myself at the age of 35 feel it already in the City of London. I am a Senior Secretary and jobs advertised only go up to the age of 35 for a Senior Secretary. The agencies don't want to know anyone who is 35 and over. If it is bad now what will it be like when I turn 36!      Can't we just grow old gracefully, work if we want to, and then enjoy just a bit of an Indian Summer before the grim reaper forecloses on all of our carefully accumulated pensions. Whatever we do, to paraphrase W.C. Fields, life's not so bad, given the alternative!      I've worked with 30 year olds with the mental energy and attitudes normally associated with the middle aged. And I've worked with 60 year olds who are just as mentally agile and inventive as 25 year-olds. Age is simply not a good indicator of the worth of an employee.      As a 46 year old who would retire this afternoon if it was at all possible and looks at his retired friends who, now free of wage slavery, are just beginning to get their lives back again, I think this is terrible news and the thin end of the wedge. I predict that by the time I retire the state pension will still exist and may still be available to 65 year olds but will be means-tested and subject to a health check and claimants labelled ""scroungers"". I further predict that only those with inherited wealth or with a private or company pension will not have to work until they drop.      Being from the USA it was incredible to me to read in Dave Jewell's message that a firm can specify an age range in an employment listing when it has little bearing on whether a person could perform the job. If the job were that of firefighter, police, or soldier I could understand the age issue being brought in, but to not employ somebody because it isn't ""hip"" to be old is a wrong answer. Ageism is just as wrong as sexism and racism.      I'm a 37 year old women, I've been working for 21 years without a career break, I started work at 16, when I retire at 65 I will have worked for 50 years. I have got absolutely no intention of working over that age. I'll be on the beach!      I don't think there should be a fixed retirement age. I certainly don't see myself becoming suddenly useless on the day of my 60th birthday - I intend to go on working at something for the whole of my life - not necessarily because I need the money; more to satisfy my own intellectual curiosity, and to stop my brain rotting.      I am all in favour of the right people being in the workplace. However there are some people who are clearly past their prime and do not deliver value for money to an employer. In these cases, retirement (either at 65 or by making use of an early retirement programme with pension incentives) is an easy solution. If companies no longer have the right to request that certain employees retire they will either have to carry the burden or go through the sensitive area of disciplinary action (I can just see the headline 'X Company sacks 75 year old great grandmother').      I'm 55 and have worked for over 32 years with my company. As long as there is a need for what I do, and the company is doing well, I can expect to remain employed. However, if there is a downturn in the economy, which seems apparent right now, things could change. My wishes have nothing to do with how things actually work. It costs more to keep me than the younger people, who have a lot of years ahead of them. While the law says that I can't be tossed out because of my age; that will make no difference if it gets down to laying off people to save money.     There seems to be a contradiction here - on the one hand we are criticising elderly judges and doctors and suggesting they retire earlier, on the other hand we are expecting workers to work for longer and opposing age discrimination. You can't have it both ways.      Great idea save a fortune on older members of our society why let them rest after a lifetime of hard work. Yes work them until they drop close down all the homes for OAPs get out the treadmill. Back to good old Victorian values I say.      The real ageism which exists in the workplace today discriminates against people who are miles away from retirement. I recently saw a job advertisement which had an age range of 20-30. Since it was an office based sales job, there could be no medical reasons to exclude older applicants, and I think this should be against the law just as it is to discriminate on the basis of gender or race. Given the current climate of ageism, how many real opportunities would there be for 65+ year olds to earn a proper wage? All that this initiative really provides is a way to reduce the pension bill in future years. I can't imagine a bleaker old age than having to stack shelves in a supermarket at age 77 because I didn't have a pension. The government should outlaw ageism within the current employment framework to allow us to earn good money right up to retirement at 65, and further overhaul personal pension schemes to make them accessible to all, in order to tackle the state pension shortfall problem.      What we need is some form of tail-off into retirement. The economy cannot afford to support all these old people not adding to it. However it's inhumane to ask them to continue working at the same level till they die of exhaustion. We need a system whereby you can work less but still pull some of your pension well into your 70's.      Wasn't the retirement age and reduced working hours brought in to help create jobs? I would hate to still be working when I am 66 and knowing that I am depriving a family of a wage and a better life. This is just a con to allow the government to put off paying a pension, it will soon be anyone under 80 not working is to be looked upon as a scrounger.      If you have an interesting, well paid job where you feel valued and you enjoy your work, the prospect of working on after retirement age might seem attractive. Spare a thought however for those in boring repetitive environments for whom the prospect of retirement is the only bright spot on the horizon - the chance to do something for yourself before old age and decrepitude finally set in. I'm outta here at age 60 to enjoy the rest of my life!      I am most surprised by Mrs Bond's comments. I've no idea which industry she works in, but most industries I've come across seem to like to have a younger workforce where possible. My father just got made redundant at 54, and has had a hell of a time trying to get a new job. Ageism rules in the Thames Valley area, but it shouldn't. If someone wants to work, who are we to stop them. At least it would help to keep pension and health care costs down. I am only 22, and I already expect to work until I'm 70.      Forced retirement is discrimination and as such should have no place in a modern society. I can only speak for myself, but I see no reason why I should retire at an arbitrary age. I'm not convinced by the arguments that there will be fewer opportunities for younger people. There are always new roles being created for which no one has any direct experience. For example, show me a web designer with 10 years experience and I'll show you a liar.      I agree they shouldn't be allowed to kick you out just 'cos you had one birthday too many, but I wouldn't like to be forced into continuing the grind due to financial pressure. There should come a time when it is recognised you've done your bit.      With the state pension getting less and less each year, I would be glad to have the option to continue working. By the time I'm that age I'll probably have to, anyway!      The civilised answer is to let people work as long as they wish to, or to retire in their mid-fifties, if they wish to. Give people the option. Some people are very healthy at 70 and have interesting careers and they do not want to quit work. Others have laboured hard since youth, and have poorer health. They should not be forced to work after reaching the age of 55. As long as the choice is there, let people who are able and wish to work do so regardless of age.      It is all well and good saying about the elderly having key skills and experience, but very little is said and done for the younger generation who are not able to gain any of this experience because employers are only willing to take on experienced labour. How are we supposed to cope with living expenses etc? I am in my early 30's, have no pension, would love to own my own home, would love to have a holiday etc. We need some recognition and assistance, otherwise you will need to be keeping the workforce who are in their 50's or 60's till they die because there will be no one around with any experience or skills to take their places.      We don't seem to know how to hire and fire. So, we resort to a mindless approach: hire the young and fire the old. If we cannot demonstrate an ability of discerning talent, we will find ourselves with a mandated demographic distribution, another mindless approach.      The market will inevitably decide how useful we all are when we're past today's retirement age. Hopefully, the tax and pension laws will be rewritten to deal with the new reality - as the birth rate falls, and the baby boomers live longer, we'll all be working into our 70s. What joy! "
HOC HOC-MM 9.95 " Companies can now patent DNA sequences (obtained from tissue samples) and cures based on them. I would like to know who would get the benefit from such patents. I would suggest a share of the proceeds should go to the NHS and to the patient.      I wonder why the hospital didn't consult the parents, which on the surface of it seems the decent thing to do. Could it be that the hospital didn't think it was doing anything unusual? Maybe the practice of using human tissue in this way is more widespread than we think.      I don't think I would object to tissue like this, that would normally be removed, being used for research but I would object strongly to not being informed. I respect the medical profession but they do not know best in this matter and should at the very least consult the parents.      Everything that doctors and surgeons do, is to help ordinary people like you and me. Keep that in mind when hurling accusations around. If these people wanted to make a few sleazy quid, they would have probably chosen a different profession - politics, perhaps?      The question we need to ask is - at what point do our bodies and those of our children no longer belong to us - but to the NHS? I lost a child 10 years ago and would have been so happy to be able to donate her organs had they been usable due to the illness she had - but questions were asked and honest answers given. If this organ taking is ""no big thing"" then why wasn't anybody told? It seems so underhand because everybody was kept in the dark - yet, had parents been told then there would not have been this problem and confidence in the NHS would not have been shaken. The doctors should try communicating with the patients or parents of patients instead of assuming they have the unquestionable rights.      This country is caught in the grasp of a hangover of ridiculous Christian morals, including the principle of the inviolability of the body. There is of course a good case for having a consent based system, but the debate should not be carried out in the shadow of the outcry it unreasonably causes.      Everything that doctors and surgeons do, is to help ordinary people like you and me. Keep that in mind when hurling accusations around. If these people wanted to make a few sleazy quid, they would have probably chosen a different profession - politics, perhaps?      What people don't know can't hurt them, and in this case it would have been better not to let the truth out. No one was lied to - they were simply not told the full facts, and who can blame staff from keeping such sensitive information secret. The fact is that organs and tissues went to very legitimate research projects, which seems to justify the their use, just as the donation of an organ to a living person. The practice helped to gain some positive benefit out of the tragedy of a child's death, which can only be a good thing.      No matter what organs had been taken ,whether or not they were of any use,parent's consent should always be gained in such matters!      They should ask for consent. I would imagine that it would usually be given if the donation was expained as being for medical research. The problem is that I, and I think others, no longer trust doctor's motives. Could they be selling these organs? Was the removal really necessary? After the mix up with organs from dead babies I think that doctors need to tread carefully.      It doesn't take 5 minutes to read the NHS consent form, believe me, I've read them a few times. They are clear and to the point, in fact they have the a diamond award for good English!      Hype over nothing - the real scandal would be not re-using waste for research. And can the NHS afford for surgeons to spend the time explaining everything in detail?      When our health minister says the Alder Hey report is the most shocking thing he has ever read, and his comments reported on Holocaust Day, i just wonder where the media and government gets its sense of proportion.      I am a doctor and at least 1 morning out of 3, when my radio alarm wakes me up I hear yet another story about how insensitive, uncaring, greedy etc. my profession is. No wonder so many of my colleagues are on antidepressants and/or considering early retirement.      I don't think anyone really has a basis for objection to the practice of using ""spare parts"" for research, but who do the parts belong to. The person, the family, the hospital or the government? If the ""parts"" are to be donated to research then I do feel the person, or the family should at least be consulted if only to give the NHS some credibility which it rather lacks at the moment!      Lets face it, the hospital should have asked for consent to remove the glands or any other part of the patient's body. There is no reason why they haven't done this! That is not an excuse just to say that ""We have used patients organs for donations"", 90% of parents/close relatives do not mind for this to be done, so why not inform them and give them a choice.     The sickest part of all this are the people who will sue for compensation. I bet none of the money sued for will go to help medical research. Money cannot compensate for a dead child any one who pursues this needs to look at their own ethics.      Why is there no statutory right for the patient or patient's representatives to know everything about their treatment? As it is, if you don't ask the right question directly, you won't necessarily get the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Without an obligation to release all relevant information in a set format, doctors will resort to protecting their own backsides in the event of something going wrong, or because they have taken a decision without full consent. In this case, an unwritten hospital and even NHS policy appears to have gone uncommunicated, and probably would have remained so had the previous misdeeds by Alder Hey hospital not been uncovered.      Surgeons should not overlook conflict of laws. One quarter of the world is Muslim and does not permit cremation.      I don't think this is about parents objecting to the donation of their deceased children's organs towards research. I think we are missing the point. As it has already been established, it is of no loss to the deceased child to have the ""gland"" in question removed. On the other hand, it would be of great use to the laboratory that is trying to utilise it for a good cause. I think what this is really about is parents feeling violated that they are not being consulted. These are their children we are talking about. it doesn't matter whether these glands are of use to the deceased children or not and neither is this about the fact that they get $5 for the ""organ"". I think if parents were consulted, they would not object. It is all about the right approach and not getting things done through the back alley.      What does this exercise by the parents actually prove or achieve? These continuing attacks on legitimate research only fill the pockets of cynical lawyers, and damage the ability of researchers to work effectively for all our good. I lost a child from cardiac problems. There was a post-mortem followed by a cremation. I asked no questions, and I was told no lies. If the pathologist used any tissue from my child, then so be it. She did not require it - she was already dead. The parents should be attacking the solicitors, for keeping the pain going.      I carry a donor card and have done since I was of age to do so. I think that after anyone has passed on, if any part of their body could be used to save or enhance the life of another human being, surely that is a great gift and a worthy purpose?      I have every sympathy with the families of children at Alder Hey but I have just heard all doctors described as arrogant and incapable of communicating by an MP on BBC 1 breakfast news discussion. This makes me very angry. My husband, a consultant anaesthetist and director of an Intensive Care unit has dedicated his life to caring for the sick. In reality this has meant my bringing up our children virtually as a one-parent family while he works long hours treating the critically ill. Frequently he comes home late into the evening because he has been spending time with the relatives of his patients helping them to understand what is happening to their loved one. Regularly he is phoned during the night for advice or to find a bed for a new admission. He is not in any way unusual in his commitment.      I totally approve of withdrawing organs. Parents should not be so selfish, don't they realise that research carried out on these organs could save other children's lives? Here in Brazil, you have to state specifically that you are not a potential organ donor otherwise you are automatically consenting to having any organ removed on death, which I think is correct.      It is not right to take a child's organs without the permission of the parent or guardian. It is not right but, I do think that more parents should allow organs to be donated for research or to other needy children.      I fail to see why children are any different to any other human being. Pathologists have been removing organs and tissue and not returning them to the body of the deceased for hundreds of years. If there is an autopsy then shouldn't the organ be returned to the body, whether it is an adult or child, unless the patient or their representative said otherwise.      Parents have a fundamental right to know if anything is done to their Child, regardless of the ""medical Validity"" of what the doctor is doing. Parents are the Guardians of their children and must be kept aware of anything that is done to them. In a day and age where life has had its value reduced almost daily someone has to make a stance for those less able to make decisions for themselves, so leave our children alone and only do that which has been agreed with the parents      I have two sons and both of them have been to hospital. When they were being treated we did not worry so much (although we did worry!) since we had been informed what would be going on, what risks the treatment would have and so on. I don't know how worried we would have been had we not been told anything. We are responsible for our young ones and everyone dealing with our sons should consult us. If teachers (that's what my job is) are asked about their methods and controlled, why should doctors have the right to fail to give information?      If surgeons took the time to explain the procedure in full, and the named nurse, who is supposed to be the patients advocate, asked the questions that parents in distress may not know to ask, then there might not be this problem      I believe the true issue here is that the parents had little or no information on what was going on. I, as a parent would have no objections to such a procedure as long as I had all the facts explained to me.      We humans have some rather odd notions about the sanctity of our bodies, based largely on medieval superstition. Given the chronic shortage of organs for transplants and the need for human tissue to replace animals wherever possible in research, I sometimes think this kind of procedure should be mandatory.      I understand that the hospital received #5 for each of the thymus glands. Given the cost of the surgeon's (and the rest of the theatre staff's) time, it hardly seems to be an organ ""trade"".      Yes times have changed and parents should be consulted. However to demonise the medical profession for what has been accepted practice for many years is wrong. Tonsils, adenoids, appendix have all been removed and I suspect the majority consigned to the incinerator. How much better that use is made of them.      All the doctors I know work tirelessly to cure ills, ease suffering and prolong life. Given the government, media and public willingness to slander, accuse and criticise doctors, I sometimes wonder if they deserve this level of dedication.      This is a completely separate issue to that of keeping dead children's organs. This is a piece of tissue, not an organ - ordinarily it would be burnt, but the hospital have found a way of putting it to good use while receiving a small (but much needed) donation to the cardiac unit. I really don't think that anyone would object to this practise if they were asked but maybe there should be some sort of consent needed.      We seem completely unable to consider the needs of other unfortunate patients who might benefit from (i) an organ donation (ii) later analysis of an organ to aid future research. What a selfish society we do seem to have become.      A dead child is a dead child. They don't become 'more dead' by having no thymus gland (or any other organ). Healthy organs should be removed from dead patients as a matter of course, since they will invariably benefit someone else. Critics should put themselves in the place of patients needing kidneys, eye parts or whatever.      Surely another mountain out of a molehill situation? It is important to have perspective on this issue. Yes, it can be upsetting for parents to learn that a 'part' of their child was given away without consent but we need to be aware that it was surgical waste and not a vital organ. The medical profession deserves some credit in being able to use what was deemed waste into research with the possibility of saving other lives.      While I agree that valuable research can be done using human tissue that is to be discarded, parents' feelings must always be considered when these decisions are taken. It is always tragic when a child is ill or dies and we must never do anything to make such a terrible situation worse.      How small-minded can you get to even think of denying to others the potentially life-saving benefits that can come from this constructive recycling of tissue? I am saddened that people could be so selfish.      I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The tissue would normally have been discarded by the hospital. Why not use it for much-needed research ?      The real issue is one of ownership. Who owns said 'surgical waste'?      The gland is no longer needed by the patient but it can be put to good use by society. This is not a story. Come on... think about it.      Being a child who had a heart operation when they might have taken out the gland, I would be glad if they used it instead of just burning it!      In the case of the dead children's organs being removed without parental consent I completely understand why such a fuss is being made. But in the case of the hospital exchanging a gland which is removed during surgery, and which is therefore no longer of any use to the patient, why should they not exchange it for funds? In the long run they are helping future patients. And in a health service which is stretched for funding and resources what is the problem? Maybe these things should be put in perspective, rather than being used in a witch hunt.      I believe that as long as the hospital is ethical and does everything above board, I don't see why this is an issue. However, having said that, can we trust the hospital to be such?      I was scandalised to hear the news of organ trading! This is my understanding of what I have heard. Doctors trying to help sick babies removed an apparently useless gland in order to operate more effectively. Rather than throw the tissues away, they passed them to a research company which could use the tissues in their search for ways of helping people suffering from cancer. The research company gave a donation to the hospital to cover expenses. What wicked people! To top it all, when faced with parents concerned about their real, loved, sick babies, they did not spend the time insensitively discussing every technical detail. How can we ever trust doctors again?      Doctors need to do a better job of telling the parents of patients exactly what is going on. In a time of crisis, most parents don't get the chance to read a consent form in detail, and so may have no idea that a body part would be used for research. I bet that most wouldn't object to this practice as long as they were properly informed that it would occur. However, they deserve right to be asked.      It might be worthwhile to point out with the recent hysteria and terrorism of a few deluded individuals, where are future scientific and health developments going to come from if we shouldn't use animals or discarded human tissue? What are the much-vaunted alternatives? The public want and should get more information about these issues. As the health service is so stretched that most doctors don't have time to discuss the medical issues with the patient, I don't think we can expect them to have time to discuss the details of possible uses for discarded human tissues. This is a public service our Government should provide.      How come the Minister responsible is blaming others when he is in charge?      The parents should ALWAYS be kept informed about such issues. The fact that these tissues are routinely discarded is immaterial - medical staff should seek parents' or guardians' consent when removing any organ.      Let's not forget that on the consent form it does state that tissue removed may be used for research. The parents did consent even if they didn't read the small print. As for selling it, the NHS needs money and if they can raise it from pharmaceutical companies who are willing to pay for what is technically waste - go for it!      Never mind whether it should have asked for their consent, why did it NOT ask for their consent? It should have done this purely out of courtesy even if there are no medical or ethical guidelines to enforce such a procedure.     Why should anyone object to a hospital in the poor cash-starved NHS making some much-needed funds by selling something which would have otherwise been incinerated? I really don't see what the fuss is about. Some emotionally vulnerable and ill-informed people seem to have been whipped up to a storm of fury by the media looking for yet another anti-NHS story.      Let's hope they don't start removing perfectly healthy organs unnecessarily, just so they can sell them...      Do we really want to know everything that might happen to a dead body? For example, the procedures used in post mortems and funeral parlours? Do we really want to prevent the experts from examining body tissue to discover why our loved ones were ill or died, and then using that information to prevent it happening again. And do we really want to impede medical research done on body parts of no use or value? I think the key thing here is whether the doctors treat both living and dead people with respect. It is possible to do that and study body parts for medical advances. We should stop making life any harder for these professionals      This is simply ludicrous. The tissue was waste tissue. It was being removed anyway. No one profited. And hey, some good use came of it in terms of future treatment for others. I think we should congratulate Alder Hey on their efforts and ingenuity. Alan Milburn should take a few deep breathes and calm down as there is simply no point in stoking up an outrage over this.      Is the argument regarding the use of the tissue or the fact that the hospital received donations? As the tissue was normally discarded, at a cost to the hospital, I can see no problem with using it for research.      Whatever can be done to help others should be done wherever possible. Some parents are unable to accept that their child is unable to be saved. They should be thankful for the medical staff for, at least, trying to prevent their death and doing so in the most humane way. To then attack them for using otherwise useless organs shows where their real considerations lie.      When a close relative of mine died I was only too glad to have his body used for research (i.e an autopsy was carried out). Whether this was done with my consent or not, as long as he was dead, how can any sane person object? Hospital staff are working under an increasingly intolerable burden, not only of work load but of inadequate funding and a hostile public who demand cures for everything as their right. Without them we'd all suffer. With them, we all can benefit. And yes, mistakes are occasionally made and bad decisions will be taken. Who can claim not to?      As with before taking anything it is always polite to ask first. With remains or minors the parents or guardians should be asked first. "
JOC JOC-12A-02N 8.46 "I can't understand how the people want to do cosmetic procedure feel. I shudder at the mere mention of it. Bury the implant in own face? Its so horrible! I don't understand the necessity of changing one's face through cosmetic-surgery. Patients have to run a risk as well as pay much money. If they want to restore their youthful look, they can have massages instead of cosmetic surgeries. They must be safer though it costs money and time.  I don't know whether cosmetic-surgery is right action or not. But I believe that it has a big risk to hurt our body. I want to change my body but I will not to change it because it is too dangerous.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think it's natural for people to want to get beauty and being confident in own looks is very important. Actually, people appearing on TV program featuring plastic surgery often look lively and nice after the operation. So I also think cosmetic procedure including ""chin jobs"" is one of ways to live happily for us and no one can criticize for that action.  i think it is really hard say whether cosmetic surgery is right or wrong. because as ID12028 say, it is natural that people wants to be beautiful and also other people say surgery involves high risk. but i believe if person wants to be beautiful he/she should do surgery because advance in medical technology can get rid of person's unconfident looks and make person's life happier. . . . . . maybe. . . .  I didn't agree with the cosmetic-surgery at first because it cost a lot like 1 million yen for just one, small operation. I thought it's waste of money and we should use the money for something else. But as ID12028 said, it's natural for people to want to get beauty. Some are not satisfied with their looking and envy their nice-looking friends. And in some cases, so-called ugly students become the target of bullying. So I understand their feeling. But I still cannot agree with the liposuction because it's just the result of lack of effort. If people want to get thin, they should reconsider their dietary habit and start exercising not just depending on surgery. I know some people cannot lose their weight because of some kind of diseases but in most of the cases, I guess such people are overeating. Anyway, I can agree with cosmetic-surgery except for liposuction.   sorry, ""1 million yen"" is correct To tell the truth, I don't really care whether they do cosmetic surgery or not. We humans have the right to chose whatever we wanted to do, so it's up to the individual choice. But if I were asked to do cosmetic surgery, I definitely won't do that. It seems very painful to me and, moreover, I feel sorry for my parents by hurting the body they gave me. But if an individual can augment happiness of his/her life by doing cosmetic surgery, I can't stop them. You only live once. Just try what you think is the best !! I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past.  I agree with ID12029 and ID12049's idea. Whether you have plastic surgery or not depends on individual liberty. If you want to become beautiful, you might have plastic surgery after deeply thinking risk of it failing. What is more important than this, you should not have prejudices against the people who have plastic surgery. Especially in Japan there is the number of the people who have biased view against plastic surgery. Incidentally I don't want to have plastic surgery because I am very afraid of being operated.  I think it dependent on the person whether cosmetic-surgery is carried out. In Japan, many people want to change their bodies. It is natural to want to become more beautiful. But I don't think so. This is because I want to take good care of myself.  I am sure there are a great number of people who wish to be more beautiful and imagine the result of cosmetic surgery. It is natural that living people seek the beauty. But I hear that it is too expensive and so risky that they tend to hesitate to have surgery. And, as ID12055's opinion, Generally Japanese tend to scorn people who underwent surgery. For example, some actresses whose figures have changed obviously are criticized on the Internet. I think this is the biggest issue about cosmetic surgery. We should be more tolerant to this matter. Whoever hopes and afford to have surgery ought to carry out without any hesitation. By the way, if I get rich in the future, I may hope surgery.  I heard that straightening our teeth helped us build up our health. I don't think too much cosmetic surgery is good, but I don't clearly say that cosmetic surgery should not done. Having cosmetic surgery makes people feel confident and happy.  I don't think I want to do cosmetic procedure because it costs a lot, and it's dangerous. But I can understand why many people want to do it. Of course, I admire the person who is a handsome. In the end, I think it's free to do cosmetic surgery or not.  I think cosmetic surgery is a way to lead a better life. If you do cosmetic surgery and can make your life better, it will be meaningful deed. However, even though you change your face, you can't your life unless you change yourself. And it costs a lot and may be dangerous. So you should drop into deep thought before you do cosmetic surgery.  Cosmetic surgery occasionally fails. So, this procedure has risks. But, I have no reason to disagree with cosmetic surgery. There are a lot of people who worry about their own looks. For some people, this problem influences their lives and works. So, I think it is inexpensive to dissolve these problem to spend money. Anyway, cosmetic surgery is a personal matter. Other people shouldn't interfere. If we undergo cosmetic surgery, we should do our responsibility and judgment.  I don't think people should not have cosmetic surgeries. Whatever we say, we are likely to judge others from their appearances. Therefore some people have senses of inferiority as they don't want to live any more. If they thought that they couldn't live without having cosmetic surgery, I think that will be OK. So I generally agree with cosmetic surgeries. But some people depend on cosmetic surgeries, run through their entire money, fail surgeries, repeat it endlessly, and fall into what we call 'cosmetic surgery hell'. Although I don't deny cosmetic surgeries, in order not to be in such traps, people should consider it again and again before having cosmetic surgeries.  I think cosmetic surgery is very important to some person. Because it becomes a tool in order to lead a good life. When I dislike my face, it may be able to lead the life it is better to cosmetic surgery. So I think cosmetic surgery is not but.  To be sure cosmetic surgery may be important to some people. I can understand their thought. But I can't think cosmetic surgery is good. At least I have not thought I want to do that. As many people said, cosmetic surgery cost a lot and is very dangerous. Doing something to body is very awful for me, even that is normal surgery.  I don't think plastic surgery is bad. I'm not woman, but I can understand of hoping to be beautiful. One of my eyelids is with no fold, and other is double-fold. I really dislike them! Men feel beautiful to the symmetry things. So my face is not beautiful I think. I think if their problems can be solved by money, it's so good. It's the best way, no one feel sad, everyone feels happy, if you understand operations' danger.  I think it's unnecessary to change each face. I have never thought that I'm handsome, and It's the natural that everyone wants to be handsome, pretty, beautiful, or nice face, however we should accept each inborn face. However ugly your face is, someone loves you!! In addition cosmetic surgery cost a lot and it's unsafe. In short I think it's needless I can understand feeling of people who want cosmetic surgery, but I don't want to do cosmetic procedure. Because it take a lot of money and it's very dangerous. I think everyone should have confidence to face more. I looked at the picture of Bruce Forsyth, I was surprised at the size of his chin.  Thinking to want to restore our youthful look is good . So I think cosmetic surgery is not bad. However cosmetic surgery hurts our bodies and it's very dangerous. Under certain circumstances we died from cosmetic procedure. So I think cosmetic surgery is not worth taking risks.  Cosmetic surgery has been popular recently in the world. I think it should be important if surgery is not endowed from the parent face. I want my children to cosmetic surgery is not absolute.  I suppose that these kinds of cosmetic surgery will be more popular in several years , and that not only in the US but in Asian countries such as China, South Korea etc, the demands for them will be rapidly increasing year after year. Today, these operations still cost too much, but as the technology is improving, these cost will lessen and many more people will undergo them without thinking seriously.  I think that we have freedom of choice. But it costs patients a lot of money to be operated on for cosmetic surgery and maintain their bodies or face. Furthermore, as the article, if people are operated, most of them come to want to be modify other parts. In the end, their bodies or face will lose their shapes. It is true that if you are operated, you may be beautiful and gain confidence. However, it is the only short term. So I strongly believe that it is better that you aren't operated.  A chin is charge of various functions such as mastication. Thus if we have cosmetic surgery on our chin, we may look nice, but the original functions may decline at the same time. I think we shouldn't have cosmetic surgery which exposes us to health hazards.  In Japan, implants are unusual surgery. The patients try to hide that they did cosmetic surgery. This is because Japanese environment can't accept cosmetic surgery as a usual thing. On the other hand, in America or Korea, many people do cosmetic surgery in order to become younger. It shows that America has many kinds of people in country, so that they are used to accept different points of each other. This is one of the good points of American culture. At this point, I think Japan should learn this culture.  I think it is okay to do cosmetic surgery if the person wants to do and need it. It is expensive and dangerous so I would not recommend the person to do so unless if the person really needs to.  I myself don't want to do cosmetic surgery. I think what the person is like is far more important than how he/she looks. On the other hand , I admit that there is a opinion such that ones first impression is quite important and it's greatly depend on ones features. So, I don't care other people do cosmetic surgery.  I think that the cosmetic surgery will damage your body or heart sometimes. The result after taking the surgery might be different from your ideal. I recommend that the person who wants to have cosmetic surgery need to think about that danger. I do not want to have the surgery because I feel so dangerous to have the surgery.  I think that it is individual freedom. Desire to become beautiful is a natural thing. Even if it is able to sympathize, I don't want to have plastic surgery. Plastic surgery is different from makeup or diet, I feel like it is denying oneself. Moreover life does not necessarily become bright just because you have plastic surgery. Not only appearance but an inside is important. Things will turn out fine if you have enough determination.  I think people who have plastic surgery abandon themselves. If you want to look better, you need to make extra special efforts. I never thought of having plastic surgery, but I have been trying various things to look better such as doing some running and restricting the amount of food for reducing fat. People should confront themselves and do their best to get better look.  When I read this article, I think this news shows how Japanese and people around world feels about plastic surgery. I had read the article that 80% of Korean have plastic surgery (Not sure all Korean or only women). Also, many of them publicize that they had plastic surgery. On the other hand, Japanese want to hide whether they had plastic surgery. I think this is one of examples that show Japanese ""shame"" culture.  I think that plastic surgery is no good. Faces are one of most characteristic parts of people. To process them would confuse their relationships, have a bad influence. When you want to change yourself, you should improve your inside.  I can understand why there are people who would like to change their body or face by plastic surgery. They believe that if they get their ideal bodies and faces, they could get their ideal lives. But, I think that plastic surgery is not good. Our bodies and faces are given by our parents. If we change our bodies and faces by performing operations on those, they must unpleasant. So, I don't think I would like to have any plastic surgeries.  I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence.  I have some complex with my face. But I haven't want to have plastic surgery. Because my face is important identity of myself. If you change your face and body by plastic surgery, it means that you lose your identity. If you change your face, you lost reliance and have more complexes about your looks. So I think that plastic surgery should not be done in any account.  I think whether people decide to change their faces or other parts should be depended on their own mind. For some people who think their looking is not good, it may be wonderful that they can modify their bodies with new technology. But I am concerned about something. Do surgeons give customers enough information about their operations?There must be some risks with the procedure. The customers should know about them. The doctors should explain the details of the operations to their customers and the customers should think with that explanation.  I am opposed to cosmetic surgery. This is because it may lead people who get the operation to being frustration. For example, Michael Joseph Jackson had had an operation in succession because of his wish that he wanted to be more beautiful.  I don't understand why people want to change their own face. Their face came from parents therefore it might make parents feel bad.  I firmly think committing a cosmetic surgery is not good. I always emphasis that naturality is the best. Naturality helps people to maintain own existence. Furthermore, it makes more variety world, and society. I think having a cosmetic surgery means concealing own existence. Besides, however medical treatment has improved, actually there are tremendous risk when doing cosmetic surgery. Sometimes cosmetic surgery brings terrible side effect. Therefore, I think doing cosmetic surgery is no proper.  It is good for us to mind ourselves and make ourselves better on outlook. But i don't think cosmetic surgeon is good for anyone because we are the children of God. We are given our own body and it's natural for us to differ from each other. So we should be proud ourselves and enjoy crude ourselves.  Personally , I can't accept the cosmetic surgery because there is a high possibility of failure. If operation fails, patients will perhaps suffer more than ever before. But cosmetic surgical procedure may give some people hope. So I think no one can criticize such operations.  I'm really sorry to be late for posting my comment. I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.  I don't think that cosmetic-surgery is good. Because doing it costs much money and one mistake can cost a person his life. I don't agree that South Korean people operate with ease. I think that the face is personal, so cosmetic-surgery shouldn't do easily without considering well.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery as I understand that everyone would prefer looking better. I would not hate myself not just because my looking is not perfect, but I would be more satisfied with my appearance if my eyes were bigger, face was smaller, and etc. Since the technology and techniques we have today have extremely improved in the last few years, it should not be criticized as much for the people to have cosmetic surgery. Like ID12003 said in his comment, cosmetic surgery may give some people 'hope', which can be explained as hope to live, smile, and love themselves.  Technology and techniques* I disagree with plastic surgery in two ways. Firstly, plastic surgery can industrialize the medical system. As our society is appearance-oriented, plastic surgery is in high demand. Plastic surgeons can make a lot of money these days as well. Thus, many medical students apply to specialize in plastic surgery. On the other hand, specializations important for public health, like internal medicine and general surgery are waning due to the lack of talent, as these departments promises significantly lower pay as compared to being a plastic surgeon. This tendency polarizes the medical system and threatens public health. Secondly, plastic surgery can undermine individuality. With the plastic surgery, people can transform their appearance to whatever they want. Because media broadcasts a unified look, people admire that particular appearance, and seek to achieve that through plastic surgery. Thus it can be said that plastic surgery and the media makes people lose their individuality. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with plastic surgery.  I agree with cosmetic surgery because all the people have a complex. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good. There is prejudice for cosmetic surgery still more in Japan and will take time so that cosmetic surgery becomes common Because doing cosmetic surgery is not only making people beautiful, also fixing the part of his/her wrong body part. When i was in Canada, my friend got hit by a baseball and broke his nose, and when he came back from hospital his face looks weird. so he did cosmetic surgery and fix his nose. so i strongly disagree with just saying cosmetic surgery is bad.  I agree because she out the problem I also considered. we think that the prejudice for surgery is one of the biggest issues.  I agree with cosmetic surgery. It is common around the world except Japan. I think it depends on private liberty. Even though there is still a prejudice about plastic surgery in Japan, the time will come when it is in general use.  I think it is free for individuals to reform their face. Butt I don't agree to cosmetic surgery, because I don't want to reform myself. I want you to think well cosmetic surgery like this news.  Human's pursuits of beauty know no bounds. If the patient feels satisfied, that's OK, I think, but personally I don't want to be operated any plastic surgeries because there is a big risk of malpractice.  I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. It's true that most of us have a hope to change our face. I think my face is our parents' present, so however ugly it looks, it shouldn't be changed. Moreover, changing the face so much is bad for crime prevention too.  I am for the cosmetic surgery. It won't be a big deal to others, also, it would be the chance to make them feel confident. I suppose people who want to do it have difficulty feeling themselves confident. Cosmetic surgery surely help them deal such problems.  I think everybody can do the cosmetic surgery if they want to . no one has the right to stop them and also, people have the right to do what they want to. I know that all the girls want to look nice and pretty, and I think there are no problem about what they think. Some people say that ""your face is given from your parents so don't change it"" but I don't think so . Children can't choose their own face when they are born. If people can't be positive or happy because they think they look ugly, I think they should do the cosmetic surgery.  I do not entirely agree with cosmetic surgery, but if some think cosmetic surgery make themselves confident and positive, I think it's good. Recently, a more casual type of cosmetic surgery called ""Puchi-seikei"" have become famous. Yet, there are some cases of failure in surgery operated by uncertified doctor, so people should be careful.  I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.  It's because I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. Your body was inherited, in other words, given by your parents. The right to change your body is not only yours, so I disagree with it.  I think un orthopedist should be permit.  I have same opinion about cosmetic surgery, too. I want to straighten my teeth because I want to grin with confident, not smile. If I have straightened my teeth, I will have confident to laugh. I think it is natural for people to want their look nice.  I see that it is horrible to bury the implant in own face, but I don't agree with this opinion. I guess someone who wants to make them beautiful has very strong mind. They want to change their face from the bottom of their heart. They don't think it is horrible to bury the implant in order to make them beautiful. That is why I disagree with that opinion.  I think doing cosmetic surgery is personality problems and it's natural to want to be more beautiful especially for women, so I think it's permitted for anyone. People selecting cosmetic operation have the rights to live freely. In fact, people became good-looking must have confidence in them and also become happy. It's the most essential thing in nice life.  I've commented almost the same thing. There is no reason to deny the plastic surgery since it does not harm anyone as long as the surgeon makes mistake. It would make the patients feel confident and also make them look nice. What's the problem? I think shaping is scary. That is damage to the body.  I totally disagree with this comment. I know that our face is given from parents. . . but so what? Children can't choose their face. If they look ugly, and feel bad about it, they can't live happily. All the people have a right to live happily. It is written in our national constitution. Satisfaction with face will make people positive. Being positive, you can make more friends. It's not always like this, but I just wanted to say that this happiness chain is likely to happen. About crime prevention, I don't understand what he means at all. It's no matter who change the face and although if cosmetic surgery is considered as illegal, the victims change their face if they need to. Law can't stop victims doing cosmetic surgery.  I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one. Then you can get your confidence. Machi Hattori I agree this comment. Face is fact of identity for a people, and it is important for them.  It is true that the concept of handsome will vary according to the country the person belongs, but whether to change his/her face is entrusted to oneself so I believe we can just leave them to make their won choice by themselves.  I think it is freedom to do cosmetic-surgery or not. If you want to be more beautiful, it is the one way to realize it. I think there is no problem you will be more positive and enjoy your life by doing cosmetic-surgery. But it is necessary to consider about costs, danger and so on.  I agree with ID12028. That's why all the people have a complex. plastic surgery involves danger. If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good.  I agree with this opinion because I have same idea as him. In modern society, decision about oneself is freedom. Because of this, no one can interference with personal decision. This comment reflect this kind of spirit very well. If I have to choose agree or not, I disagree with plastic surgery. But I think let plastic surgery as personal liberty is democratic thing.  I disagree to having plastic surgery. It is because there are no bounds to improve the section that we don't like in our face. So, it is wasteful to invest money in the plastic surgery.  I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think appearance is the most important of first impression. Also, when I choose my girl friend, appearance is the most important factor.  I found it surprising that people are age want to have a plastic surgery. It will obviously make your appearance good now but I do not think it will stay forever. Appearance will be consumed by time anyway but loosing your appearance without it being consumed, I think it's kind of pathetic.  I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID12029 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. ID12015 said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past. I do not agree to this as I do not like the fact that people want to change their faces. Even though it is a minor change, your body was born from mother who suffered pain to give birth to you so I think you should take care of your body.  I strongly disagree with the person who wrote this comment. He should not have written such a thing as it might hurt those people who wish for cosmetic surgery. I do not think he will ever understand other people's feelings.  I thought this comment makes a good point. I think that it is definitely natural for people to get beauty and confidence in own looks. I also agree with the idea that no one should criticize the people who wish to have that 'natural thing' for them to live the only one life they have.  I am not against people having plastic surgery strongly because sometimes, getting a good looks would change one's life in a better way. But I still can't have a good understanding for it. Having a plastic surgery means that they will not be able to see their real faces or body again. Especially for face, it could also mean that their baby wont have the same look as their parent forever. And for their parents, they wont be able to see the face of their child that reminds of their wife or husband anymore. I think this is really sad thing. Now a days plastic surgery is getting easier to have and in some country it is thought as something normal to do. But I think people should think a lot before having it especially if they were young.

JOC JOC-12A-05N 9.16 "I guess the number of gay people in Japan is much smaller than in America, so the gay marriage issue may not be so familiar to Japanese. However this might be one of the most biggest issue for people all over the world because this is related to the human rights. I believe it's freedom for all people to love somebody, but in reality most of the countries ban gay marriage. And I wonder why such many people in America are against the gay marriage. In my opinion, their rights should be defended.  I think that I agree with legalizing gay marriage. This is because there is individual freedom. Moreover, it is said that many gays have a lot of stress in their mind because they aren't accepted. So government should legalize gay marriage to relief their stress. If government legalize it, government should permit them to get tax benefits and adopt children. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, when they get a job, if they tell companies that they are gays themselves, some of companies may not employ them. Secondly, they need to get mental treatment. Furthermore, they cannot give birth to a baby so government has to consider adopting children. But, in view of politics, I think that Obama made a big decision. This is because Christianity ban gay marriage. Especially Catholic stick closely to Catholicism. In other words, Obama's remark is the same thing as throw away vote of Catholic. These days, there is the trend of accepting gay marriage. But I'm curious to see how it will turn out.  This is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. In Japan, it's the unrealistic problem yet. I suppose that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc.  By the way, media says Mr. Obama's approval of such marriage is one of election campaigns. I'm interested in eligible voters' movement especially young people.  I think that gay marriage is individual free. There is no reason for opposing, if they are fortunate. Why is it prohibition in the United States? I think that the reason is that children decrease in number. The gay couple should not have a child. Because a child needs a mother absolutely. And the child who grew up at the special home has a high possibility of running to wrongdoing. So I think the conclusion of this problem is very difficult.  For my part, at present, I can't agree to the same-sex marriage. It is said some people are afraid of being loved by gay people, and also said the birthrate in the country may decline. Both of them I 'm afraid too. On the contrary, however, these view may have some misconceptions. And history tells us that there were many gay people in ancient Greece and the Warring States period of Japan, which indicates the gay rights is not necessarily the problem specific to today. Moreover, the Japanese TV programs show that there are many gay people who is proud of themselves. The more Japanese people know them, the more they may be tolerate to the gay. In conclusion, now i'm against gay marriage, but in the future, I'll change my thoughts if I have more information about gay people.  I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. Gay people loves partners of the same sex as heterosexual people love opposite sex, so no one or no law cannot prohibit these emotions. Is the birth rate of higher priority than human rights? I don't think so. In addition to institutional manage, government should enhance the understanding of gay people to solve problems springing from prejudice against gay people such as difficulty in adopting children.  I experienced empathy with Obama's opinion. As there are so many people in the world, there are various ways of expressing love. So I think it is important to understand diverse love, and not to have a prejudice against gay couples.  When I live in Japan , I think that ""same-sex  marriage"" don't become the talk. In America, Mr Obama regards getting many votes for same-sex  couples as the way to win in a sense. Meanwhile Mr Romney is against gay marriage. It is true that increasing rights for gay citizens is very important but I think that in the USA the religion has something to do with all things as such life. So we will have to see how things develop.  This problem was hard to believe for me. In Japan, the number of same-sex  couples is extremely small and the problem is not a big problem compared with foreign countries, Perhaps because religion is involved, such as. I agree that same-sex  couples should be able to marry. If people fell in love a same-sex  by chance, I think it can not be helped, and I think it is good if they get along in life. The number of same-sex  couples in Japan is increasing recent years. I think the problem should be more considered by society as a whole in Japan I think it is individual freedom. Although I'm against to this. I expect that permitting same-sex marriage will cause a lot of social problems.  I think that same-sex couples are able to marry because they love with each other. We can not say anything for that. If they can not marry even they love with each other, I think that it is not fair. There is no rule, like males have to like females or females have to like males.  I think same sex marriage should be legal. Same sex couple just love each other so I don't want them to give up to get marry because of the gender. But I think same sex couple should not have the right to adopt children unless the children understand about it.  As most people here say, I agree with legalizing gay marriage. Whether you love same-sex or opposite sex depends on you. It is wrong that nation prohibits guy marriage. However as ID12053 points out , whether same-sex couple should be allowed to adopt children or not is big and complicated question. Same-sex couple should be allowed right same as opposite-sex couple but considering children, children should be brought up by mother and father.  As most of my classmates say, I agree with I think that gay marriage should be acceptable legally and socially. Humans have the right to love person without regard to sex. None of my friends have confessed that he/she is gay. But if I get friends who are gay, I will be ready to accept them. And gay couple should be given the rights that general couples ordinarily possess. I disagree with ID12055's opinion a little. As they say, I consider that deliberating children's future and feelings is very important and necessary. We must not shun these. However, if some of children show their own opinion obviously, we can consider that gay couples adopt him/her. We should not respect only our guesses too much.  I'm agree to gay marriage like others do. I do think it's their freedom to have marriage with same-sex  and have a family. However, at the same time, I'm disagree with the idea of same-sex  couple to adopt children. I don't think it's something wrong to fall in love with same gender, but to child, it could be differ. Also, when children got old without knowing father/mother figure, they tend to abuse their children. So, I think it's not suitable to let same-sex  couple to adopt children.  I believe that same-sex couple should be equal with others. As ID12044 say, I think the religious is the matter for them. Christian don't allow the same-sex marriage, and that is why same-sex couples are difficult to marriage. I know the religious is important for them, however, it is strange that human don't have same equal right. We are all equal before the low. I strongly support same-sex couple.  When I read this news I was surprised. Although many gay people all over the world, I think that it has been certified in the United States and it have an appreciable effect. There are many gay people in Japan. I think that they will want to certified.  The same sex couple should have some rights such as living together, getting married, and etc. But there is one thing should not be accepted, it is adopting children. Because, I think it is harsh for the children to know and accept the relationship of their parents.  I think the marriage of gay couples should be legal as others said. They have their rights to live happily with person who they love. Well, but I don't think it will be. Especially in Japan, there are many people who have stereotypes to gay couples and this will not vanish in a short period of time. Although there are ones who think like I think, I suppose it's impossible to make allowance for gay couples to marry because it will be possible that those who married with same-sex partners will be persecuted by others.  I think same-sex  couples should be able to marry. If they love each other, why not marry? Everyone will have your love. Then, of course you'll want to marry your partner. Why must not same-sex  couples marry? Though only they cannot have a child, it's important to marry. If they want a child, they can adopt. A lot of social problems are occurred if same-sex  couples can marry. However more people will be happy.  In Japan, there are not many people who are gay. So I have never thought about gay marriage carefully. But after reading this article, I think priority should be given to the both two people's feelings. Therefore, I agree with gay marriage. However, after marriage, they may be seen strange by other people. A lot remains to be done for gays to live under normal conditions.  I agree with Obama's suggestion. This is because it is freedom of choice, which we all enjoy. We must respect the will of individual. I strongly believe we should treat same-sex couples as ordinary different-sex couples. In Japan gay people are not as familiar as in the US So I suppose lots of Japanese, including me, are surprised at this news article.  I think we should not have a prejudice against same-sex couples. Because every people have the right to pursue their happiness. It has nothing to do with which sex they love. So I agree with Obama. I hope that more people become to think any people, even he is different from us, are equal and have the rights .  Gay marriage should be recognized in Japan. There is no problem about it, but a constitution must be revised. The government should discuss immediately. I want all people to do a better life.  I guess this problem will come to Japan someday. Then, I think gay marriage should not be legal. There has been some gays in Japan. And, they play in television. But, there are people who criticize gays, too. If gay marriage is admitted in legal, the government has to discuss and amend the law. And, it takes much time to do this. But, I think the government has many problems to solve immediately. So, I think people should not discuss this now in Japan.  This had been the big problem in America from many years ago. I have many friends in NY, and also there are many gay friends. Compared to Japanese, my gay friends don't try to hide their special characteristics. I think this is the good points in American culture. America is composed by many immigrations. Everyone accepted this situation and many kinds of people lived together. This is why gay friends can live without some feelings of shame rather than Japanese. I agree with President Obama about gay marriage. Thanks to this rule, many gay people can love each other like us and this help them except other gay people in all over the world.  In my opinion, same-sex  couples should be able to get married. Of course, I know there are various religions in the United States and some people think it is a bad thing. I think it is difficult that ALL citizens agree with guy marriage. There are lots of opinions in the country. But I think ""the government"" should not ban the marriage. If it ban the marriage because they are same-sex , does the government disturb the citizen's freedom of the marriage?If they love with each other and want to wed, the government can't ban the marriage.  I think it should be followed to get married for same-sex couple. The first reason, I believe that there is really big love between them. So, I can understand their thought and want them to be happy. The second reason, orphans will get less because the same-sex couples can't make child by themselves. Of course, there are many things not to be followed traditionally, but to make everyone happy, we should change the rules or customs.  I agree with Obama. Surely, same sex couples are rare. However, they are not definitely wrong. It is freedom whom they love. Guy marriage isn't different from ordinary marriage. Also it is important for us to admit various sense of value. So I think guy marriage should be legal.  I certainly agree with what Obama has proclaimed. We humans have a right to love who we want to love and no one has the right to violate that kind of right. But Obama should also think about current situation of America. In America, still many people have the prejudice against same-sex   love because of their religion or morality or any other reasons. So what I wanted to say is that we have to take into consideration of such kinds of ideas that people have in order to protect same-sex   couples. What is best is that maybe gradually modify the thoughts of people who have a bias against same-sex   marriage, not just ignoring the ideas of people who have bias against same-sex   couples, and finally create a situation that same-sex   marriage is a normal thing in the society.  I'm in favor of gay marriage. The most important thing in democracy is to respect personal thoughts. Besides marriage is one of the most important event in our life. Therefore, gay marriage should be admitted.  Though I know little about tax system, I agree with same sex marriage. Because they can't give up loving the same sex person. That isn't changeable. But I disagree with them to adopt children. For one thing, as they are both men the children won't be treated healthfully. Second, children can't choose whether they should be adopted them or not.  When I read this article, I was very surprised, and thought this is very good news. In many countries and areas, same sex couple are not recognized by the public. Obama did so courageous decision. I wish this Obama's new method succeed. And, I think that Japan also have to recognized gay's marriage right.  I think gay marriage should be admitted. Because they love each other as usual couple. If this thinking of love was not admitted, it would be violation of human right. But, It is difficult to admit gay couple.  I argue that the institution of marriage has traditionally been defined as between a man and a women. If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. The gay community has created its own vibrant culture. By reducing the gap of opportunities and experiences between gay and heterosexual people, the unique culture may crease to exist.  Barack Obama said that same-sex  couples should be able to get married. But still it is a very difficult problem. In my opinion, same-sex  couples should not be able to married. Many people have a bias against gay couples and cannot accept their idea now. I don't agree with gay marriage as yet.  As Barack Obama said, I think same-sex couple marriage should be allowed in other countries too. It is something to do with the human rights and everyone should be free. There is no way that they can stop them getting together.  As to gay marriage, I agree to it. It's because people should have the right to choose partner who would make ones life more precious, I think. But, I can only feel that the president, announcing like this, thinks too much about gaining supports from those back gay marriage for following election. As a result, it's not clear to me if he really has strong creed to pay attention to same sex couples. Of course, I admit that by showing his favor to the couples, more or less, people has something positive to them, so it couldn't necessarily be said too much selfish.  As many people said, i think this is individual problem. and what President Obama said is very courageous. I think same-sex marriage should be allow. Because i think marriage only relates to two people who wants to marry, and if it doesn't bring trouble to anyone i think this wedding should be allow. but if same-sex marriage cause any problem, we should ban as soon as possible.  I think same-sex  couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex  couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex  couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex  couples should have the right to get married.  I think same-sex  couples' marriages should be admitted. It is natural that you hope to stay with someone who you love. But, today, same-sex  marriages are not common, it is difficult way for same-sex  couples. I think Barack Obama's statement is very important one. I want other countries follow his examples and take actions for same-sex  couples.  I agree with homosexual marriages. I think prohibiting gay marriages runs counter to human rights. We investigate gay people's human rights with respect to marriage. In my opinion, happiness possessing rights, equality rights and privacy rights are violated in this scenario. The entitlement of happiness possessing rights is already guaranteed by first amendment in Virginia Bill of Rights. It is stipulated in 13rd amendment of constitution of Japan too. Freedoms without distinction of any kind of status are guaranteed by Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutions of most countries guarantee this right too. And in 2003, Texas Supreme Court judged that the prohibition of homosexual activity is against the right of privacy. Actually, many countries like Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, Canada, Argentina permit same sex couple marriage. In fact the Netherlands have law of anti-discrimination. According to this law, gays have the same rights as heterosexual couples. These are reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage This is reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage I agree with Obama's opinion. The right to marry must be given to every people equally, and it enables us to live with someone. If someone loves others of the same sex, no one can criticize them and keep them from being happy. It is free to love whoever.  I think that no one bother the right to say persons they love, "" I love you. "" This is a human right, of course, whether male or female. Nothing is crueler than that this right is denied. It is natural that they would like to marry and live with their lovers. So, I support Obama's opinion at this point. Why are there a right to forbid their love? I disagree with Obama's opinion. Gay must be prohibited strictly. There is only one reason to think so. Gay is not correct in ethics. A living thing in the earth have to leave offspring.  I agree with Obama's opinion. I argue that everyone is given some liberties, a thought, a property, and even marriage. There is a person who argues that if gay marriage is accepted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. But there are many orphans in the world. So, I think they are able to be adopted by same-sex couples.  It would have been quite difficult for gay and lesbian couples in the current society as many people do not even try to understand the ways they choose their partners for life. In my opinion, however, same-sex  marriage should be allowed because I think that no one has a right to force someone to love or marry only opposite-sex person. I guess that same-sex  marriage is criticized especially by Christians who regard it as it is against God, but other than that, it does not cause any problems.  As she said, it is important to understand other people's love so we could not judge whether homosexual is right or wrong.  I agree with this. I think same sex marriage should be admitted but they should not have rights to have adopting children.  I don't think same sex marriage will cause many social problem.  I strongly agree with her opinion because I also believe everyone must be has the same right either men or women. It would be discrimination if people distinguish between male and female. I convince that there is no matter to marry when they love each other. I have the acquaintance who is gay, however, it is nothing different from us. I think people should be more open for same-sex marriage.  I agree with this idea. I think that Gay marriage should be permitted. But if this marriage are permitted, various problem will be caused.  I think that gay and lesbian couples have rights to marry. To marry is existing for lovers. There is no fatal gap between usual couple and gay couple. I hate people who discriminate gays and lesbians. There are a lot of people. So I think that each persons have their own right to be happy. Obama did great job.  I disagree with this comment. First, it's not concerned whether anti-gay people exist or not. There is no bad effect on such people. It may be difficult for them to immediately accept gay people, but it's more difficult for gay people to give up to love their partner only because of law regulation. What I really couldn't agree with in this comment was that it take much time to discuss and amend the law about same sex marriage and this problem should not be discussed now because the government has many other problems to deal with. We cannot say like that because this is ONE BIG PROBLEM to solve. Any problems should be tackled as soon as possible because we cannot run away from problems.  I agree with legalizing gay marriage. We should not have a prejudice against homosexual person. I think that Whether or not to marry is individual freedom. Gay marriage will increase in the future.  I agree homosexuality because lave affair depends on will of the individual. However I disagree Mr. Obama's this decision. He use the problem of sexually to win the election. Gay suffer from the criticism of society long years and they fight to win theirs rights. I think Mr. Obama's decision makes fool of their suffering.  I agree to same sex marriage. Because, I think this is freedom of individuals. So I think government should be permit same sex marriage.  I don't agree with Obama. It's true that many form of love exist and I don't condemn itself, but Gay is ethically problematic. They can't leave offspring, so government shouldn't admit officially. That's the reason why I disagree with same sex couple marriage.  I agree with the idea. In the past, transsexualism was not admitted socially, so it was thought to be really strange thing to marry the same sex person. But as the science, especially medicine, developed, it has been scientifically admitted that there are people who cannot love different sex people. So, I think the marriage of gay person should be admitted.  I agree with legalizing same-sex marriage. Gay or lesbian people naturally have human rights. But in America, there may be many problems to solve. If most of those could be solved, the policy must be adopted at once.  I support Obama's decision and I'm sure it should be admirable! To begin with, it's strange that the government can obstruct individuals' marriage. We have right to get married with our lovers even he/she is the same sex of us. We should think about this problem again with this as a start.  I disagree with his/her comment. Everyone thinks if there two fathers and no mother in a family, children would confuse. I think, of course, children would confuse in Japan, and children even in America which is a melting pot of many races and a liberty country would confuse, too. However, that thought is wrong. Believing in a mother and a father in a family is not imaginable; conservative and outdated. These times, there is no impossibility in the world, I think. Therefore, of course, I agree with a same sex marriage and adopting a child between father and father. This is why I disagree with his comment.  It is sure that there are some people who are afraid of gay people, but I think many similar problems are there between men and women, so this cannot be the reason of banning same-sex  marriage. Besides, he admits that many gay people are proud of themselves. Can't this also be the reason of agreeing same-sex  marriage? So I disagree with this opinion.  The good point of this opinion is that the contributor admits that same-sex marriage problems are not so familiar to Japanese, and he mentions about the problems of human rights. This insistence is very clear and agreeable, so I choose this one.  Of course, There still be lot of other problems Obama must face and address, especially the current economic condition and the unemployment rate this country has.  That is because in Japan, Gay marriage may be regarded as ethically problematic, but in some countries, I think, it is no problem. I believe what people value depends on each person.  I think homosexuality should be permit.  I think if the gay marriage is forbidden, the marriage becomes only way of making legality children. I think living with his loving person is the happiest in his life, so maybe I love woman, but probably I love men. When that, I want to live with him if it isn't legality somebody says.  I disagree with the opinion that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc. This is because its thought is a kind of prejudice for gays. This is the first step to improve the surroundings of gays. If there are regulations for gays, it will leave room for prejudice. we should build equal society for all human beings.  It is said that it's the unrealistic problem. I think that it is because gay people are much smaller in Japan than US. Certainly, the number of gay people in Japan is smaller than US. But proportion is probably about the same, I think. And gay people in Japan are likely to hide their identity (loving same-sex  people). So it's just that we don't know about it, but they are everywhere. They are living, frightened whether their secret is out. We should turn our eyes to minority more. And I think it is the very biased view that same-sex  couple's adopting children will be bullying because they have no mother or father. This is discrimination against single mother or father's children, isn't it? I think same-sex  couple who loves their children heartily can overcome such things easily.  I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. The right of individual is most important. We must not restrain the rights in that the problem will happen .  I favor gay marriage. It is one of the human rights.  I agree this comment in that it mentions ""this is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. "" In fact, we seldom consider getting marry with same-sex partner as myself. However, world' getting more and more global, we should see things globally not only internal.  I disagree same-sex marriage. It's true that individual is free, but It makes social unstable. Gay is ethically bad cause they can't have offspring.  I think same-sex   couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex   couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex   couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex   couples should have the right to get married. I agree with this opinion. I think same-sex   couples should be able to get married, but shouldn't be able to have children, Because if a same-sex   couple has a child, there is a strong possibility that their child receive bad treatment.  I certainly agree with this idea, but it takes a long time to have consensus of its citizens. It is especially true to country like USA because this country is religiously strong rooted nation. But USA is the also the country that is acceptable to new concepts and they have been improving their country by themselves, so I believe that they can gradually have the right answer for this matter and I hope the government will help the minority to some extent.  All his words are what I would like to say. I would like to the society be freer for people who love the same sex because they have the right they can do so. It's a fine human right. The government should help them use the right. I think the suggestion in this comment is good to realize my ideal world. This is the reason I strongly agree with this comment.  I disagree with this comment because this comment opposes gay marriage. At this point, my opinion doesn't accord this comment.  I disagree with him because he violates gay people's human rights. He suggests gay people marriage should be banned for the birthrate. I argue this opinion is utilitarianism thinking. According to this logic, Majority people can violate minority people's human rights because of utility of entire society. This logic made a lot of problem in history. World war 2 is vivid example. And this kind of logic will violates minority's human rights.  I disagree with this opinion. Because I think that individual rights should be respected. In Japan, I felt that a fixed idea's strong that man and woman should marry. It is very important for us to respected the minority opinion.  I agree with Obama's opinion. However same sex marry is not accepted in Japan, same sex marry is proper. It is because they have right to get married with a lover.  He said ""the birthrate in the country may decline"" but if government ban the same-sex marriage, the problem can't solve. Moreover, this news is about America and the country which is declining birth rate is Japan. This opinion is not logically I think.  Her comment is correct. But there is no example about social problem. So this is bad as comment.  I agree gay marriage is individual free.  If they can't leave offspring, it should be depended on themselves whether they marry or not. The government should not say about citizens' opinion.  I've reminded of gays who play in television in Japan. At first, I feel them disgusting but, repeating seeing their video, I realize that they were criticizing gays either. At that time I was very impressed, and I really agree with the comment above.  Though I understand homosexual's position, however I think homosexual love is not to be yield. Before human came out to earth, there were no homosexual love but heterosexual love. In addition, having a homosexual love-life makes themselves make easy to get a disease. Moreover it makes birth rates to decrease. Therefore, It will be the big problem in the near future.  This kind of argument is clearly anachronistic, and the evidence which support his opinion is too illogical. I can't believe those who have old-fashioned opinion like this.  He don't explain why he thinks gay marriage is bad ethically, and I disagree with the idea that all living things must leave offspring. Is he living to leave offspring? I don't think so. All of us have the right to pursue our happiness!! I can't agree with the opinion that leaving offspring is the most important of loving someone.  I disagree with this comment. Because I think marriage is personal liberty. Though this comment points out 'If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture', I think it is not. Same-sex couples can adopt orphans and pay various taxes.  I don't think so. We can't deny their love and I want him to explain what is the ethical problem, what is your ethic. There are so many kinds of people and thoughts so we should think calmly.  I am in Obama side. I think gay or lesbian should be together if they love each other. Nothing can stop the feeling that you love someone. I also don't care that gay or lesbian got marriage.  I disagree with a part of her comment. She said that it will not happen that the marriage of gay couples should be admitted in the future. I disagree with this part. If the people get to understand more about the same sex couples and marriage, marrying of them is going to be natural thing. Most important thing is people need to understand them. I think it is possible.  I agree to same sex marriage as long as they do not take charge of children in anyway such as adopting etc. This is because I do not think same sex marriage is a natural thing and it could lead to bullying. If people want to make same sex marriages they should make their children involved in their self-satisfaction.  I just can't find what is wrong about same sex people having a marriages. If they love each other why can't they marry? If it comes to a problem of whether they can have adopted child , it is difficult. But I think there are some ways that same sex couple can have a child just like we talked during class. I thought it is funny that hotels is Disney Resorts Japan announced that they will permit gay marriage at their hotel, right after the day Obama announced that he supports gay marriage. Though they say it was just a coincidence.  This person has a same thoughts as mine and I liked the phrase ""It is free to love whoever. "" I hadn't known a gay marriage is prohibited in America, so I was really surprised when I read this article for the first time. I agree with Obama's opinions because the number of people who love same sexual people is more and more increasing recently. This problem is not familiar to us Japanese, but we have to think seriously about this because this is a matter of human right. It is very difficult to conclude this problem, but I wish gay people could express their love freely someday.  I agree with President Obama's idea that same-sex couples should be able to wed. We can't have right to deprive them of their happiness. Banning gay marriage leads to discrimination, which will violate human rights. It's sacrosanct in nature. We, our society, should admit diversity of values. As the Japanese proverb ""so many men, so many minds"" show, I believe there is no officially decided way to love others.  It's very difficult problem to solve in Japan, but I think same-sex  couples should be able to get married, or we should establish a alternative system like a marriage. For example, a same-sex  couple held a wedding ceremony at Tokyo Disney Resort. It's symbolic event. Marriage between people of the same gender or civil union win public recognition gradually. So we should have interest in this problem and protect their legitimate rights.  The idea that they're admitted to be equivalent to marriage and they can receive a certificate was approved at Shibuya last month. We can think about sexual minority's rights better to hear this news. But there're still many people thinking badly against them. So I think that we should solve this problem gradually, not radically.  I agree with you.  Gay marriage should be accept in Japan. There is no problem about it, but maybe not easy to ching some low. Because there is few people who against same-sex couple.  I think the activities of President Obama should be evaluated. Some people support same-sex marriage, some people oppose gay it. So, opposition to same-sex marriage is it that there is no way. However, if anyone does not act just because there is a dissenting opinion, the situation does not change anything. I think attitude to tackle actively the issue of same-sex marriage of President Obama is marvelous.  I totally agree with your opinion. In the current Japan, understanding of same-sex  couples have been gradually spread, I feel. The same-sex  couples will be able to get married, but there will be a variety of disorders, such as legislation and institutional reform. However, I think that same-sex  couples will be able in the future to be sure to get married.  Marrying same sex people may be strange. I don't understand this feeling, but I can accept it willingly, because there are many people all over the world.  Reading this article in this timing is kind of interesting because same-sex marriage has been finally legalized in the United States recently. I do not understand why there are opposing people though after reading this article and comment of a former governor. I think the law will just give people more choices or options and so I do not think other people cannot take their rights away.  I think this problem is very difficult. Now, not all people accept this, same-sex couple marriage. So even if the government allows this, those who are around them may speak ill of them or avoid them as so on. So, many people should know more about them.  In those days, the bill that the same-sex marriage is allowed in all the continent was passed in America. I think that this is very important thing for the world view of gay or lesbian. But, I also worry that people's view for them is more severe.  I think same sex marriage should be legal. And I should admit this issue. Same sex to give up get marry because it was illegal. But I think this idea is so bud. Couple is couple. I should be allied with love person. I think that it is include in a right of the freedom to recognize this.  I agree with you. These days, I hear the news about same sax marriage on TV or newspaper so often. I hope all the people live together even if they are same sex couple or not. "
JOC JOC-12B-05N 8.41 "I strongly object to the sentence of six Italian seismologists. It's true they failed to predict the large earthquake and some of people acted on the false information that they gave. However, a-six year prison and $17.7 million fine are too excessive. It's impossible for today's scientific technology to forecast natural disaster completely, especially earthquake or eruption. Usually, scientific techniques are testified so many times in order to ensure the safety and improve the accuracy. But large earthquake and eruption rarely occur and that means there a fewer chance to testify the techniques. So it's too severe punishing the scientists just because they failed to predict the earthquake. Furthermore, heavy penalties for false prediction can give bad effect on development of science. If some judges take a similar line, scientists are allowed to speak only collect things. Then scientists become likely to refrain from predicting unknowns for fear of being punished. Also young people avoid entering such area of science and consequently the number of researchers will decrease. So, severe penalties for false prediction can be blow to the growth of branches of science exploring unknowns. I hope the seismologists will turn out to be innocent and the scientific freedom will be ensured.  I think that the sentencing of six Italian seismologists should not be permitted. There are two reasons. First, scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. The evidence of it is ""freedom of expression"". All the people must have ""human rights"" that we have gained and possessed historically. Second, science has a possibility of developing our life. If some scientists who make a mistake by chance are punished, it must weaken their strong desires to study. That means our life quality will go down. So I think people who receive the the result of scientific research should be more carefully.  It is improper that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Earthquakes are natural phenomenon, so it is difficult to predict it. The other seismologists fare that predicting earthquakes. We should protect ourselves without the other people's help. Anyway, when a earthquake occurs, we must act quickly.  According to this article, six seismologists were sentenced six years in jail and ordered to pay more than nine million euros ($11.7 million). This is too strict for them I think. Science are changing and developing every each day. All scientists have rights to study and research new technology and this is scientific freedom. Not only the case of science but also other subjects, this right of freedom is existed. Italia should rethinks about this problem and also possibility of scientific field.  This news shocked me very much. The prediction of an earthquake, when to happen and how strong it will be, is not absolute. Therefore the scientists should not be blame for it. As Michael Halpern emphasizes, scientists need to, or have to announce what they know without feeling fear of being charged if their knowledge is not right. I think, in general when a disaster happens, people are apt to make it clear who is responsible for it, and accuse them of it. As a case in point, in Japan, when 3.11 earthquakes occurred, the public and media criticized Tokyo-Electric Power Company and governments, as if they had caused all the disaster including the earthquake.  I think that it is not good to pronounce scientists to prison sentences. Because it is natural for them to explore unknowns. If they are targeted by the verdict, they will search for many things which we do not know. I regard this situations as depriving the right to speak freely and independently. Provided this conditions are going to continue, I think that big epoch-making results will appear for a long time, so this time's ridiculous judgment should reconsider at once.  I think six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. Because it considers a man-made disaster. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information.  I think these scientists should be discharged. No matter how better the technology improve, human beings can't manipulate nature. Therefore, though scientists expect disasters, it is nonsense that the government put the blame on them. Not only that, this will cause depressions of science. I hope that the judgment will be overturned and they will keep on their studies.  I was very surprised at this news. It is impossible for humans to predict a earthquake correctly. So six scientists have no responsible. Such a thing won't cause good correspond. Italian should face this thing seriously. .  It is ridiculous to sentence scientists due to a misprediction of natural phenomena. They have a responsibility to evacuate people from a danger area even when they predict little chances of danger. Scientists will blamed by people even if they do not evacuate people since people will be disappointed with scientist's decision. This collision makes scientists to be in a dilemma. However, citizen's security is the most important thing to be protected. Therefore, scientists could not be blamed.  I strongly believe that to sentence the seismologists in jail and to fine them are too heavy punishment. It is true that the seismologists are to be blamed for their statements because they are the one of the only ones who can scientifically analyze or make a caution about the earthquake ( People are less likely to have knowledge about future earthquake). However, sentencing them in jail and fining them cannot be justified in terms of the right of freedom of expression. Everyone has the right to speak freely in public ( I don't include hate speech in this case) and without the right to speak freely and independently, the both sides, scientists and moderate people or people in public, would turn into chaos. In scientists case, for example, any new innovation such as more precise prediction of earthquake or weather forecasting or research into new drugs etc will be pushed off, which means that we cannot make any invention. In public case, for example, without having opportunity to gain new information about natural disaster, even it is difficult to predict or not, people will lack in information, and in extreme case, democracy which is assuring the freedom of expression will be infringed and will collapse. So considering from these arguments, I strongly oppose to the court.  Probably, Italy is going to secure the academic freedom. Most of countries, especially developed countries, secure academic freedom. Academic freedom is that any scholars, specialists can express and publish their research freely. Of course, there is asymmetry of information for science between scientist and ordinary people. But just because they have a lot of scientific knowledge it doesn't follow that they are prosecuted even if they publish the wrong opinion. They have great influence on their society. But their opinions are ""one opinion"". They also have a mistake. This is because they are not omniscient and omnipotent. As long as Italy protects academic freedom, scholars and specialists don't have to be sentenced. Secondly, the seismologists were sentenced by published that the earthquake does not happen. However, the announcement was published as the government's view. Why do the only seismologists have to take liability of the announcement? If they were prosecuted by the announcement, the government also should take responsibility of publishing the wrong opinion. The government just replaced the miss with the seismologists. So the government should apologize to the citizen for this case.  In my perspective, I disagree that scientists who misjudge the risk of an earthquake will be sentenced. It is because if scientists do not have the right to speak what they research freely and independently, they cannot share what they examine in addition to becoming meaningless of the research. Then that will prevent and decrease the progress of science. Besides, no one can predict when an earthquake would happen in the future, as the article said. In short, the scientists may be not guilty. In addition, Italy should concern how to recover the damage and treat the victims rather than the punishment of the scientists. It is because the most important thing for a democracy country is the nation. Besides, the scientists are probably innocent. However, Italy said that the scientists should be sentenced. I wonder what is ""little risk of damage"" that is in this news though. Obviously, this quake is very big; not little risk of damage. But if 50 people died of a quake, is that a big risk or little risk? And who decides whether a quake is little risk or not? The borderline between little or not is pretty vague; different people. So, scientists should not be sentenced.  It is impossible for me to understand the Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in jail for underestimating the risk of a 2009 earthquake. It is natural that scientist's expectation often prove wrong. I think that is Science.  Like other people said, I also disagree with 6 year sentence and $11.7 million fine to Italian scientist and government official. Our technology is not developed enough to completely predict what would happen in future, especially if that is environmental disaster. The government should always be ready for such disaster, and it's not right to sentence these six people. I wonder if these scientists predict there will be big disaster in near future, could government be prepared for that. For example, in Japan, scientist warned that there will be big earthquake. However, Japanese government didn't prepare for such disaster and caused lot of problem after 3.11.  It will not be possible that science can predict perfectly every natural disaster. It's just some opinions what scientists say, and it's depend on each person what they believe. I had thought like that. However, through the conversation in the last class, I came to think that we have no choice but to believe what the professionals say if we have no idea about specialist things. And professionals must know that we need their knowledge. Although the punishment of this time may be too hard for them, they have to have responsibility about their statements.  I think that it is impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs, even the seismologists because earthquake is a natural disaster. If people can predict when the natural disaster happens, a great number of people would survive when the huge earthquake happened on 11th of March 2011. It is impossible for them to estimate, so I think it is ridiculous that the seismologists were sentenced to six years in jail. I want them to be released from jail.  I do not agree with the verdict that Italian court did. It was a fact that the prediction scientists showed caused great damage. However scientists are very week against the power. The freedom of description is must been protected strictly. So I disagree against the punishment for scientists.  It is the world-shaking event I think. We can't understand technical matters, so we should believe the statement of specialist stuff. But after the matter like this, we don't know to do for our safety and will do wrong treatment. I think specialist stuff should have responsibility about their statement and their technical fields. And investigations should keep the peace and safety of the people.  I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens. I am consent at this opinion. Nobody understands a natural disaster. I think that an earthquake cannot be predicted similarly. It should be thrown into prison although there is some responsibility.  I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens.  I can't support this verdict. I think that this six Italian scientists must be found innocent and acquitted. They only announced their own research and earthquake reduction. They haven't done anything wrong.  I think it is not adequate that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Because it is difficult to predict earthquake damage. But I want seismologists to make an effort to analyze earthquake damage.  To predict the change of nature , such as earthquake is extremely difficult. So it is not apt to blame scientists. Earthquake is difficult to predict, so we should beware and prepare for it. Furthermore , we could say that it is important to do an accurate judgment which was not done at the 3.11.  I think the punishments are too harsh. It is impossible to expect a natural phenomenon perfectly, and it is the seismologist itself that is primarily disappointed rather than ours. Probably those who believe the scholar's idea in the back also decrease in number, I consider that it means they receive punishment enough.  Firstly, it's obvious that scientists are never prophets. If scientists were punished when they couldn't predict perfectly what happens in the future, who on earth want to be a scientist. Then, I'd like to see whether there were irrational purpose of Italian government, or, in fact, they hadn't prepared much for a big disaster so they turned their responsibility to those scientists. It's just possible that lots of people may hit upon this idea. If so, Italian government may lose their trust. I strongly think that governments should always be neutral and have some degree of cleanness for their nation.  I agree with ID12055 and ID12063's opinion. Nobody foresee the future perfectly. Needless to say, all researchers are human. Also human cannot avoid making mistakes. This judgment will restrain Italian researchers from research fully and the research of Italy will fall behind. This judgment should be reconsidered as soon as possible. However, researchers need to realize their responsibility. The general public tends to rely on them at the time of emergency. For safety of nation, they must not act irresponsibly.  i was very surprised when i read this news.  And i still cannot believe why did they have to go to jail and need to pay nine million euro. As it said on this news, i think it is scientist's job to tell what they know to other people who do not know.  I don't think the Italian six scientists have to be punished. Scientists always explore and foresee many things what may happen. It is natural works for scientists, I think. Also in Japan, after the 3.11, I have heard many forecasts about earthquakes. I think the scientists' forecasts make people prepare for the worst, and the preparations make people be safe.  There is no need of a scientist if people know whats going to happen in the future. Scientists job is to guess what could happen and they are not a prophet. This punishment is too strict and it is a shame for the scientists.  It is totally ridiculous that the six scientists were punished for underestimating the risk of an earthquake. No one can ever predict what happens especially when it is a natural disaster. If those six could estimate exactly how strong an earthquake is or what time, no one would have died in an earthquake. I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict.  I think this punishment was too strictly. If they kept doing this kind of thing, there wouldn't be any scientist or scholar who would try to alarm the earthquakes to us. As long as we live in the country where earthquake happens we should be prepared and the help of scientists would help us a lot.  I think this punishment is not illegal because the scientists tried to estimated and alarmed. They have no crimes. when earthquake occurred, we must prepare, be careful and protect ourselves.  I think that this judgment is amusing. Because, it is since a natural disaster is not what people can predict. Not a scientist but a public policy thinks that it is bad.  I think this punishment is wrong. We can not predict when perfectly natural phenomena such as earthquakes and typhoons will happen even if the technology developed . The scientist's punishment is illegal and it is not their responsibility. The punishment is too strict and should be reconsidered.  I strongly agree with the part that ""I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict. "" Judgment should consider victims' feelings, but scientists were not the criminals in this incident, I think. It can't be acceptable if trial thought they are the criminals so that they should be punished. Some may say that whether intentionally or not, they are criminals if they commit crimes. But I believe that people should also have had to consider that the scientist might make mistake. In that sense, I understand the victims' feeling, but it's foolish that only scientist should be blamed.  I disagree to the sentencing of six Italian seismologists because I think that the judge may bother publication of scientist. If their announces was wrong, they would be sentenced. It give scientists a lot of risk. So, they may not refrain from their new discovery or research. I think it will have a bad influence on the freedom of science study, advance in our life and human happiness.  It is unbelievable news. Where a natural disaster is concerned, we cannot estimate completely what will occur. Surely no one should speak about matters of great importance hastily and thoughtlessly. But scientists need to be able to keep researching and share what they know. If they lose the right, the scientific development will stop. So I think they should not have been punished for their right to research and our future.  I feel it's very regrettable of the decision. It may give ""chilling effects"" to other scientists. People should realize that there is a limit even to science, and should judge all the research results by their own risk.  After this judgment, many people point out freedom of expression has been damaged. Surely, this situation could be a problem of freedom of expression, which is the right that everyone should be able to say what they want, without fear of persecution. But I think pointing out focusing on only freedom of expression in this situation is out of focus. I think this situation is more of a problem of objectivity in science rather than freedom of expression. Because modern science is getting more complicated and unpredictable, the question if science is value-neutral  or not has become a central point of controversy. I think science is value-neutral . Also, the point of this situation is that the Italian scientists got convicted because of communication, not science. If the scientists explained the results more minutely, people would have been able to understand the situation and prepare for the danger to the best of their ability. But the only thing the scientists said when they explained their results was that everything was 'safe'. This is the reason why people are angry. They did not explain the risks and possibilities in detail even though they knew there is no such thing as being 100 percent sure of results as a scientist. Resultingly, they did not perform their duties as scientists. Taking this incident as an example, society should change the method in which scientific decisions are communicated. As I mentioned above, science is value-neutral . Therefore, there should be lot of verification and discussion when applying scientific results which can make a huge practical influence on society. Also, civil society should verify if scientists announced the results truthfully and correctly without any political pressure. Professor Sheila Jasanoff from Harvard University who researched about scientists in law and politics said it is reasonable to investigate scientists' original results after they have been interpreted by people. For example, in 1989 scientists announced that BSE will never infect humans; therefore, many people believed their results and ate the infected beef. However, because many people died of BSE in 1990, people in England investigated the results that were announced in the same year. As a result, civil society and government of England revealed the scientists were wrong and republished the report in 2000.  Generally people knows predictions on earthquake is impossible. Therefore, thr\ere must be few people trusted the prediction, be little damage for society. In addition, I think these scientists didn't have ill will. There is no reason to consider them as guilty.  I agree to Michael Halpern's term, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" Because, we can know various problems and solutions by the action of scientists.  Michael Halpern said, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" I think this is true, and this is the ideal type of the scientists. They should be brave enough to tell their predictions to save people. However this is only an ideal and it's clear that not everybody can be like this. . . . . or maybe no one can be. Who would like to take a risk to say wrong things in public? To solve this problem, I recommend to make a environment that one can easily say their thoughts aloud.  I strongly oppose to the sentence. It is natural that companies which neglect to confirm security of their products are punished for the accidents which caused by their product, but earthquake is natural disaster, so there's no one who responsible for it. Seismologists should be appreciated when they predicted earthquakes, but they should not be punished or blamed when they couldn't predict earthquakes.  I think these researchers very poor. It is difficult to predict natural phenomena. I think this decision is wrong.  I was shocked to hear the news. Science doesn't have absolute perfection. No one doesn't fail. Scientists shouldn't be criticized and we shouldn't depend on only science.  Six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information.  I think this punishment is surprising and I don't agree on it. It's impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs precisely. If that decision were correct, reporters of the weather forecast must quit there jobs.  When I read the news, I was really surprised and shocked. It was sad to hear that lots of people were died 'cause of the earthquake, believing the words of the scientists that the place was free from the fear of the earthquake. But, think again. Can u believe the words of them 100 percent? Let us recall the casualty which happened in Japan on 11th Mar. 2011. Most of us believed that the nuclear plant was safe even if the earthquake happened. But actually. . . it was not. So, even the scientists or experts cannot completely expect what's gonna happen. I do not wanna say that we should not believe in them 'cause of such thing. I just feel we cannot say their words are not 100 percent correct. However, it is obvious that we are relying on science nowadays. If we restrict the freedom of the speech of the scientists, we cannot make use of them. So such thing should not be happened although they cannot predict all the thing.  I could not believe this news when I first watched it on TV. This decision is as incoherence as ""fen shu keng ru""(this means ""burning books on the Chinese classics and burying Confucian scholars alive""), which the first emperor of China did. I didn't think such a crazy sentence was passed in the present, scientific time.  I agree with the comment. Michael Halpern of the US -based Union of Concerned Scientists said that ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know-without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not hold up"" in this article. I think too. Scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. I think scientists have a right to research freely.  It is impossible to predict when and where earthquake occur perfectly. We know that after the big earthquake hit Tohoku and Kanto area in Japan in 3.11. Therefore, it is strange to press all responsibility against scientists who could not predict the earthquake completely.  We have no means of predicting natural phenomena completely. If people were able to make an accurate of natural phenomena, we would not be sustained any damage caused by catastrophes. The Italian scientists should have admitted their underestimating and offered a comment on it modestly. After all, no matter how detailed they know about nature, there are no methods to predict disasters. If scientists are afraid of being censured about wrong predictions, the number of seismologists may be on the decline.  I don't think the scientists don't have responsibility at all. It was the matter about our lives so I don't want them to say such thing without responsibility. They should say with ""may"" and explain their study hasn't finish, because we are ignorant enough to believe the saying of officials.  Almost the same to mine. And I do think we should protect ourselves on our own.  I think the verdict is unreasonable because it is next to impossible to predict when an earthquake would take place. So we cannot blame scientists, but we can hope them to predict more correctly.  I think we should think and act by ourselves. In this society, we cannot completely rely on someone or something.  I guess predicting earthquake is very difficult because it is natural disaster. Even if the technology developed conveniently, i think we never know about natural disaster. it is ridiculous sentencing seismologists for underestimating the risk of the earthquake.  I think no one can predict when the earthquake happens therefore, the scientist don't need to take the responsibility.  I think that the scientists are completely innocence, too. A court in Italy should withdraw this decision.  Freedom of science must be assured by governments. But this is thing that we must criticize. And the science of earthquake and other disaster may save a lot of lives. When I read this news, I remind the day of 311. I think tremendous numbers of people could save their lives. Government must restrict the freedom of science, This news is out of problem. And I hope such thing must not happen in the future.  When I knew this news, I thought that I was very sorry for scientists. It is impossible to completely predict the natural phenomenon. Therefore I think that it is mean to file a suit against it even if a prediction came off. It is responsible to the people who completely believed the prediction. Such a thing never wants you to get up.  I agree with this comment because I think freedom for the scientists to say their research should be protected from another power. You could not deny that that sentence become the precedent for disturbing the freedom.  I strongly agree with ID12063's comment. It is difficult to predict when the natural disaster will occur, even the scientists. I think I would believe what the scientists say because I do not have the perfect knowledge about the earthquake. I understand that sometimes the natural disaster do not occur even though they said it will occur. However I do not think that they should be put in jail.  I can't believe the decision oh the court. scientists didn't commit a crime. Now, the technique of science is developing. But scientists are not god. So it is impossible that at any time, to predict when and where the earthquake happens, how much damages the earthquake causes. Because earthquakes are natural disaster and acts of God. So I think scientists were not responsible.  This article is about predict of earthquake so our Japanese inevitably remember the 3.11 earthquake. Recently, some scientists presented the predict of the quake in Nankai Trough. If the real earthquake is more severe than the prediction of scientists , can we condemn them? The scientists have duties to investigate the tragedy and alarm the people. This responsible is hard and should be carefully taken by them. But they are obliged to make the predict excessive if they are criticized by the failure of underestimating. If so, they can't publish what they think. Academic progress can be done by many failures. In seismology, this theory is applied, too.  I completely agree with her. I also think we should not stop their researching and development of scientific technique. And so their human rights should be protected. Certainly, sometimes even they make mistakes. But I think there is a lot of truth in what they say. They are superior to other people in a field of science. So we cannot but trust them when an emergency arise.  This article made sad. And, I can't understand why the six Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in and ordered to pay more than nine million euros in damages. They arrive at an prediction by using daily observation and research. They have been trying hard. I think it is cruel that we let them all responsibility.  I disagree with the judgment and feel pity for the seismologists. So that a natural disaster is called an ""act of God"", it is very hard for human to predict an earthquake correctly. We can make an effort not to suffer as slight damage from a disaster as possible. However, once it happened, there is nothing you can do for it. You cannot stop it. Therefore, I think that the seismologists do not have to be responsible for the earthquake.  Many people say that these punishment is too hard and I think so, too. The failures scientists made is not good thing but it is unreasonable to put them into jails. The act which scientists have to do is trying to make more correct predict for the next earthquake.  This is very surprising news for me. It is impossible for any excellent scientists to predict an earthquake perfectly. Scientists don't have to be jailed because they have the right to speak freely and independently.  Being able to predict an earthquake should only be a reference so I find it harsh that the semiologist were blamed for not predicting an earthquake correctly. As it says in the article, this will lead to restricting scientists from expressing freely.  As I commented on the blog, Scientists should be given the freedom for developing the field.  It was shocking that scientists became guilty because of filing prediction of earthquake. Human cannot control nature, and it is not their responsible. I think it is right to against to the verdict.

JOC JOC-12B-09O 8.54 "I do not agree with ID12059's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. Of course it is a serious problem that Mr. Abe resigned from president because he had a disease. However, according to William Saroyan, a man of ability can learn a lot from failures. This statement apply to Mr. Yoshida. After he resigned from president, he had been president again. Eventually, he took Japanese independence back. He learned a lot from failures. This example will apply to Mr. Abe. I believe that he will do good job. I hope Japanese people believe that too.  I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout, not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required.  Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11. They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call ""abenomics"". I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and South. We must compare territorial problem with east asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation, and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own.  Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-defense Forces to be National Defense Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time.  I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr. Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.  Abe lost election six years ago. I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do. But this time, he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted.  Recently, the relationship between Japan and China is getting worse. Moreover, Japanese economy falls into deflation. Japan is under crisis now. I expect a lot from Abe in terms of improving Japanese recession.  I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.  I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems.  I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields. "
JOC JOC-13B-03N 9.91 "Of course I think drone should not be used. There are three reasons for that. First, I think the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. Users of drones do not have to go to the field of war and can live everyday lives after their work. Second, I think that people can trigger wars easily if drones are used because no people of one's own country would die. Third, because of inaccuracy of drones , many civilians are killed indiscriminately. To decrease the use of drones, I think that America must cooperate because America have so many drones. To attain that, UN should try to regulate the power of America in the UN. If that can be achieved, situations may be improved somewhat.  I have read this article, I remembered the Nintendo War. To kill a lot of people, using missiles feels a guilty feeling less than to kill a human with knife. It would give us a little guilty to kill people even by using unmanned aircraft. Even more it is absurd that citizens became victims. I don't believe in peace which is brought by military power.  I think drone strikes is the epoch-making method to kill the people, exactly. Because the company can alive by using this method even when we kill a lot of people. So, I understand that the Obama administration escalated the use of it little bit.  I think it is difficult to decide which is justice about this problem. Drone strikes, UAVs, is the methods the U. S have used in order to counter terrorism. It is not easy for them to replace it by using other means. This problem will be debatable for along time.  I was surprised at the news. I think that the drone strike is very dangerous weapon. By using drone strikes, many people are killed without difficulty. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It is so far to come the peaceful world.  I was surprised at the case that many citizens has become victim to drone strikes. The report said ""Drones can reduce the damage of citizens depending on how. "", as long as victims of more than 400 people have come up to now, there is no difference to be dangerous. At the same time, a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. Therefore, we should be considered how to make useful citizens, instead of hurting the citizen.  Is the use of drone strikes good for peace? When I read this article, such question crossed my mind. Before, my answer to this question was absolutely ""No"" because I didn't think that killing people was the best way to maintain public order. Then, I got confused because I could kind of understand the US argument, reading the article. However, I still have the same answer. We shouldn't use drone strikes so much. I think drone strikes can promote war because they are unmanned weapons. Such weapons may lighten the guilty feeling. Of course, to punish radical terrorist, it sometimes needs to use such weapons, but it had a risk of involving innocent people. That's why I think we should refrain from using drone strikes.  When I read this news, I remember Three Laws of Robotics. This law tells ""A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. "" Actually, many people think this law is a fancy. To sum up, a robot can not keep this rule. If we use drone and UAVs, we must be careful about not be out of control.  I was shocked by reading the following passage. It is said that Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004. Up to 2200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 civilians. Knowing this fact, I do not think drone strikes should be accepted for now. It is because so many innocent people have been killed due to the strikes. I know that they are necessary for Americans to prevent terrorism, but I feel that they should think other ways unless remotely piloted aircrafts are dangerous. Other than that, the American government would be able to use those improved enough to handle safely. For example, American forces can operate some sort of system that predicts unusual situation to prevent attacks scientifically. If science develops more, I believe it could be done.  Americans love to be a ""hero"" but they need to think about what ""justice"" they are fighting for.  I think that using drone have both negative point and positive point. First, negative point is guilty conscience. Of course, murder is heavy crime, so people who remote control drone do not kill others directly. As a result, they do not feel guilty conscience. Second, positive point is the number of casualties. Drone is unmanned vehicle. Therefore, if drone was broken, nobody died. In conclusion, I agreed using drone in order to counter terrorism, because it makes the number of casualties decrease.  I really feel frustrated every time I hear of a I feel really frustrated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military. And that's one of my greatest conscious. Well well indeed , those drones and other military technology shows the nation's power and how great the US is. But that's all. The US haven't gained any other power to solve international issues. The US haven't changed since 9.11 . US should search other way to show the strength of the US.  I think this problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. The one thinks it is the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives and safety, the other thinks using the drones is only to protect the country and civilians so stopping using them can't allow. It is difficult to use them with no victims. the happening without intentionally can not be avoided. We should find the point of compromise between ""military"" and ""civilian safety"".  When I read this article, I was very shock. I didn't know that UAV has been made and killed a lot of civilians already. I had thought such a vehicle is not made for a long time. I oppose using such an UAV. Surely the pilots who died by a battle will decrease. However citizen dies as ever, and war will become easy to happen. So I can't agree to it.  Even if the strike is safer than traditional methods, actually, it made civilian casualties. So the Obama administration can't say it is one of means to counter terrorism. The strike causes damage to citizen and it isn't effective in protecting them. The violence produces the violence again and it is vicious cycle. I think the best way to solve the problem of terrorism is discussion, but it is true that this method is difficult. So America should offer information people need at least. The lack of transparency makes people uneasiness.  I don't agree with the use of drone strikes. There are two reasons. First, the drone have the lack of judgment. In my opinion, the machine won't judge who are a non-combatant exactly even if it is difficult for human to judge exactly. So the drone will not keep the international law. As a result, a lot of non-combatants may be killed at random by drone. Second, the drone cannot be immune to breakdown. Drone is machine, and nobody knows the time when the machine is out of order. So the drone should not be used.  I was surprised and terrified by reading this article. America uses the drone strikes under the pretext of counter-terrorism. But actually they use it to make their profit, for instance economical profit. In spite of this situation, more and more American ordinary people lend their hands to the government to do the drone strike. I think they did it like playing game because they cannot see the situation which is attacked by drone strike. In addition, it is so difficult to have sufficient evidence. I think if we do not touch the problem, only America makes their profit and the number of civilian casualties will increase. So, I do not agree with the use of drone strikes and we need measures to deal with the situation soon.  I'm living peacefully in Japan thinking like no more danger to be involved in some war. I consider the world war two last big one for us, because people in the world experienced the worst tragedy ever. But it doesn't seem to be true. It's possible to happen some tragedy again, actually terrible things are still on in the other part of world, though I haven't experienced but only watched them on TV. We must learn from the past and mustn't repeat mistakes by cooperating one another all around the world. I hope that nowadays' great technology of human such as drone will be used with proper way and the world will be changed better without wars.  This is so difficult problem. Certainly, it's important to attack without risk of attacker, but it's limited only if attacker is absolute justice. But, there are not such as absolute justice. US and terrorist have a reason to attack somebody. Of course terrorist's reason is unacceptable. I think US is attacking to help civilian, but if they're killing innocent, it's same as terrorism. If drone strike kill many civilian, US have to stop attacks by UAVs. However if US do nothing to these country, many civilians will be killed by terrorist. My opinion, US drone strike is not guilty, but it must stop, and many country (not only US) have to think and act about this problem.  Even if whatever reasons there is, I think, we should not injure or hurt other people. Drone strikes can injure people easily. The people attack need not go to the front. Of course, I oppose that going to the front and attacking. I hope there would be no arms all over the world.  I'm afraid that attacks to people steadily escalate because drone strikes are very ""effective"" to kill a lot of people. We can do that very easily by drone, if we hope. It's very awful circumstance. According to the article, in the world, 2200 people have been killed. This number was made by that ""easiness"", I believe. I hope humans stop to pursue it, noticing its awfulness.  I am against to use drones. It is so easy to kill people and the consciousness of killing people is so week when you use drones. It is so terrible that one can kill people without conscience even if casualties are terrorist. I hope the drones will be abolished When I read this article for the first time, I was only opposed to the drone strikes and Obama's policy. But after reading your opinion that mentions other good way to use drones, I couldn't help changing my opinion that oppose drones perfectly. But it is natural that the latest skills are always used to injure people. They must understand better way to use such skills.  It's difficult problem. If a weapon becomes unmanned the dead people of the friend soldier decrease. However, more citizens will die of it. Because as a result, weapons increase. US become in danger to keep peace. I have a doubt to keep peace whether such many weapons are necessary.  I felt anger with such dangerous weapons and Obama's escalating. Of course such skills are useful and epoch-making. So we can find better way to use them, for example, to make them work in dangerous places like atomic power plants. If we think others each other, we can prevent accidents easily.  I think this problem is odd. To begin with, I can't understand why many countries permit foreign country's attack. A state have sovereignty. I feel drone's attack infringe sovereignty. But America justify drone's attack by insisting ""world police"". I will not grant the present situation that we can't help depending on America's army power.  I don't oppose the use of unmanned aircraft. This is because riding a bomber plane long time is dangerous for the pilot. But in this matter, I think the United States is wrong. Whatever reason there is, killing civilians is not allowed absolutely. Drone strike may reduce sacrifice of American soldiers, but the operation should be carried out very carefully.  Of course, I think the drone must not be used. However, if the war continue, drone might be used because by using drones can save lives of offense side country's soldiers. The war kills both sides people, but they hope nobody get hurt. In order to stop using drones, we must end the war.  Drone strikes is a weapon to kill a lot of people. This weapon is too dangerous to use. However, drone strikes has many way to be used. People should consider how to use it. Drone strikes can be a device to help people, but it can be also a weapon.  The way of US sometimes kills a lot of innocent people. Drone can be the tragedy like Iraq War , but if this incident can be justified or not is uncertain. I think this should be carefully watched.  I think drone strikes had better not be used. But it is an ideal. They are very strong and safe for user. Because pilot is not necessary. So people will use them if government deny them. I think government should limit the size of them or amount of explosive. If do it, damage will be small!! I think American's mention is selfish and not reasonable. In fact, considering of casualty, they don't see the real that are caused by UAVs in drone strikes. In addition, they should recognize that their action violate international humanitarian law. If they think it should be America that lead the world, they have to think what is real safe.  I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they save a lot of soldiers' life. If the USA throw soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply.  I was surprised for me to read this report. Many people are dead when A attacks. And the civilian is also dead. The side which surely is attacked is safe. However, the side attacked is dangerous. A will surely be used more. The civilian must be made not to be attacked.  USA has played a important role in the international power relationship. The overwhelming military power has allowed US to do that, and yet that overwhelming monopoly of military power has caused controversy in all times. Drones may be discussed as a issue now, but as time goes by the argument will vanish and fade away.  I was very surprised to read this article, also I was sad. I do not think USA should use drone strikes any more. Many innocent people have died because of the bomb. I strongly believe that we cannot end war by using such dangerous weapons.  I was surprised at this news. This problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. I think it's the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It's so far to come the peaceful world.  I think escalated the use of drone strikes is not acceptable. I have a reason for this. The reasons is that using drones don't make the users of them feel guilty, because the users don't have to go to the killing fields by themselves. Because of the reason, I'm against the use of drones.  I agree to the contents of the first paragraph. It may be necessary by any chance. However, the authorities must not injure an innocent citizen and will lose trust if they do such a thing. They will regret that they judge decision to make harm on people. I can not understand the reason why they want to use drone strikes for by all means. And, I think the people objecting to the dangerous policy of the authorities should insist more.  America says drones are used to counter terrorism, but I think there is a paradox. Drone strikes made so many casualties in the world. Innocent civilians having been killed generates grudge and hate against America. This cause to grow up expected terrorists. You should think about what you deal with. Though drone have no life, there are many lives and human's emotion in the attacked area. I disagree the drone which makes negative feelings in peoples mind and new terrorists.  I do not think that the arguments about drones will vanish and fade away. The reason is that I think that in the future, the number of drones will be increased and almost all the wars will be occurred by using drones because of the development of the science. I think that drones make war easy thing and bring less guilty feeling to the operators. Therefore, many more drones in the future must emphasize these negative points more than now.  Now, Drones is used some countries. A few days ago, China's army said if the Self- Defense Forces shoots down the drones of China, China will attack Japan. Drones has no people and don't catch by radar, so they can invade other country easily. I think Drone strikes should be limited, because they sometimes be causes of war. Terrorism should be prevented by other ways.  I agree his opinion. The contents of Three Laws of Robotics is so important. A robot is made by humans. So, robot should be benefit to humans. Why people made UAVs? UAVs are weapons to kill people. It's contradiction. Humans make a robot to kill humans.  I insist that the use of drones should be ended right now. This is mainly because it makes soldiers be lack of senses of killing people and guilty, and thereby increases the number of civilian casualties. Actually, the Gulf War, being also called Nintendo War after using missiles and drones, had more civilian casualties than usual wars. The same can be said of Iraq War. Soldiers only use monitors to decide where to launch missiles and drones, and after that, only press a button to exterminate the place. It kills many people regardless of his or her sex and age. This indiscriminate killing should be strongly punished. To prevent the miserable killings, UN should constitute the international laws which bans the use of drones and punish soldiers who kills many civilians.  This news surprised me, because the US, which has the biggest influence on the General Assembly in the UN, was accused of its military action. The US has attacked many countries to counter terrorism and to protect people from a tyrant, as if it was the world police. However, even if its purpose is to make peace, relying on weapons cannot be a solution. Moreover, thousands of civilians have been killed in drone strikes. This will create new hatred between people or nations so that conflicts will never end. The UN General Assembly should stop relying on the US army and should take an alternative way to counter terrorism.  I think that Drone strikes is that it is not really good. An uninhabited airplane will be able to kill people. War may become game feeling. And a civilian's victims will further increase in number. This is not allowed even if it is the United Nations. I want to Drone strikes were disappeared all over the world.  Drone strikes is really make this world peace? It if fact that sometimes force is needed, but now we don't want all world to war. Specifically, when America did strike syria, they were accused and their people felt sad of own country's action. I think America should not repeat same fail.  I do not agree with your opinion. Whatever reasons USA has, the way that uses weapons should not be justified.  Drones is easy to kill people, so I think using drones is very dangerous, too. But a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. So I guess it can't hurt to think another method of using.  Whether or not Drone strikes violate international law , it should not be justified because it can kill a lot of people. Excessive military technology may cause new collision and war and so on , I think.  Always I think ""what is the justice?"" when I read the news like this article. Often the US hero movie write ""hero's enemy is full evil"" but it is impossible. Everybody who is doing war, believe ""I am the justice!"" so I think this issue is difficult.  I knew Drone by this article. I think USA should stop using Drone. Because it bombs by only sensing a block of body temperature. So Drone kills many innocent people meaninglessly. And USA government conceals its information. I wish that Japan doesn't become as USA by adopting secret law.  The Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004, Up to 2, 200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 were civilians. And in Yemen, as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs. This information was shocked to me. Why are innocent of civilians killed? Drone strikes are really dangerous. That is true, but it is difficult to extinguish them completely.  I agree with your opinion. It is difficult that human judge the weapon like drone strikes is bad or not. However, we should prevent from using dangerous weapon. I don't agree with the use of drone strikes.  I'm sure technologies have been improved very much these days, but a drone, remotely piloted aircraft is still too early to actually use. Of course, if we can succeed in making perfectly safe airplanes controlled by machine, that's better. However in fact it is endangering many civilians' life now. Under this situation, to continue using drones is too risky for America's dignity. Although some might say America no longer has its dignity, I think America still takes big leadership in the world. I want American government to bravely stop using drones at once.  I disagree with your opinion. No matter what efforts we made, the war would never disappear. This is evident from the history. Unless we threw away the concepts of state and race, we would fight each other. Therefore, using drones should be banned because it makes more civilian casualties.  I was very surprised at the truth that such many civilian casualties hurt by drone strikes there were. Because we live in a peaceful and quiet country, Japan, we tend to be ignorant about terrible matters in the world. In order to realize world peace, we must concern about incidents all over the world as widely as possible.  I sympathized your opinion about the gap of guilty feeling between killing by a missile and that by a knife. Attacks from the sky reminds me of a game.  It is natural that the drone strikes violate international law, I suppose. It's like the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and , to put it in an extreme way, the simultaneous terrorism that attacked America in 2001. Citizens of countries attacked by drone strikes didn't know when it would be dropped. It is very shameful that the country that suffered the sorrows of indiscriminate killing became an indiscriminate killer.  I agree with you. Of course, I hope humans stop to war and stop to make arms. However I think that a weapon will not disappear. The people will say, ""it is for peace"".  I'm interested in this news. This is because I don't think drone strikes make world's peace. Also I fear about it will violent international law. Also the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. It is really dangerous for human moral. so that I want US government will stop to use drones.  Is it good for people to use drone strikes? I think this is a really difficult question and I don't think there is a right answer for that. I always feel really complicated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military. Drone strikes can kill the people who is innocent, so I think it is not good for them to use drone strikes. I know it will be hard but I want American government to stop using it once.  I always feel fearful when I read the article of foreign country. I never see the word ""kill"" or ""die"". I don't understand about a foreign situation, but I want foreign country be peace like Japan.  White do you think more important, our freedom or security? I think security is more important. The law will save our security. So I agree with it.  I agree with your opinion. US is the one of the most powerful nation, so US ought to consider world peace. However, these weapons may go out of control. They are dangerous weapons for us.  I agree with your opinion. We should oversee their way to use it I think it is very difficult problem and much to be discussed. For sure, USA may violate the international law, but also there're no other means to defeat the terrorism.  I was very surprised to read this article because I did not know UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). It is too cruel because civilians never defend from such attacks. I also think Obama doing a good work but I wonder why a United Nations cannot move more. A United Nations should also take against the terrorism.  I think so. I want to keep peace without new weapons. I don't agree with Obama's policy.  Yeah I agree with you. This kind of problem is not simply about justice or people's right or something like that. It is true that those weapons are cruel, cowardice, savage. It really sucks. But the fact that the US are the leader to fight terrorism and the US uses those weapons to counter terrorism are unshakeable. To change this situation other countries should gain power in the counter-terrorism field and try to regulate or supervise the abuse of those weapons by the US.  I agree with you. We have to find better way to solve this problem. This problem is very difficult, but we should not compromise to die many people. We have to think more and more.  I think so, too. The man cannot help feeling the direct attack is heavy and the indirect attack is light. Because the man cannot feel indirect event as heavy accident. So we should more think about this indirect war.  I also think it is a difficult problem to solve and I don't think there is an answer. We need to try to find better answer.  I agree with your opinion because I believe there must be a way to settle this problem without fighting. I don't want anyone to be killed or injured because of drone attacks. Because of these reasons, I'm against the use of drones.  I agree with you. It is difficult to make one answer. We should think more deeply about this problem.  I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I wish to be found the point of compromise between ""military"" and ""civilian safety"".  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should have consciousness of murder not to be cruel murderer.  I disagree with you. Of course there are no war, drone aren't used. But in actually, the war never ending and drone was needed. So the most argent task is eliminate sad civilians killed by drone. America should stop the using of drone immediately.  I also think it is difficult problem to be discussed. But I want foreign country to move peace.  I agree with your opinion . It is true that drone is useful. However people can kill human easily. so, I think we should deracinate drone as soon as quickly.  US should terminate thing like this. they always stimulate other countries and lead to war. If this occurred, the world would be more peaceful.  I was shocked by reading the following passage. The strike causes damage to citizen and it isn't effective in protecting them.  I totally agree with you. I think it must be prohibited to use drones.  I don't think so. I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they don't commit war crimes. If the USA throw many soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply.  I was very surprised to read it. And I think it is too difficult to decide the justice about them. Because we do not know what we should consider as important.  I think so. America want to be a ""hero"". But I think America should consider not only American life but also other countries' people's life! I disagree with you. I think drone strikes are necessary for us. Because drone strikes will defense our country. But we don't use it to attack country. Drone strikes are necessary for us!!!!! I agree with you. It is difficult to answer. Maybe no one can judge which is right. We should think more deeply about this problem and manage to solve problem.  I think so. Japanese media should report more information about world like this, but it's also important that we get news by ourselves from foreign media.  I agree with you. This problem is so complicated. US have to use drone to save the lives of their people. It is not easy for US to dispose the weapons. To dispose it, they have to end the war.  I think so too. I want to keep peace. Any counties should get rid of weapons. (I couldn't log in my account. ) I agree with you. We play many TV games on war, but it's real to happen in the world in this moment. It's really horrible and we have to stop it.  I completely agree with you. SIt is impossible to make America stop using drone. It's sad but true. So America should decrease the use of it gradually.  [shiwori's comment]Americans love to be a ""hero"" but they need to think about what ""justice"" they are fighting for. reply [my thought It's too philosophical to discuss calmly the issue of drone. Although Justice is interesting and academic issue , I think we shouldn't discuss justice in this article. I disagree the drone , of course all of the competition by military power. It can be said an ideal , but I don't want to throw away the ideal and want to be an adult who can think logically and practicably about war.  I disagree with you on the positive point of using drone that you think. I expect that some or many people may be killed when drone brakes. Because drone goes everywhere without a pilot, it could destroy buildings or strikes people unintentionally. They could bring great suffering of innocent people, so I think every drone should disappear.  Look back history of war, the new technology or weapon is certainly abused for the war potential. It is true that UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is very useful if each country makes use of it properly. I'm worried each country abuse it for the war and the situation gets worse.  I agree with you. It may be wrong the solution of stopping the war is military power. It is difficult to solve such a problem.  Drone strikes may decrease the risks of its soldiers, but the problem is at the same time they make it easier to attack other countries, cities, and people. Because of drones, I think, the structure of human fight is changing. People have had guns and they attack people to protect their lives and families and countries. But drone strikes are committed by few, powerful people. Force of national army is getting absolute power, and I think the way we live and fight will be strongly influenced by it.  Drone strike is effective way strategically, and it can also reduce the number of soldiers who are killed in action. Therefore, citizens support the way better than previous way. Of course, we shouldn't break out any war, but it is extremely hard to achieve. So I think making the rule about drone strikes is needed and it will be made soon.  I think We should not use unmanned aerial vehicles. If pilot controls plane, it don't attack civilian by mistake. But drone may attack civilian by mistake. It is very dangerous. So I think we should not use drone to keep civilian's safe.  I agree with you. It is difficult to solve. Through a debating, We have to find better way to solve this problem.  I'm against with your opinion that drone strikes are necessary for us. I believe we can defense country without using drones , and we should find better way to prevent country from arracks without using drones.  I agree with you. I also think this incident is so frightening. For the future, we should talk and improve how to use drone! I don't think so, the US have not shown the power by the military technology. Recently, the US have not won any war completely. Iraq, Afghanistan. More worse, the US couldn't use the military power to Syria. Actually the US has the strong power, but doesn't use the power effectively.  I think this is very controversial problem. At a glance, unmanned aerial vehicles are so innovative. This machine has chance to lead to technical progress. But it is bad to use this new technology for the way goes against justice. We must deal with technology carefully.  They lost sight of justice. Such childish heroism is no use.  When I read this article , I thought that Drone strikes and lacking of transparency are not really good. but, this is too difficult to decide the justice. . . "
JOC JOC-13B-07N 8.99 "I was surprised to hear that. I think this State Secrecy Bill is needed in Japan. It is because Japan does not has one. According to this article, this new bill will encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. In order to counter Korea and Chinese and terrorists, it is also needed. I agree with it.  I am afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. I want the lawmakers to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately in order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution.  In my opinion, I think the law is needed Japan today because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. We have to protect the important information. Indeed the freedom of the citizens is also important but the security of our country is more, I think.  I felt a bit nervous when I heard this news. I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation. However , it is not a proper time to approve a law which deeply related to trust against the nation. After the nuclear power plants problem, the government has lost its trust deeply , because of the concealment of accurate information of the problem. As long as the people doubt the nation and unless the government improves its behavior, this kind of law may threaten freedom or right to know about necessary information. The law is necessary but not now, I think.  I think state secrecy bill threaten the our right-to-know. If this bill carried out, the government easily hide disadvantageous information, for example, nuclear power plant. Also, that means that the government change information. Under this bill, we cannot get correct information. We can say that this bill is a breach of the constitution.  I thought this bill should be discarded. Shinzo Abe said this bill was needed in Japan because we shred secrets with allied countries. But I think that for example, U. S have a state secrecy bill though they have also a sunshine law ( a public information act ). In Japan, we don't have enough a public information law. This law's definition of secrets is unclear. So I think this bill must be discarded now! I oppose to the bill. I think we have rights to access national information. The law infringes on our rights and this situation may be touch-and-go to make Japan a despotic state. My dream is to be a journalist and to report information for good life of everyone, so I am concerned with the problem about this law very much.  When this bill takes effect, of course people will not be able to access the information which the state recognizes secret one. For example information about nuclear power plants. Therefore the arguments of the anti-nuclear activists will be suppressed because they can not get information which bases their claims. I think this situation breaks the constitution of Japan, freedom of thought. So this law violates the fundamental human rights. I think that Prime Minister Sinzo Abe should reconsider about the role of the constitution of Japan, people observe the state power.  Maybe, Its meaning isn't protect our security that this bill was concluded. The ruling party seems to want to return to past. We have to understand importance of got freedom. The Japanese ruling party is becoming more conservative. I want to say them that we never make a war. Anyway, it should not have to decide important such laws in a hurry.  I do not strongly afraid and think that our lives are infringed by approving the secrecy bill. I have never lived, being conscious of right to know or press freedom. If we know that for example information about nuclear power plants, what we can do concretely?Considering the present international relation of Japan, we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. So I basically agree with the bill. However, I cannot admire the Japanese government because the ruling party was so hurry to make the bill that bill's definition is so vague and broad. Regarding this point, we should think carefully, spending much more times. It was by no means praiseworthy.  I agree with ID13016 thinking. I am also afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. In order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution, we must understand this new bill. It is not true that there are only good things about it.  I was surprised, seeing this report. It is because the government has put pressure on mass media in Japan in which I live. It will become impossible for me to trust the Japanese government. The government thinks that it must not make information secret. It is because Japan has kept our lives.  I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms. Press freedom and freedom of thought are very important for democracy.  Making a state secret bill is good for Japanese Government and other countries. Maybe it was strange that Japan didn't have such law as a member of developed countries. However, important informations should be released to the people, because they have the right to know. I think everything shouldn't known by the people, but the information which should be known as Japanese people should be released.  I don't think that the state secrecy bill should've been approved. As people in the passage say, it probably takes the teeth out of democracy. People will be less interested in knowing about politics and complain about it. Although I can understand what Abe is explaining, what I do not understand is the the merit of making the bill for us. Is there no benefit for us? If so, I would like Mr. Abe to explain how important it is for Japanese society and how he is going to make up for the opportunities that citizens would have had if it had not been approved. It should not be good to give final approval to it without much explanation to people.  I was surprised at this news. The state secrecy bill was presented on November 26th and that was passed on December 6th. I cannot be understood how the society will change, but I willing to think about that.  I don't agree with this bill. Of course, Japan have to strengthen more not only national security but also global one. In that point, the bill is effective. However, the bill has other element that we don't know government's decision-making process. The bill also has bad points to Japanese people because Japanese people have the right to know. I think that this bill of the disadvantage is greater than the benefit. I want Prime Minister Abe to make a new law in order to strengthen both national and global security without undermining Japan's democracy.  I haven't understand this bill. What will become crime? Many people are making noise against this bill. I can't understand this too. I think we had got few ""secret"" up to now, so I think we don't have to make a fuss right now. Of cause we will have to stop prime minister when he try to get too much power.  I was very angry when I read this news because the secret law is terrible. Under the this law, people couldn't research about the particular secret, and this secret is decided by the government. So the government can control about the nation's opinion. I can't believe the government because they hide a lot of important information which the nation should know. I never want to be controlled like this government.  I think that the contents of state secret law is not bad. Japanese government had no effective law to crack down on spies. It is a very serious problem for our country. So we need this law. However, the way to approve is bad. It is natural that some people fear that they cannot protest against the government. The government have to relieve their mind. However, I think Japanese government did not do it at all.  I am somewhat worried to this state secret low. I have a question not to the contents of this bill but to how to determine. The government approved this bill forcibly. I think that the time of talks was more nearly required. Since having been decided is unavoidable, this bill is wanted to be used correctly.  I'm against this bill. I have two reasons for this. First, I'm afraid that this bill will threaten the freedom of speech and press. Second, this bill makes it difficult for people to check government decision. If we can't know the information about the government, we can't check anything. With these reasons, I'm against this bill.  I'm against the new state secrecy bill. The government said that the purpose was to strengthen Japan's role in global security and create a more authoritarian government at home, but I couldn't fully understand the advantage of it. Far from that, I thought there were more risks as Kyouji Yanagisawa said. I also couldn't understand why the bill was passed though many Japanese and foreign journalists, writers, academics and activists had all opposed the bill. Wasn't it the democratic government? This news story gave me a question about a recent political system.  I agree with the secret law. I think Japan needs the secret law today. Because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. We should to protect the important information.  When I read this article, I am afraid of our peace of ordinary lives. This new law punishes the people who talking or leaking the secret of Japan national security. And it means that the state watch us. I can't imagine how watch the state us. It is so scary thing. The state should protect itself from the outside. But this new law is really necessary for us? I can't think so.  I think some media threaten us too much. By secret law, I think, our lives will not be damaged. However, we should check the law because government may use law inappropriately. To defense and save the important information, this law is necessary, but government should not concern information which should be open to us.  I feel dizzy. Democracy is important, of course. we need liberty, too. However, we have to protect ourselves from spies abroad and something like this, so we will lose something important which we achieved thanks to many sacrifices. I think that everyone actually knows what is right or wrong, and what we should do, but they're never free from human greed, and some act things just for themselves. However, we should always try to move in a right direction despite any enemies standing in front of us.  A state secrecy bill cast question that what is our freedom to us. Honesty I can't say a state secrecy bill is absolutely bad. In fact, that law can be able a state to hide contents or incidents that is not good for them. That action trespass on people's freedom, that is human right. While that danger, that law may be useful to stay nation in safe. So I think safe system is needed for preventing authorities from abusing.  I wondered that Japan did not have this state secret law until now, because most countries have laws like this. There was more concern that this law is established as there is a voice of protest and demonstration, but the purpose of this law is to strengthen the protection of Japans's secret weak compared to foreign countries. So, I think criticism such that there is a risk toward the war to establish this law. Simply because it is a difficult problem with safety assurance, it is a problem that we must discuss also established later.  State secret law is difficult to interpret. Not only the people, but also politician don't understand the details of this law. However, I think it is not god to criticize the idea of this law. The problem is the vagueness of the text. I afraid to use this law subjectively by malevolent man.  I don't agree with your thinking. The government say the fabrication in many times. However, it is sometimes necessary to protect nation. If the politicians must say only the truth, the trust of government is broken immediately. I think it is important for us to monitor arbitrary action of the government and to understand the idea of this law.  I don't know which side should be taken. we need this law because our country have secrets. And it is not good for other countries to know this secrets. But, at the same time, this law can be very dangerous.  I support the state secrecy bill. Japan did not have spy prevention laws, and so Japan allowed spies easily to steal information. This bill can prevent leak of important information related to national defense. Furthermore, this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Although there are those who oppose this bill because this bill, they argue, infringes public right of access information, I think they don't fully understand the contents of this bill. Actually, this bill is not very related to the public. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are classified in four categories; defense, diplomacy, prevention of threats to safety and terrorism. It is meaningless for the public to know information about these categories. Therefore, this bill doesn't infringe our rights and bolster national security.  I agree with you. Japan should protect the secrets to protect our own country. However, it may occur that this law limit more information than necessary. And this leads to violate individual privacy.  I agree with the secret law. When I read this news I think that the claim of the opposition is not logical. This bill was decided for a diplomatic reason. However, the opposition pays attention to only domestic things. Of course diplomacy to be more important than an internal affair. This bill isn't the best, bat this law is better than now one. People should think what is important and what is better action.  I am greatly concerned about this bill. As the article says, this law would allow the government to keep people away from important information by force so that we could not make a political decision. Such a situation is really similar to the one made by Japanese military regime under WWII. Moreover, I was very disappointed because Prime Minister Abe forced to pass the bill very quickly, ignoring all the criticisms and concerns. They should have spent much more time to discuss the bill. I would like Abe administration to listen to the opposite before passing bills by force of numbers.  I was surprised at stating secret law. Because it decided rapidly. I wonder why the government hurried up about it. It was said that the answer was USA's pressure for Japan joining TPP. I think Japan is afraid of America too much. Japan should become a country to have the power and the speaking right. And I concern myself about diet member's concealment increasing by the secret low.  I disagree with you because I think the law is needed Japan today because the threat of the terrorism is growing and we have to protect the important information. Your concern will be eased if the organization that checks whether the information should be hidden or not. Of course its member mustn't be a member of the government.  I agree. The freedom is so important. If this law will press our freedom, it have to be deleted.  I was surprised to hear that news. I can't agree with pass this bill. I think this bill can be dangerous. This bill makes Japanese politicians authoritarian. But, this bill can be efficient law. I think this law can be bad or not depend on how to use. I hope this law is used by politicians for Japan's peace.  This news is difficult to solve. If the State secrecy law is accepted, government can hide a important information and they can change an another fact easy. But further than that problem, every people can get important information is dangerous I think. if we can get a collect information easy, of course all over the world can get it. Now many terrorism are around, if they catch important information, that is really serious problem.  When I heard this news, I felt it is so difficult. This bill has two sides. One side, it protects the country's secrets. It means it protects us for danger from other countries. The other side, the government can hide information. that are inconvenient for them.  I I agree with you. I'm afraid that we lost freedom and peace because of this bill. It is bad we cannot check government decision. I hope politicians use this law to improve Japan.  State Secrecy Bill was approved at the end against a lot of nations' opposition. Personally I think it was a good consequence though the law still has much room for the government's explanation and improvements. Such a big law has not been decided in the Diet these days so they should have courage to 'change'. It is natural that a number of people disagree with an innovational idea. A person or the government that can persuade those people with good faith does have a qualification to rule a country.  Recently a lot of law were made, so I can't understand all law. But today Abe will make new law. If the law is very important, if people break promise, the law has no role. i think law should be made a promise.  I think that the secret low is necessary legislation, however, that the current proposal is not enough. In order to protect the national interest, protection of secret is important, on the one hand, it's right to know what we should also be emphasized. It should be prevent that infringing the rights of our knowledge, and to be abused the law. I believe strongly the need for third-party monitoring committee for this bill. Because I think this bill that we should be improved, I sympathize people opposed. I want the politicians to listen to public opinion all means.  I disagree with your opinion. This law does not infringe our rights to access information. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are related in only national defense. We don't need to know the information that this law restricts. There are nothing what the general public can do for national defense. If we throw away this bill for our rights to access information, we will endanger our country to let spies easily steal important information about national defense.  In my opinion, State secret law should not be approved. I think this low make a bad situation because it means ruling party's secret are forgiven. If there is a lot of rules in the law, it will interpret what they like. So I think this law is bad for Japan's economy That is important point what is ID13016 said. We have a right to know about our country's information. Although, if we can have information at one's fingertips, and anything, that is also dangerous. So I agree with you making ""secret"" clear is necessary.  I also think this is a difficult problem because information cannot be released. Both Japan's policy toward the United State and domestic politic are important. So we should think more about this law problem.  I agree to your opinion. If we lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. This bill threatens today's Japanese democracy system.  I agree with this opinion. I also don't want to my opinion be controlled by government. We should have right to know all information because we are the party of this country.  I can't agree your opinion in all point. In fact, not only Japan but other country need state secret law to certain degree. 21th century is information era. Information is power or force of each country. So information is very important. But it is in terms of a nation. In terms of people, oppressive law as Japan's is not good clearly and not appropriate.  I disagree with your opinion. This law is intended to protect Japan from the foreign country. The concrete content should be decided by addition. This law is better than before one.  The bill could suppress the freedom of speech and publish. It is said that the mass media play a significant role in monitoring the government and providing important information about politics to people. So if this bill will be more strengthened, the mass media will lose its role and we Japanese people will lose our rights to know. According to the survey conducted by Mainichi Shimbun, 59% of Japanese people opposed to the bill. The ruling party must listen to the voice of citizens much more carefully.  I agree with his opinion. It is true that ""there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing. ""They will be bigger enemies than attacking the freedom of the citizens.  I think the law is needed for Japan today. This bill will help not to leak the important information related to national defense. And also this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Of cause I know that this bill has some problems but I think anything is better than none.  I totally agree with your opinion, because this law can limit our freedom. As you say, press freedom and freedom of thought are very important, so we should protect these freedoms by objecting to this law.  In fact, in information age, we have to treat abundant information. It is same to a nation. So important information needs protection. But person's privacy is equal to a nation in terms of importance. In conclusion, the border is needed.  Yeah I think so too. Japan certainly lacks security against foreign threat or terrorism. The opinion which only focuses on the violation of our freedom, bad point of the bill, is not practical. However explanation against the people and agreements from the people are important, should not be ignored.  I don't agree with this idea. To be sure, terrorism is growing, but deliberation time is too short. It is possible that government became terrorist if they don't deliberate more time.  We had no time to judge whether this law is good one or not. This can be lack of democracy.  This sounds like Japan is going back to the war-time.  I think this law can make a good influence to the country too. It is true that the law will limit our freedom. But still there are some good point for the Japanese government and other countries. I even thought it was strange that the Japan didn't have such law as we developed.  Though I admit that your opinion is right for the point of national defense, but I still think this bill will cause more harm than good.  I don't want to see politicians' quarrel like children in the Diet. Surely the way to approve the law was too high-handed but it was also caused by the lack of forces of the opposite parties. They should work hard not to blame the ruling party or government but to win the trust from public people.  I agree with the state secret bill. A lot of people in Japan fear terrorism. If important information leak, possibility of terrorism will get higher. Therefore, I think the state secret bill which protect terrorism should be carried out.  I agree with you. mass media make a great fuss about this law. This law is necessary to protect secret information of military. But they said as if this law were made to information of the government.  I strongly agree with this new law. I don't say the opposition is wrong, but I think they can't think wisely. This new law is not completely good but this is better than older one.  I can't agree with the secret law. This is because I fear it gonna be limits of freedom. This law would be allow the government to keep away from important information, so that we are not able to make a political decision. I think this situation is not good for nation and it will limit the human rights. So that I think Mr. Abe should think about this once again! If this bill is allowed, how can we save our life from nuclear threats?? I think this new bill must be the threat for Japan because I don't think Japan has enough experiment to protest from other country's invading. So I don't agree with this decision.  I disagree with you. Once we he lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. We cannot say what we want to say same as ""Toshokan Senso"" I think so too. People decide the law in very short time. It will make Japan bad. Because the law is not thinking deeply. I think Abe should think more.  I think so, too. This bill is not clear about definition of secret. So, this bill must be passed.  When I know this topic first, to tell the truth, I can't understand the real meaning of this law. I hope this law will work for making good our nation. But hearing the public opinion, new law is as the regulation of our statement. If it is necessary for protecting our country, I don't want Japan to pick us up the right of free to speak.  I agree with you. THis bill should be passes now. In Japan, differing from the US, a public information act is not established. So in Japan, first, a public information act should be established.  I agree with you. Why we had wanted democracy so long time, we are about to break our country's security now? We must think this problem first.  We have the right to all the knowledge what our government do. However, state secret law can take our right. I think it's wrong thing. So I disagree with this law. The government hide some information, I can't trust them.  I agree with your opinion. This bill could be applied illegally because its content is too vague. Everything has both good and bad points. All we need is to understand both sides and to consider what we should do. I believe that the country where people cannot say what they want to say is not a democratic country.  I think so , too. But, on the other hand, I think that to protect secrets and national interest is necessary. So, I want politician to improve this low.  I disagree with her opinion because the new law may have the risk which is that the government control the important information. However, at the same time, I respect her opinion because I can understand her reason. In this way, this is a difficult issue. I don't hope the government will be despotic.  I disagree with your opinion. It is true that this law is necessary to defense country. However this law regulation in very wide range. So, I think we should limit this law strictly  I can't totally agree with you. It includes the danger of vague definition. However, this law could help improve national security as well.  I can't agree your opinion in all point. 21th century is information era. Information is power or force of each country. So information is very important. But it is in terms of a nation. In terms of people, oppressive law as Japan's is not good clearly and not appropriate.  I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation.  Japan should protect the secrets to protect our own country.  I disagree with you. Because I think that this law is not dangerous for Japanese people. But this law is dangerous for Japan. However, the country is consist of people. The profit of people should take first priority. So, country should not lie and have a secret to people.  I disagree with your idea. Because if this law pass, the government can hide some information they don't want to say to citizen. For example, they can hide about Fukushima radiation. This information is related our health. If we could not get this, we cannot do anything. So this law should not be passed.  When I read this news, I think that this law may get rid of rights from us. We have rights. And we are free! And I have the right that I should know about information of the government. So I hope this law will disappear in the future.  I agree with your opinion. If we lose freedom to know, we cannot take freedom back. Of course, the bill is important for peace among foreign countries. It is true that the bill weaken Japan's democracy system.  Your dream attract me. I think so that journalist should tell information to everyone. For it, I oppose to stating the secret law, too.  I agree with you. I also don't want to my opinion be controlled by government. We need to right to know any information. Because we are public of Japan. (I couldn't log in my account. ) I agree last sentence a lot. However, I don't think the bill influence the freedom. The secret information government says is far from our life. Anyway, we should check government.  I agree with you. Before applying the Secet State law, it is needed to define the meaning the word of secret. If not, it would be used by government and there is risk that Japanese people don't know the important decision making process.  I think that it is actually important that sharing national security information with other countries that have power all over the world such as United States. State secret law makes it possible to do that. But, on the other hand, it has a big problem for Japanese. The prime minister can govern more smooth with other countries by this law. But Japanese people can't see inside of the policy and decision making process. Therefore, the policy that has disadvantage for people could be applied more easier than before.  I agree with you. And I think we have the right which know about our country's things.  I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation. However , I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms.  I agree with your opinion. Considering the present international relation of Japan, we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan. But I cannot agree the way the government decide.  I think the discussion about making the new law is insufficient. The argue of the Diet looks like a quarrel of children for my eyes. We need more information and time to think carefully. NHK news says diplomatic problem between America is important issue. And the government has been its nature of secret before. So, the law makes the government more silent institution. I think the final decision mustn't had decided .  I agree with you ID13042. As the proverb says ""The law is harsh, but it is the law"", we Japanese must keep the Japanese law. So we should be more cautious in passing laws.  I don't think that only important information for people is released by approving the state. What is ""important"" anyway? The government will give us information what it wants us to see, not what we want to see. I disagree with the state secrecy bill because the government tends to hide them.  We all have ""rights to know"" equally. If the bill is enforced in the future, it threatens to ""the right to know"". Is the bill against for Japanese constitution? Abe government said it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism. I think it is not true. I can't understand the relation between restricting ""the right to know"" and protecting our country. I afraid Abe government will abuse it to proceed his policy.  I agree with you. The bill is certainly abused in the future. Even if Abe government utilizes it properly, following government may abuse it. I think it is illegal and Abe government should withdraw it immediately.  Indeed state secret law would restrict our freedom of speech. It is very difficult to save the freedom of people without compromising the order. I agree with the law because we should give the part of our freedom to the government in order to keep the order, and this is the role and structure of modern governments.  I agree with you. What you insist on is necessary to protect the people's right and keep the order in the country at the same time. To make the secret clear is an indispensable compromising of the government.  I don't agree with you. Because your opinion is not correct. Why do you know in there are spies and terrorism's threat has been growing in Japan. I guess you believe media's report with no doubt. If this bill will be passed, media's reports which you believe are implicitly and publicly controlled by power more and more and we cannot believe information on the paper and TV more and more.  I think this bill is not good for Japanese people. Because government don't say true information. When 3.11, government's information changed many times. So I can't think that this bill is good for Japan.  I agree with you. I am also opposed to a secret law. I think that the secret law is contrary to the freedom which democracy has. Surely the information which becomes a crisis also has a state. However, I cannot trust the present government. A Diet member will use a secret law and will leave an illegal contribution etc. unsettled. A state and the government have to get trust first. Therefore, the government needs huge efforts.  I agree with you. It is necessary to protect the important information from the other countries. But it also would protect government's secret from us. So I think the lawmakers have to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately.  I don't agree with your opinion. It is true that we should protect the important information from spies, but means to protect shouldn't be this low. I suggest so because I think this low can be danger of freedom of speech. I think saving freedom of speech is really important for us, so I'm against this low.  According to Yomiuri Shinbun, the ""Secret"" isn't about the problems that is very closer to us, for example, about the nuclear plants but about things that are hard to understand for us, for example, GPS data or pictures taken by satellites. Whether this bill truly aims at the defense of Japan or not, such bill is actually needed. In fact, China has a unit for cyber attack called 61398 troop. We should not be against this bill until the government uses it wrongly.  I agree with you. I'm afraid that we lost freedom and peace because of this bill. It is bad we cannot check government decision. I hope politicians use this law to improve Japan.  I think so too. Government should be more clearly about this bill. This is important thing.  I have same opinion. I can't government's information too. And I afraid this bill will press our freedom .  I think this bill is the need in Japan today. If secret information, such as military is leaked out, national defense and trust of allies can not be obtained. However, I have a little anxiety because the range of the secret is not clear. . .  I totally agree with you. I thought the law is too dangerous for nation to be passed, , , but it was passed. so, we have to keep thinking! Your understanding is wrong. The government's decision making process is all shown through the Diet. The other decision making that is decided in the prime minister's official residence is highly political, so we shouldn't get involved.  I think this decision completely harms Japan's democracy. We have the right to speak freely. This is ensured in the Japanese constitution. I don't think the regulation of freedom of speech will start soon, but it is very bad to leave the possibility of it.  I think this law will be effective to win the confidence of other countries if monitoring organization functions. Top secrets like this article says should be kept in order to prevent people from exposing themselves to danger. However, this law can use conceal corruption and leaker can be punished unreasonably for self-interest of politicians. Thus, Japanese government must set third party up in order to make precise criterion of this law's application and to punish leakers reasonably.  The establishment of state secret law is a negative outcome of one-party dictatorship. Japanese citizen often say that speedy making decisions is important for all. Nevertheless, we should have discussed this law more and more carefully before the law is adopted. In my opinion, this low is needed. this low makes politicians and bureaucrats pay more attention to management of secret information. However this law doesn't say clearly what is secret. I think we are supreme ruler and that we can decide whether it is secret or even abolish this low. we are now important point of Japanese politics. Thinking about politics and voting in the election are very troublesome things, but we should be aware of our own country's supreme ruler.  I think that this law is needed in order to give an alliance a feeling of trust. However, I fear to infringe on this law like a lot of antagonists because I cannot know what is secret. We have electronic devices to transmit information to people all around the world as soon as we get it. Therefore, there is a likelihood that we will be arrested. I think the government should make an organization that decide what is secret. It should be made up of politicians and bureaucrats who respect the will of people. The government should alleviate our anxiety.  I object to a thought of government (particularly Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) rather than enactment of secret law. In the first place, I think the politician is a existence to help the nation and improve their lives. However, we learned from this time, they are thinking about themselves with precedence and the secret law was approved without explaining it to the nation enough. So, I think it is necessary to consider what the politician should be. "
JOC JOC-14A-01N 8.42 "Captains have the obligation to help their passengers of their ferry and failing to meet their obligation is the thing which is not accepted. So the thing that the captain of South Korean ferry did is not accepted and he deprived the passengers of South Korean ferry of their lives. The captain and the company must apologize to the passengers and his family, and must explain how the accident happens exactly.  This accident is very bad news. Above all, I feel heat that the captain left passengers in the ship and thought that he saved his own bacon. Certainly, many people would want to be saved at the very beginning if they are in his position. But he accountable to have fall into that circumstance which he had failed steering and the vessel sank, so he was supposed to help passengers preferentially even if he become the last person who board the ship. I'd like to have him become acutely conscious of the captain.  This is one of the most terrible accident that I have ever heard. I hope more people will be rescued. We should never repeat such a tragedy.  I think this is an entirely man-made disaster and this disaster happened because of two reasons. First, the captain lacked a sense of responsibility. I watched the news which says a young conductor died because she had tried to help the ship's passengers instead of the captain who had run away from the wreck. Second, emergency measure wasn't prevailed among the ship's conductors. If the conductors had told the passengers not to stay inside but to run away, more lives was saved. Therefore, I think conductors of transportation need to improve their consciousness of responsibility, because they carry human's lives.  Yesterday, I watched the news about this accident and listen to the unbelievable comment which the captain said. He said that he hurt his hips and he was said ""Get out of the vessel! Hurry up!"" , so he just do as he was said. Moreover, he concealed that he is the captain when he was rescued. I can't believe it! After deserting his passengers, he acted as if he knew nothing about it. And people's dissatisfaction about the government is heightening more and more. I think that the government can't deal with this disaster properly, too. They neglect a training of talented people about duties of protection against disaster and safety. They have to strengthen it immediately. Now, the number of the dead reached 150 and 152 are still missing. I hope that a rescue operation is making fast progress.  I was surprised to hear this news. It may be unavoidable to have caused the accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. According to news, the captain said, ""This ship is safer than any ship. "" Such a reason, It is natural that a captain is blamed. I think those who are doing work which protects people's life should become the most careful. I hope such an occurrence never happens.  When I first heard this news, I felt it was similar to ""Titanic. "" As I knew the details about this disaster, it should be blamed that the captain's sense if responsibility was completely lacked and the Sewol itself was converted in strange way. Also there was no consciousness of safety I think.  Recently, I have heard about this sad news many times on TV, and every time I hear about it, it really made me sad. Among this news, there is something that is bothering me. Korean government refuse Japanese government's help. I know that between Japan and Korea, we are facing a difficult politics problem. However, I think we should help each other under such terrible condition, and that leads better relationship. I hope that many people who are still missing will be rescued, and such a tragedy will never happen again! Recently, I often watch the grieving familys who are crying and shouting on the news. Action the captain took is absolutely unpardonable. It goes without saying. I think measures of South Korean government is bad. They refused support of Japan or America. I don't understand why they didn't accept it. There is no time because the most necessary thing now is to rescue the passengers. I fear search become more serious.  I think this is one of the most tragic disaster. Many of victims are not found now. It make me sad. I'm afraid that this deplorable disaster was forgotten by media and people. I pray that any disaster like this never happen again. So I want not to forgot. Moreover, media all over the world should tell people this accident entirely. This is a very very tragic disaster, but this is a man-made disaster which many people concerned indirectly. The best thing we should do is find the source of trouble.  I watched the news that the disaster like this happened in Japan before. Although in that case there were only 28 passengers in the ship, there were no victims. In Japan's case, the captain of the ship let passengers go on board a helicopter and get on a lifeboat on his own lastly. It is the very best and proper way to be a captain. Korea's captains should follow that Japanese captain and try never to cause a tragic disaster like this time's.  This article made me really sad and I think we have to learn something very important from this. First, we should consider the responsibility of captain. It is true that everyone wants to survive, however, I believe that humanity to others is the most important for us. Therefore, the captain's action in this case is not good. Second, we should consider about what ""safety"" is like. I hear that in Korea, the standard of safety is lower than Japan. For example, it is normal that people don't wear seatbelt in their cars. It is acceptable that there are some differences between the countries, but I think we need to learn from another country. In this case, if Korean standard of safety had been higher, this terrible accident might not have happened. Therefore, I think Korean government have to change and look over rules again soon.  At first, I was surprised and even felt angry at the captain's irresponsibility. But now, I think that, in a way, It cannot be helped. Even though he had the duty to rescue all passengers, it may require so much of courage as one cannot gather. Of course, the act that he did is unacceptable. However, it should be taken into consideration that, like many people, he is a man who is weak and afraid of death. Anyway, I can't do nothing but hope that such a disaster will never happen and the captain will be judged and sentenced legally.  South Korean government and the company managing the Sewol must have prevented this accident. If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so serious as it is. This accident has caused widespread panic in South Korea and other countries. Moreover, the company has lost prestige. I think I won't ride ships possessed by this company. All I can do for victims is praying for them and thinking deeply about preventing recurrence of this accident. I feel irritated that I can do almost nothing for victims. Nevertheless, I hope there are survivors in the ship.  If my family or friends met with a accident like this news, I would get angry for a captain and grieve for them. And if I were the grieving families, I could not forgive the captain's action and existence. It is regrettable that the accident occurred. I think of victims and their family and friends, I'm very sorry about it. Although the captain's action was certainly criticized, I think taking place of his condition, he would also been terrified and want to live. I understand his feeling about that, but I would like to tell him, ""you must understand that all passengers had the same feeling of you. They put their life in your hand, and how many people hope do your best for them and be saved. ""All captains of vessels and pilots of airplanes think the news, and should image the worst case. And they must think If worst comes to worst, what they should do or can do. They must not forget a sense of responsibility about having passenger's lifes. I hope such a accident never happen again.  What will you do if a captain of your ferry escaped without telling the situation?Almost all of the people will do nothing under the situation. The captain of South Korean ferry took a mistake which made us sad. His lack of responsibility for saving his passengers aroused my anger. If it was true that he escaped earlier than anyone else, I could not believe this action. It is natural for a captain to saving the lives of people to the last. This accident had us to be anxiety of going by ship. I often use a ship and an airplane when I take a trip. If my family or friends were involved in such a accident, I would get angry for a captain of the ferry. This is two times that big accidents which makes us sad. I wish these accidents which killed many people never happen forever. It is because that a ship and an airplane is surely need to take a trip.  The captain's act is not acceptable. However I can understand his feelings. If I had been in his position, I would have left passengers like him. Putting passenger's lives before his own life is very courageous and difficult, but since he was a captain, he had a responsibility to do that. I learned I can't be a captain from this news.  Firstly , I offer condolences on the victims of the accident. Many people who are as young as me are still missing. I wish they will be discovered. It is unbelievable to me that captain escaped from the ferry. Captains of ships are responsible for them. So they have to lead the passengers to escape. But he raced to get away without a thought for anyone else. I want to ride the ferry which is capsized by reliable person. I hope for captain's sense of responsibility.  I think this is one of most tragic disaster. A lot of people have not rescued yet. when I think about feelings of the bereaved, it feels me hurt and makes me sad. The problem is a captain responsibility and sloppy administration. I think we should be never happen like this accident anymore.  When I got the whole story of this accident, I felt sad and infuriated. This is not just an accident but a tragedy caused by slipshod management system of company operating the ferry. If a junior officer had not taken helm, this accident would not have happened. If the captain of the ferry had evacuated passengers, it would not have brought many deaths. However, Nothing comes out of just criticizing. They should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible.  This news made me sad, since many people including high school students , who are coeval with me, died. Furthermore the most having made me sad is that this accident was a man-made disaster. The captain escaped more foremost than anyone else and alerted people on board no precautions against the ship careening. If crews had promoted more awareness and evacuated the passengers with feeling of responsibility, more people could have last out. Through this accident, we learned many lessons. As one of the lessons, many companies should give their employees training on safety as necessary harder than before. By enforcing safety standards, I hope that accidents by human mistake will have never occurred.  Reading this article, my first impression to the captain of the vessel was very bad. Of course , it is true that every man is always afraid of his death but as the captain, he was responsible for all the passengers. So, to him, it should have been the last thing to leave the vessel. From the bottom of my heart, I hope the captain and his crew will be sentenced strictly.  The captain of the South Korean ferry should not be allowed to practice as a detective. Captains have a duty to save passengers. However, this captain put priority on himself. I think everyone should take pride in and responsibility for theirs work. Also, there is another problem. The problem is the speed of investigation. When it comes to the saving of a life, the speed is the most important. Of course, South Korea is an advanced country, on the other hand, there is no end of troubles. From this point of view, South Korea is condemned. Then, I think Japan not only criticize South Korea but regard South Korea as a country from whose bad example one can learn.  This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  I can't understand why the captain and his crew jumped into a rescue boat and remind his passengers in the ferry. They should have given instruction to his passengers could move to a safer area. The captain have to take a serious view of passengers' life. Also Korean government neglected countermeasures. I think this disaster could keep off if there were proper countermeasures. I hope such disaster never happen in the future.  This news is really sad. 187 people were killed in the accident, and 115 people are still missing. I ached at the sad news. I felt angry about the captain's action. He was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. These are the action that a captain must not do. If he had acted responsibly as a captain, more people might have escaped death. We must not occur an accident like this again. I pray for the safety of missing people.  I felt sad when I read this news. A lot of people passed away and their family got angry so much about the captain who jumped into a rescue boat though there were many passengers in the ship. I also think he was irresponsible. In my opinion, the captain of the ship should not leave it until all the passengers are rescued. If he don't make the promise, we cannot be relieved when we take a ship.  This news made me shocked and sad, because so many high school students who were as young as me were killed by this accident. If only the captain had attempted to rescue them. . . When I attended a class of Korean language few days ago, I ask teacher who is from Korea opinion concerning this accident. She said""This accident is not only excruciating but also too shameful as Korean to refer to anymore. Also, if you feel uncomfortable when you see pictures of screaming bereaved , I want you to understand their pain. "" I think this accident involved the problem about responsibilities of leaders in every organization.  When I read the article, I felt great angry for the captain. That's because he gave up to rescue his passengers and deserted them in order to survive himself alone. Perhaps, hundreds were still in the water at that time, wanting to be rescued. If the captain has had normal character and advised the passengers to evacuate properly, many of innocent lives wouldn't die. In addition, according the article, almost victims are high school students. All of them had hopeful future, but now have grieving families. Therefore, it is no exaggeration that the captain's stupid act deprived students of their infinite potential. Sincerely, I hope such a terrible accident never happens.  When I heard this news, I was so sad. First, many people were killed in this accident. Especially it was the news that was very sad for me that a high school student was in an accident during a school excursion. It is a very disappointing thing that a young person dies. Second, the captain's action made us get angry. It was an action without a sense of responsibility. I think that I want the crew of the ship to compensate for a crime well. This news made us consider many point. I hope that such a thing never happens.  I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. I think he wanted to be alive when the accident happened. If I face it, I would think so. However, he was the captain of the ferry which carried hundreds of people, so he had a responsibility to save their lives, but he neglected it. It is only natural that he is condemned. We should convey such a tragic accident to coming generation in order that we never forget it and it never happen.  I think this accident may be an example of Korean's problems. It's because this accident is caused by persons, for example, the captain of this ferry didn't operate the ferry. In fact, the most problem is Korean's society!! when the ferry was sinking, a student in the ferry called Republic of Korea Coast Guard(RKCG) to help people in the ferry. But, RKCG couldn't distinguish the call from a call from the captain. This example shows Korean's flaw most, that is, Korean government cannot respond to an issue in case of emergency.  I think that the captain should have dealt with this accident as a captain. He should have been responsible for passengers' lives . I regard a lot of criticism as quite natural. This accident took a heavy toll of human lives. If the crew had listened to the voices of conscience, this accident could have been avoided. We need to learn from and act on the lessons of this accident. We have to conduct an investigation in order to know this background. We need to uncover the reason why the crew neglected their duties.  This news made me sad. That many of the hundreds passengers were high school students is deplorable. In addition, I feel great sorrow in that many passengers still have been in the sea. I hope that people still missing will be found and bodies will return to their family. But, above all, I got angry with the captain who had jumped into a rescue boat leaving his passengers in the wreck. If he had given accurate information and instruction to them, more people would have been saved.  I can't help sympathizing with grieving families when I heard this news. I think the captain's crime was too cruel to be forgiven. Also, I found very interesting thing in this article. If this accident happened in Japan, we would criticize not only a captain, but also a company which employs him. It is because we think the company has a responsibility to train employees. I hope more victims would be saved from the ferry.  This news made me think a lot of things, the responsibility for work, the feelings of the bereaved, the importance of our life etc. In terms of the bereaved, of course I can understand the criticism for the captain. But I also think every life is equally important. The captain also had his family and maybe had the reason why he have to live. If the captain had been dead when the accident had occurred, perhaps he would be a hero now, but isn't it just our ideal? If you were the captain at the situation, can you choice the death while you have a lot of important things? I felt it is so difficult to think of the balance between the responsibility for work and life equality.  The problem of this article is responsibility of the captain, but I think that the company's education is more important. It is true that the South Korean ferry captain did an irreparable thing, however, it is also the responsibility of company. Company have to employ people with sense of strong responsibility and educate strictly. The problem of the Malaysian Airlines flight 370 occurred because of management of company wasn't strict. So I think company have to have strong responsibility.  I sympathized with victim's family, and also felt angry to Lee Joon-Seok, his crew and people who loaded too much. I think that if Lee steered ship and cargos were loaded too much, the Sewol didn't sink. So Korean government should check supervision system of ship.  First, When I herd this news, it caused me much pain. I think all of the captains must be responsible for rider's life, but the captain didn't carry out in the responsible manner. This accident may be significant to consider about responsibilities which professional seamen have. Not limited to this, other professionals like sailors and pilots (Malaysian Airlines flight 370 mystery too) have to be conscious of impotence of life.  I was shocked about this news. I cannot understand why captain jumped into the sea without helping passengers still in the ship. Becoming a captain means he has a high position in the ship and also has all responsibilities of the ship and lives of all passengers who use the ship. I think there is more important things than earning money and fame.  I feel sad to hear this news. I think a lot of people can't understand this accident in detail. So I hope Korean government expose information for this news as soon as possible.  I was shocked at this news, for most of the people who were killed in this accident were high school students. The captain of the ferry should have remained there and given directions to passengers. We must understand what is a problem of this accident and try hard not to make such mistakes again.  I think that it is very sad story. If I were a student who take the ship, I would regret choosing the ship, and if I were the bereaved family, I would regret seeing my son or daughter off. This is not just an affair of other people, and all the countries of the world should be care of their countries safety for a nation.  This is one of the most tragic disaster that I have ever heard. It is a very unfortunate accident. There is a strong possibility of the case that I will be involved in such a miserable accident. So I think I must spend meaningful days in order not to have any regrets.  To hear that news, I was very surprised and sad. This is because the captain of that ferry who should have been left in the ferry jumped into a rescue boat early and abandoned many passengers and his crew . If he had remained, a lot of people would have been saved . Now, all I can do is hope that missing people will be saved. Moreover, the captain must explain this accident and do what is good for the bereaved families.  the captain had to have one choice in two choices, to save himself or to save his passengers, in this case. Of course, he has to save his passengers as the captain of this ferry. But if you are the captain then, what do you do? Do you blame him the same again? I guess he imagined the severe life after going back to Korea. But he thought to live as a criminal is better than to die. Not only us but also himself had the pretty sad. I hope to rescue the left passengers as soon as possible.  Nowadays, we see a lot of newses like this. I'm afraid of the fact that the public transportation is not actually safe unless we believe so. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him. The public transportations should take enough care about their safety and we always have to prepare for the accident so that we can react immediately.  At first, I got angry at what this captain did and feel sorry that many passengers are still missing;( However, I realize that I can't know what happened at the moment because I know the details about the accident only by mass media. I suppose we mustn't accept whatever we read in the newspapers and on the Internet without thinking by ourselves.  I am agreement at your opinion. I also feel anger for the persons involved in this incident. However, when there were few cargoes, didn't the incident occur? It may also be a fact that surely there are many cargoes and operation of a ship has become inconvenient. But, I think that the first problem is a captain's action. So, I think that the incident had occurred even if there were few cargoes.  I think so. Those who have a responsibility has to consider others. The captain didn't think about the passengers. They believe the crews, but they betray them. I forgive what they did.  I think so too. The captain must be subject to punishment. And I think the impact of mass media is large. I pray they rest in peace.  I have a same feeling about this news. I also want a matter due to the luck of captain's responsibility does not happened again. I think the captain of his passengers should save their lives. Otherwise, we will not use public transportation from now. Therefore, I want people not to forget a matter like this.  I completely agree to your opinion. Actually, I thought that the news was similar to the Titanic, but the difference between them is ""season"" the accident occurred. In Korean case, if the passengers had jumped into the sea, they would be alive. The captain should have more responsibility all the more because people who can be rescued died.  I think it's exactly as you say. The captain and crews of Sewol, Republic of Korea Coast Guard and the Korean Government was irresponsible and very loose. So the more they had sense of responsibility, the less people died of the Sewol tragedy, I think. And I think too that Korea should retrain the responsibility and consciousness of government employees and the crews.  I think that I cannot necessarily blame only a captain. It is a very difficult thing to make a calm decision at the point of death. However, I cannot forgive a captain. It is the problem that is not easy to treat.  I always watch TV that The president of South Korea pursuits the issue. But is it top priority for her?I don't think so. She should put stress the right of life of people. Why did she send the limited number of a rescue party?She thinks lightly of lives. Japanese navy and Air Force can have gone to save many people. Because Japanese Forces is in Sasebo near Korea. And she should have asked Japan to do so. Maybe her pride prevents from asking.  I think so. A captain of ferry has a task which is saving passengers' lives. If an accident happens, he must do this and prioritize saving passengers. He who jumped into a rescue boat without saving is far from being a captain. I find that I am not cut out to be a captain, too.  I agree with you. But, it is also dangerous to try diving in the ocean before a ship capsizing. There are as many dangerous things in the ocean as in a sinking ship. So, all we can do to prevent such cruel accident from occurring again is to improve all drivers security awareness and ethics.  I felt the same thing. The worst was captain who didn't evacuate passengers. But only blaming him is good for nothing anymore. I guess they should review their safe control.  I agree with Your comment. -- ""If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill, this accident was not so It approves of the opinion serious as it is. "" I think that the crew lacked the simulation and knowledge of the troubleshooting. The captain said later, ""It was considered When the accident, I could not think anything excepting how to I will be able to live. "" It is because the captain was not able to assume such a miserable accident. Probably, his head has filled then. Nobody should not forget that there is a danger of the accident. For that purpose, a detailed text book and training of fire drill are required.  I was surprised to hear this news. This accident is one of the most terrible accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. I think that captain should have responsibility to the passenger's lives and the government should impose a severe punishment on the captain.  When I read this article, the ferry's captain is cruel man because he acted as murder. captain should be bold and kind, but he is a chicken. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him.  When I read this article, I was so sad and hope that the ferry's captain change himself. He must be punished and we should do many many things by the such thing happen next time. For example, we should restrict captain's license.  I strongly agree with you. You said that they should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible. It is true that we should not forget this tragedy. However, all we have to do is make a new crisis management system in order not to occur such a tragedy repeatedly. They need a personnel cut. To do so, workers who was responsible for this accident should be punished and fired. Furthermore, we make them change an atmosphere in this company.  I think so. Of course I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers. He should have helped hundreds of people instead of himself.  This is true that the captain responsible to this accident. But a people should think seriously why this accident happened.  When I read this news , I felt so sad because many people were killed by this tragedy . Also , I got angry with the captain of this ferry . It is crazy thing to escape from the ferry when the accident happened .  This is very sad news. Certainly, the captain is to be held responsible by the bereaved family. But, I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  Don't you want get on the ferry of the captain who has no responsibility for our lives? If we were passengers of the ferry, we would choose to save our own lives. However, the action of a captain is most important problem in the accident. Therefore, if we were the captains of the ferry, what we would do? If I were the captain, I would choose to save passenger's life first.  I was very shocked to hear this news. I knew an irresponsible person like him for the first time. I am very regrettable that many men and women of the age that is about the same as me died because of him. I think that person in charge must have a serious sense of responsibility by all means. And we must not forget this affair.  When I knew this news, I am high school student. Many Korean high school students were died by this accident. So I am shocked. I think captain should have helped to passenger. But he was escaped from Sewol. I was disappointed of it. "
JOC JOC-14A-11N 8.75 "I think it is impossible to establish privacy laws and regulations which benefit all of us. everybody has made mistakes. In addition, every one has bad memories and want others not to find the matters. Of course it is important to reconsider past faults. We should reconsider past faults in order not to fail again. However, there is a difference between individual reflection on our own faults and open them to the public. If there are articles about somebody's fault on the website, the person has a possibility that he has been ridiculed and insulted even after the person died.  Although this is an important problem which is opposed to freedom of the press, what should be considered in the first place is public interest. At first, it was Google which seethed with anger at the ruling. But after all ""the right forgotten"" was accepted and Google started making to clear of data. However, it is doubtful which rights -- the freedom of a report or the right to be forgotten-- excel. Don't burden only search engine with responsibility. The most important thing is whether they bring people's benefit or not.  The right to be forgotten seems to be more important than the right to know. It is true that private information on the internet is just noise for many people. However someone might be interested in the information, and spread it. It's the matter. We have to pay attention to our privacy because it's unexpectable that what happens on the internet.  The development of the Internet does life very usefully, but thinks that we must not forget that such a problem may come out either. The problem of the privacy is very difficult and is not the thing which can be easily solved. It is important to ""the forgotten right"" finished in a topic this time, but thinks that it is difficult to make a standard. But I think that it was a chance that it is thought by having got nervous in a topic like this time. In this way, I think that it is very important that I guarantee the right that is necessary or important for people.  I found this kind of matter very difficult because it is hard to make ruling to balance between privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we are able to use the Internet whenever or wherever we like, and this made our daily lives convenient. At the same time, however, we see a threat to several problems. We often hear that there are a lot of Internet risks such as computer viruses or addictive games. The news of hacking of the Internet Explorer stolen bank, credit card details became well-known. In this news, debt was information which Gonzalez wanted to forget so I think it is true that he seethed with anger at search engines. However, all of us have to understand that many people all over the world can see the website and be more sensitive about ""privacy"" as users.  The Internet system is essential for the people when we do something in the present lives. Certainly, I often use the Internet in the study. I am not damaged the Internet problems. However, I cannot predict when I am damaged. It is difficult problem because it is ambiguous how far we are able to publish individual informations. When I read this article, I try to pay attention to being involved such a problem.  We could not live everyday life without the Internet. The Internet is very useful to communicate with a lot of people all around the world. At the same time, it is accompanied by danger. Our privacy may be invaded. We are given the freedom of expression that support democracy. However, I think the government should make a ruling that protect privacy. On the other hand, i am worried the day may come when people will be controlled by technology and lose their individuality.  It is difficult to make up a well-balanced idea between personal privacy and public right of access to information. The Internet is useful for many people. And the search engine is also useful for us. If the system is abolished , many people loss the convenient system. Who will get benefit on the case. I agree the article said that the winner is a criminal and convicted person. Because their worse information are erased . That is good news for them. But all information are erased, if people want, people rob the right and ways to know a lot of information. So When the information is erased, we discuss and consider whether the information is important for public and people. If that is Important information for public and people, that is left on the Internet . Although the way to erase take many times, the problem is so important for ours life and right that we should take as much time as we are satisfied. And we should hold the balance between privacy and the right to know .  Whenever it comes to individual privacy data , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted. It is true that you can find much information through the internet easily and instantly. But this also means that people who want to disturb you can access to information about you. at this time, your privacy data would not be erased once it flowed out on the internet. In other words, your privacy data continues to live permanently. It is too dangerous to use the internet. Thus , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted.  As the Internet has developed, there are also developing many problem with it. We have access to huge information, and whatever the information is they will never be deleted without we doing so. In other words, the information updated to the Internet is never lost naturally. We can't help saying that now is the time that people do never forget the something on the Internet. Also, we have to consider the way to protect personal right.  In modern times, Internet influence a lot all of the world. The right of privacy also is suffered from the many information of people. However, Internet system is very useful in our life, so we can't stop using it. Most important thing when we use it is see through the correct information. If we can do it, It help us know , watch and hear various data. I want to pay attention to incorrect information.  I think that this kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. These days, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. At the same time, however, we have a possibility of some risks of Internet. For example, computer viruses, addictive games or hacking of the Internet and so on. We should consider the right way of using Internet.  This is very important problem for us, particularly the young. Today, everyone who has a computer or cellphone can use Internet, and it is very convenient for us to search something. Internet give people convenient environment. However, Internet has also dangerous side. In this article, it said individual privacy is faced danger. These days a lot of people use SNS, for example Facebook and twitter. Those SNS are very interesting for us, but we have to take care how to use, or we may faced problem as in this article. So, I think what we can do now is to use Internet and SNS carefully.  The Internet is very convenient, but is really dangerous. People may be unconscious, but, for example, it leads to a leak of the personal information even to put one's photograph of the face on the profile image of SNS. Besides people of the world can see the public records - even if it is convenient or inconvenient for oneself. If records that the contents are not good for the person are left semipermanently, affecting that is bad in the later life of the person may be inevitable. Therefore I think that ""right to be forgotten"" is necessary.  Today we can get any information from the internet, and communicate with people all around the world any time. It is so convenient. But it also mean we have possibility of getting many risks like viruses, bad informations having bad influences and privacy problems etc. . We don't know when and how damaged such a problems. So it is important that we are putting our lives at risk every time whenever we are using internet.  Privacy is an important right for people. Freedom of the press and the right to know might be a thing can be in conflict with privacy. However, once such information is spread to people, it is not possible to erase it. I think that there is a great obligation for a company with a large social impact, such as Google to the protection of privacy. , I want you to be so. I thought it was because it is society that many people use the Internet, we also must become more sensitive.  Your opinion is interesting. Indeed, the majority of people have no interest in the privacy of others. However, there are people who are not a little interested. I felt it's privacy in order to guard against such people.  Nowadays, we cannot think of the world without Internet. We can search various information like personal history from Internet. However, when we do so, we always face the problem. If we support one's privacy and people can just erase whatever they want, it means others miss the opportunities to know about them. And if we support the idea that people have the right to know and people can't delete the information they want others not to know on Internet, the person may miss the chance to start over. As I mentioned above, this problem isn't easy to be solved, but we should always consider what is the best approach to it.  I personally think that right to know is more important than the right to be forgotten. When we are trying to find employment, the companies won't be able to know what kind if person we are without the right to know. We should rethink the importance of the right to know.  Today, there are so many information on the Internet and we have probability that we leak our personal informations. However, we can't live without Internet anymore. It is energetic in various aspect of our lives. It is important to repress leaking our personal informations ourselves, before make law or regulation which protect our privacy.  These days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet. There are a lot of useful information, but we don't know whether it is true or not. It is said that especially Japanese people have less media literacy than those of other countries in the world. We should have critical judgment when we use the Internet. Also, we should be more careful when we provide the Internet with information, especially that of privacy.  This is very difficult problem. Today, information spread over the world through Internet in an instant. So we must be careful to send our own information. We may have a trouble. If we can remove the links, it is helpful. However, we have freedom of speech. Some people can overuse the right to be forgot. I want to pay attention to this topic in the future I think the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know. Because of the development of the Internet, it becomes easy to search a lot of information. However it means that everyone can find someone's privacy data, so it can cause a trouble. If I write careless comments on the Internet, I will involve with trouble. Therefore I think the right to be forgotten is important.  This kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. As the Internet has developed, our life is more convenient. However we also have possibility of getting many risks. So we have to reconsider the use of Internet.  Today, we can have enormous information thorough Internet. It is so convenient and it make our life affluent. However, various problems arise naturally over information. For instance, the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for us. However, in the fact, balancing the two perfectly is impossible. Information on Internet is sometimes makes us happy, also sometimes hurt us. I think it is important that we judge what is useful, safe correct information. We must not depend on Internet, must get along with it.  I don't forget the day when Prime Minister Abe rammed the ""right to know. "" It is because his act which shakes democracy deserves blame. The problems of privacy surround our every day. We could not go out outside, if a line called privacy is not drawn. But, this ""right to know"" is not a right for someone to try to get to know us. this is the right we know about what the government is performing. As for me, having been deprived of the right is very sad. I may also forget this some day. But, I thought that I will continue studying since i don't forget it.  There are two rights, ""right to know"" and ""right to be forgotten"" in this news. If we don't have the former, we won't be able to watch mass medias and officials as citizen. And I think it also embodies human's reflection about war. So we must not lose it. On the other hand, if we don't have the latter, we'll be burdened with our gloomy past. And I think those who has brilliant past are also burdened. So we must not lose both of them. But they cannot live together. Right should be used correctly, I think. Before we insist on our right, we need to confirm whether we understand how to use right or not.  To be sure , we have rights to know. However , we should keep others privacy because no one want to be known everything about myself .  I think that right to know is very important, so the government and media should reveal informations as possible as they can. Certainly, it is important that any information circulate because the information might be harmful for anyone. However, people had better know many informations that will not have a risk for society and people's living. Search engines and government should choose good informations to opening to the public.  I think this kind of issue is very difficult. It is because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. I think we should do now is to use Internet carefully.  I cannot say my opinion about this problem clearly because this problem is beyond me! I do not want to let strangers look into my privacy data or to lose the freedom of expression. The former is personal threat and the latter is national threat. If anything, the latter is more terrible, in my opinion. It is difficult to balance protecting privacy with freedom expression. But as this article says that search engines are the tools that allow users to make sense of the vast quantity of information on the Internet and find what they are looking for, I think this problem is good in that it made us meditate what privacy is like and what freedom expression is like . This problem is up to us, so we should be more interested in this and understand them.  I think we should draw the line between the extent of opening our privacy. I don't want to share my privacy information to my stranger on the Internet, on the other hand, I want to share my information to my friends. The companies of social networking must respect their consumer's criterion. Thus, I think privacy must have priority over the right of expression on the Internet.  I thought that the right to forget is good idea because If I found my personal information or my embarrassing photos on the Internet, I would be unpleasant. With the right to forget, I can erase them quickly and can avoid more troubles. In this information-oriented society, the right to forget will be more and more needed.  Today, the Internet is so essential for us that we can't live our daily life without it. And the progress of the Internet is striking and remarkable. However, we are facing a lot of serious issues as the Internet system was progressed. The biggest issue is a ""privacy"" issue, which are mentioned in the article. It is said that ""A wonder lasts nine days"", but once an article was updated to the Internet, we can't delete it perfectly and it would not disappear permanently. That's because the Internet connects us all over the world and if we use search engine like google or Yahoo!, we can find almost all information from a huge data bank. There's no escape. Therefore, in order to protect ""the right to be forgotten"", we (or governments) should do something before it is too late.  I think it is difficult to solve this problem because if we regard the privacy as important, we may slight the freedom of expression and if we regard the freedom of expression, we may slight the privacy. That's why we have to consider the balance between the privacy and the freedom of expression when we argue this problem. Nowadays we couldn't live our daily lives without the Internet , so this problem is very important for everyone. In addition, there are a lot of crime and fraud on the Internet. I suppose we have to consider more seriously about this problem and think how we should use the Internet over more once.  This article's point is surely plausible. But I am afraid that advocating ""the right to know"" more than ""the right to be forgotten"" ends up harming the human dignity. It might be an important theory to keep information about people who committed a crime in the past to enhance social collective awareness. But in practice, a great deal of information that exists on the Internet is not always about criminals. That is, there is a lot of personal information about ordinary and innocent people, a part of which might be used by someone for crime. Does our society really need information about such people? In other words, does it make our awareness about ""social security"" higher?I think it does not. It is almost impossible to deny ""the right to be forgotten"", when you think about people whose personal information happened to be online. Of course, we can't live a day without information technology like the Internet. But even so, a clear protection for privacy is necessary.  I agree with your opinion. I think it is difficult for them to keep the balance between personal privacy and public right access to information. The Internet is used all over the world, and much information spreads. Therefore management of the information is difficult, and it is a fact to have the possibility that the personal information leaks out. I am the same as the opinion of this person and think that it is necessary to argue to find a better method to keep the balance.  The present age is risk society. In global Internet society, leaked information can't stop diffusing. We should use the Internet from an understanding of that. Certainly, "" the right to be forgotten"" is usability. But, I believe freedom of expression should be absolute in democratic government. By reason of that, first, we understand the risk involved with Internet society. It is the most rational attitude, I think.  I agree with you. It may make more sense for someone to understand the Internet's risk. ""Right to be forgotten"" is of limited effectiveness for privacy. We should avoid excessive expectations. It is rational way of thinking.  I think ""the right to know ""should be more respected than ""the right to be forgotten"". To begin with, the major role of mass media such as, TV newspaper internet site etc, is surveillance of the authority . If ""the right to be forgotten""were so esteemed, the role of mass media as the observation would be feeble. If it were not for the surveillance, politicians would behave at their own sweet will. To begin with, in democratic society, the person who create the country is the citizen. To create a country, they need a tremendous amounts of information. For , without information, they don't know what to do. So to create sound democratic society, we should value ""the right to know"".  When I read the article ""Google agrees to forget"", I commented that I think privacy should be respected and individuals should be able to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. Of course, I still think protecting individuals' privacy is important. However, I realized that if it was admitted legally to erase information on the Internet, individuals, companies and so on may erase their past indiscretions and conceal something wrong for them. I don't think it isn't good that the weak of information increasingly come not to be able to access to important information.  The world has been small recently and the Internet has been used all around the world. We can get every kind of information easily, for example social, political, cultural and of course personal. Thinking of this situation, it is needless to say that there is danger. In order to avoid risk, some action is taken, I hope.  I think that there are always conflicts between opponents and defendants as long as laws are to defend one's right . For example, if laws would be set up to defend ""Hate Speech"", it faces the problem that it might be against the right to free of expression. Like this conflict, this problem have similar conflict. If laws would be made to regulate the right to forget, it would be against people's right to know. Thus it is only natural that when some has advantage the other has disadvantage. We should consider both sides as much as possible.  I disagree with this opinion. In this opinion, we should protect our personal right even if we cannot have the right to know. So when we think only about the personal right, we are to neglect the right to know everything that we wanna know. When we judge the matter about politics, politicians and economy, a lot of information need.  In the present age, we became able to change much information by the Internet in a shorter time. It is what you should be pleased with very much and thinks that it is that life becomes rich that the world becomes convenient. However, I include much risk. The damage by the Internet increases. I feel that we should use the Internet after having understood it enough. More world may become convenient, but attention is more necessary from now on.  I think the right to be forgotten is necessary to some extent because our shameful information on the Internet may exert a harmful influence on our career or daily lives. However as this article says, we have to reconsider the way to protect people. Overprotection of the privacy may lead the restriction on our right to know . Government of each country should play a key role in a work to reconsider who is really in trouble and what help they really need and balance our 2 rights, right to know and right to be forgotten.  I agree with you. In fact, we cannot do anything without using the Internet. An advance of the Internet helps us to live in comfortable, but it will be possible to cause troubles such as an infringement of privacy. I think privacy is more important than the right to know. However, this problem is difficult, so we have to think about it prudently.  Your opinion is interesting. I can understand what you think. The right to know is required, when we search something in detail. However, I think in terms of danger of the Internet, we must protect own privacy, so the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know.  I think the right to be forgotten is necessary for us, because we have to protect our privacy information by ourselves. The Internet is very useful and we can search everything we want to know. So, there is a danger that someone gets our privacy information through the Internet. Therefore, we need the right to be forgotten to protect us from the danger.  I think ""right to be forgotten"" is needed in this information society. This is because it is easy to make our some information reveal on internet. However if the law which admits ""right to be forgotten"" is made , we will have two problems. One is that we cannot learn from our mistakes because our fault can be erased and we can forget something bad. The other is that we cannot use certain public information to set insurance rate. There will be no evidence which guarantees us. So eventually, we have to manage our information by ourselves until the law which makes us protect is made.  I think these kind of punishments is needed. My teacher in elementary school was arrested a couple years ago and you can still search for him on the Internet. There is no privacy on the Internet. This is the serious problem but controlling information is close to surprising the freedom of speech. Therefore we have to control our information by ourselves.  The Internet has both good aspects and bad aspects. One of good aspects is we can find out what we want to know speedily. On the other hand, bad aspects are, for example, that we are put at risk that we may be known our private data unwillingly. I think the latter aspects are more important because they are sometimes related to our life. We can stoke somebody by using the Internet. To protect people, I think it is necessary to emphasize more on right to be forgotten than on right to know.  I think this problem can not be concluded simply. Because in private information, right to be forgotten should be admitted. While, public one should not be erased. However, distinguishing private information clear from public one is very difficult, so blanketing right to be forgotten is difficult in realistic decision. All we have to do is being careful when we write in Internet site.  Internet is essential for modern people. Internet is the base of our life and has the influence for the world. I think that perfect protection of privacy is impossible thing by the existence of internet at present. The important thing is how not to our information to the internet. You had better give up deleting our information thoroughly.  I think it is very difficult problem to resolve because we want both freedom of expression and privacy. However, to keep this balance is very difficult, so I think we should make some efforts to protect us by ourselves partly. For example, we should understand literacy of the Internet surely before we use the Internet. If needed, it is nice idea that schools teach their students it because the Internet must be the main tool for us to get the information in the future. We shouldn't think it is natural that our rights are protected.  I think privacy problems cannot be solved. It is because privacy problems is relevant to the right to know. If privacy is protected, the right to know is not protected and if the right to know is protected, privacy is not protected. In order to solve this problems, we should define that how much privacy should be protected and the right to know should be protected.  I disagree with your comment because I think we shouldn't leave the responsibility completely to the government. Maybe we cannot avoid the world where people use the Internet to get the information in the future. So we shouldn't think it is terrible but should think how we can use it well. For that, each of us should understand the literacy of the Internet surely and protect us by ourselves as well as the government do for us.  I disagree with your opinion. I think we cannot compare right to know with privacy.  It is very difficult to define a difference between privacy and freedom. So we must think this problem more severely. I know the man was blamed on Internet , and this comment has been remaining.  As I wrote before, I think Americans do not understand what freedom of speech is and how it works. Freedom of speech is one of the way of exercise the right of resistance under natural law. And we make use of it, when the government oppress our fundamental rights, life liberty and poverty. But in this case, whose natural rights or constitutional rights are violated by the government? there is no violation. But the right of privacy is the matter of the relationship between individuals, not between subject or people and government. So in this case the privacy must be the top priority.  I agree to your opinion. I was never involved such a internet problem too. But internet is very important for us. So we need to understand how to use it correctly and pay attention not to being involved such a problem.  The internet is certainly convenient, but it is very dangerous. I think privacy is important. Although there is an aspect that privacy invade free speech, we should protect privacy in order to guard individual information.  Privacy and right to know are very important for us. So this problem is difficult to solve. In my opinion, right to be forgotten is needed because privacy is related to trust. "
JOC JOC-14B-09N 8.63 "When I was high school student, I was taught what AED is like and how to use it. However, I think many people have never used it in this kind of real traffic accidents and maybe it is not clear if we can behave quickly and use it properly. In an emergency situation, I think most of us will be upset and cannot behave bravely, but after reading this article, we should do that to help people's lives! In this news, ""chikan"" made it difficult problem when a man was about to cut through the woman's clothes. It is very serious problem, however, in my opinion, we should not care about that because I think it's much more important to save the injured and we must hurry!!! Therefore, it's true that I can understand what the driver of the vehicle said but I agree with the man who saved the woman. This case would have happy end but anyway, I think the government should improve the training about using AED at schools.  I think AED should say that even people who may not have been received training can use. Almost all people will be unwilling at first, but in the emergency situation people around patient needs speedy action to rescue him or her , so we have no time confused. Therefore we need understand AED can be used by anyone, and we can't waste even a minute.  I just feel sorry for the man who saved the woman's life despite all the troubles. And this news makes me think that we should learn more about how to use AED. Ignorance can make a serious problem. In this case there were no victims, but the woman might have been killed by the driver's inappropriate ""sense of justice"" if he prevented the man from using AED earlier and more forcibly. Most of us are taught how to activate AED, yet do not know how to use it properly. So, from now on, more concrete training should be given to citizens so that we can deal with the difficult situation as in this story.  This news promotes negative behavior. It's really too bad. I want to praise his efforts. We should get knowledge of the correct use of AED. And, we must know to use an AED as soon as a sudden cardiac arrest happens. I hope everyone act without hesitation.  I have heard the news and been sympathized with the man who try to save the women. The fact that there is a person who don't know how to use AED and call the police officer is very surprising. I was taught the way of AED in schools and driving schools. Unhappily, such things may make other people be unwilling to use AED. AED is effective. We must not make atmosphere that you cannot use without hesitation. Today, people are too sensitive. We should become more generous.  when I read this article, I was shocked. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police. This is very poor thing. Definitely if I was driver, I would think like this too. But this mean I don't know correct use of AED. We must know how to use AED correctly and help each other.  I felt sad when I read this article. This is because there are some cases where kind intentions bring about unfortunate results. I think it is not good that the driver did not trust the man's kind behavior. Eventually this incident does not have bad result because the driver has understood that his idea had been just a misunderstanding and this case would make us not hesitate over whether we can use AED for women in emergency or not.  I think it is very foolish act. The driver should realize what the man did is correct by the accident situation and trust the man's kind behavior. these days, there are AED in many places. AED automatically explain how to it by themselves for someone who have not known how to use it. But as I learned how to use and what AED is in high school health education class, people should know the basics of AED using. We can not know when we encounter such a life saving situation.  I agree with you. I also think his action is really courageous and admirable. It is good for this country to increase a kind man like him, so we have to understand how to use AED and we are prepared for this situation.  I think that we can realize what the man do for the injured woman is correct by the situation of the accident. Anyway, I agree that your opinion that we must know how to use AED correctly. It is because we don't know when we encounter such a life saving situation.  I think the number of people who have right knowledge is too small. I think we must now the way for using AED in order to save human's life. We will be able to criticize the person who act rightly like him because of lack of knowledge.  I was very surprised after read this article. I think when we compare to rescue a person with fear to be called ""Hentai"" or ""Chikan, "" I will choose rescue. I can't understand why people who is an acquaintance with person who was rescued say such a terrible thing. They should rather say ""Thank you!"" I believe it is normal to choose rescuing person who is injured. So, I have no idea why they didn't choose it.  In our daily life, it is often occurs to jump to wrong conclusions. But we should not hesitate to take brave action to save a human life. As this article says, saving life is more vital than feeling shame at blaming as Hentai or chikan. Unfortunately the man was mistaken for pervert when he was trying saving a woman's life. we should take bold actions when it is needed.  Students of this generation receive the training of AED, therefore we all know that we have to remove any clothing when applying AED. It is shocking to me that people who don't know the appropriate use of the AED takes the action in the wrong way and even report it to the police. If the lady was in more serious condition, she would have been dead. One reason why the driver mistook his action is that he didn't know how to use the AED, and another is that a lot of pervert occur in Japan. Because perverts are not now unusual, people would think it's a pervert if a man was taking a woman's clothes off. It is a shame as a Japanese to even think someone would do such thing at a scene of car accident. I hope more people know about AED and people would trust others.  I agree with you. However, Ido not think that a lot of people can do such brave things. Nobody want to take responsibility if people who he or she aided dies. We have to do a drastic reform about lifesaving.  I have learned how to use AED at the driving school, but I don't have any confidence in using AED correctly. I think everyone should learn how to use AED because everyone could face the situation where they have to save someone's life. However, the number of people who can use AED correctly is very small , so local government should do something to solve this problem.  We students are taught how to use AED in our school. So we can roughly use that apparatus. But in our daily life, we are surrounded by the irrational atmosphere. This case is one of them. Thus this is so difficult a problem. But the man's brave action saved the precious woman's life. So this man's action should be ranked.  I agree with you! When I was a junior high school student, I have been thought about usage of AED a little. However, I have just been thought in a PE class a few times and I don't remember it well. Therefore, maybe I can't behave bravely and help a person who is in a serious condition if I was in an emergency situation. I think that the government and schools should improve the training about using AED, too.  I pitied this man to read this article. I was impressed by his bravery and judgment! Probably, if I was in a serious situation like this, I couldn't take action as him. I think there are few people who can take action like him in Japan. I think that the government and schools should improve the training of using AED positively. Then, people who can judge bravely and use AED exactly with confidence will increase more. I hope that such people increase and I want to such person, so I want to learn about the saving of life and using AED.  I want to learn how to use AED accurately too. If people who can use AED increase, more people will be helped. However, even if we know the way to use it, we will get into a panic. So I respect people who treat correctly like the man.  I feel sorry for the man in this story. He wanted to save woman's life and he put into action to save her life. I think that he is brave enough to be regarded with admiration. However, people who saw what was happening called the police ! All we have to do is to inform people of accurate knowledge about AED in order to save such a brave man.  I agree with you. Man who rescue the driver act correctly. Why man should be criticized? Moreover driver learned about hoe to use AED not only in high school but also in a driving school. I can't understand this driver's behavior.  Action of driver of the vehicle and the police officer is quite unbelievable. I have learned when and how to use the AED at the high school, so it's natural for us to estimate almost all high school students can deal with the AED. However, driver and police officer, both adult, didn't understand the situation and even criticized man's brave action. I think not only students but also adults have to learn what is the AED and why and when the AED is needed so we can use it to help others' lives without hesitation.  Action of driver and police officer is very terrible. Kind man's help means nothing to them. I know how to use AED. However citizen as me even know this, I can't unbelievable that police officer doesn't know how to use AED. AED is very important thing. This machine can be life saver and killer. Our understanding to this machine is valuable.  I feel sorry for the man who saved the woman with AED. People should correctly know various instruments that save human's lives including AED. What the driver of the vehicle do is very poor. And the police too. They should change their conscious.  I can not believe this news because this man just saved the women's life but he was questioned. He should be appropriate for saving life. The driver and the police should apologize to him and they should know more about the AED.  How to use AED is learned at school. But the person with using that actually is little. And the person who can manage AED perfectly would be little, too. If good will of the person who has that is judged by law, what should we make grounds? I feel sorry for the man in this story. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police.  I think so, too. We should know how to use AED and act without hesitation.  I do not think it is a matter of lack of knowledge. Almost all Japanese school, they teach how to use AED. But they learn it without any reason. We need to take AED lecture more practically.  I think his comment is good and can agree with his comment to an extent. But, I also think his notion is a little bit idealistic. Now, it is the era of the sensitivity, and it is inevitable considering the tide of the time. "
JOC JOC-15A-01N 8.41 "Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. If we praticalize this technology, the number of car accidents and traffic fatalities will decrease. However, we will have one trouble. It is to increase driving without a license.  Autonomous car was imaginary technology when I was a child. But now, the fantasy is realizing and we can see the car moving with AI through the Internet. Today's advance of technology is very fast and some people are enjoying such situation, but others are struggling to catch up with it. I think that to consider problems that this current of the times may cause is important today.  This technology is very amazing. The number of fatalities will be decreased by this technology. But in other words, employment opportunities will be also decreased . Track driver, taxi driver, bus driver and etc will be not able to work. Therefore new employment must be given to them while this technology is introduced.  When I read it, I was so excited because I watched autonomous cars in picture books or animation in my childhood. It is a dreamlike technology!! Most of the traffic accidents in the world are caused by not malfunction of cars but carelessness of people. Practical use of autonomous cars may change this situations. In addition, traffic jams can be eased, we can reduce consumption of the gasoline. However, we have some problems about autonomous cars, so we should examine them carefully.  When I read the headline of this article for the first time, I was fearful about the spread of self-driving cars, because I think many problems will be found after they begin to be used. Certainly, autonomous cars may help to reduce traffic facilities, but if we really want to reduce traffic accidents, we have to utilize public transports, for example, trains and buses. They are safe, more economical, and environment-friendly. We are likely to be interested in the new scientific technique. However, we should give it more careful consideration.  I think self-driving cars are worth of being put into practice in terms of a decrease in traffic accident and a relaxation of congestion. However, the cars may not work depending on the circumstances perfectly. This system without judgements by us can cause tragic accidents. In addition, this technology will deprive people who like to drive of pleasures of driving. So, I don't think self-driving cars should replace all human-driving cars.  First, I did not have any images that Google is making a car, so felt a sense of incongruity with seeing the word Google with other names like Mercedes-Benz. After reading and trying to imagine the future written in this article, I am scared because worse things might happen. The scale of an accident is unpredictable. But at the same time, I understand how convenient it is. I hope the use of existing-driving cars and autonomous cars will properly be balanced.  I think it is a good idea to use self-driving car because it has a lot of benefits such as declining traffic accident. But I don't want to use this car in the future. Although it has a lot of benefits, there is no prove that self-driving car run safely all the time. I fear that the car may run sometimes without consideration for other cars or pedestrians. Thus, I want to use existing car even if Google let the self-driving car into the market.  I think it is really useful if the car move automatically, but I disagree with this opinion. If the big traffic accident happened between autonomous driving cars, nobody can be responsible and police cannot arrest anyone. It will make a lawless zone.  I think the technology of self-driving  cars is fantastic and people all over the world may be interested in this topic. Yet I have two questions. One is that traffic accidents will really decline in the future. Even if self-driving  cars are correctly controlled by computer, computer power is not necessarily perfect. The other is that driving license is need or not. This is why I disagree self-driving  plan.  I think that self-driving is good idea , but I disagree to use the technology of autonomous driving too much. There are three reasons. First, if the car lose the energy to operate itself, it might be in danger situation. Second, there is no guarantee that self-driving cars will never cause accidents. Third, automotive cars occurs the difficulty of finding employment, because the drivers won't be in needs. To sum up, I suppose that there are several problems to use automobile cars.  I think self-driving  car is a good invention but I would not completely agree with that we use self-driving  cars in ordinary. I have heard that auto-pilot sometimes be a cause of plane accidents; Automatic pilot is hard to be cancel. So human pilot can't do best drive. I think it will happen in the case of self-driving  car. Human assessment of situations is better than machine particularly in the exceptionally cases. I command people's driving. Now we have not to up to machine and rethink about human's faculty.  I am very excited to read the article and I am looking forward to autonomous driving coming. If autonomous cars can be used , our life will be rich and we don't have to have driving license. However there are some problems. According to the article , we has not secured their safety yet, so traffic accidents can happen like now. Also, we need make a new law about them because traffic system will change. When we trust in their safety, we would like to utilize them positively.  Self-driving cars are interesting and very useful. If we can use these cars, we will be able to drive with no driving license. This article said that self-driving cars are going to save millions of lives. However, I think they will have as many accidents as now because they can't do depending on the circumstances. So, when we use self-driving cars, we have to be more carefully to drive all the time. I think we will also have to get driving license to drive the cars in the future.  At first, I was surprised that self-driving  vehicles would spread around the world in the near future. Also, I didn't know that Google contributes the society of autonomous vehicles. To my surprise, the technology is not dream but reality so I think that it is not far away that we can go to space easily and cars can fly. I realized that one original action of a corporation can move world's market. In addition, I was shocked that traffic accidents kill more one million people a year. Self-driving cars will not only make our lives very convenient but also save them so I wish the immediately expanding of self-driving  cars.  When I read this article, I was surprised because I have thought that Google was the company of computers. If autonomous cars become the mainstream of automobile industry, the number of unexpected accidents will reduce and we can go everywhere without driver's license. However, I think it is not good to rely on the machine too much. If autonomous cars prevail in the world, we should be careful of accident while driving. And also, I have a question. If we can utilize autonomous cars without driver's license, can children drive autonomous cars? I think autonomous cars have many benefits, but they also have many problems. I would like to expect more advances of automobile industry.  It is true that some people say that autonomous cars are beneficial and useful for us. However I think we should deal with danger of using self-driving cars. For example, the government should enact a law that regulates the use of autonomous cars to some degree. And I expect that technology will improve.  I was surprised that Google was inventing the self-driving  cars. That's because Google is famous for searching system. However, I'm excited this new technology. If self-driving  cars become main type of cars, we may drive a car without any license. That is an epoch-making invention.  I was surprised that Google is inventing not only computers but also cars. I think self-driving cars will be very convenient for drivers. Because they don't have to pay attention to driving. And everyone can drive cars without licenses. That is very wonderful. But I am worried about the increasing of the number of traffic accidents. I was surprised that traffic accidents kill 1.2 million people worldwide a year now. The evolution of this technology is great. But we must give priority to the safety of people.  I was surprised at the idea of self-driving  cars. It is indeed wonderful that number of traffic accident would become zero by technologies of self-driving  cars. However, I suppose that self-driving  cars are hard to realize, because there are some difficulties to realize, such as traffic rules among the world. Despite it, I would be happy if Japanese automakers will contribute realizing of the car.  I think that self-driving vehicles are the revolution of the automobile industry. I was impressed by the news. However, I am worried about the vehicles. Because I can't imagine and feel a sense of incongruity about not driving a car by oneself. Though Automotive Engineers make an effort to improve the vehicles, there is the limit of the machine. Even if self-driving vehicles appear in the market, I will choose conventional ones.  When I read this article, I think the technology of self-driving cars is very amazing and useful. I cannot believe we may not need to take our driving licenses in the future! However, I suppose that it is not good to overestimate too much of this technology. We must not forget that a car is a dangerous vehicle that easily takes a person's life. The government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars.  I've heard about self-driving cars before but I wasn't able to believe that they would come true, so I'm very surprised to read this article and realize the rapid technology innovation. I think self-driving cars is very useful because people who are drunk can 'drive' and we don't come to be serious about drunk driving. In addition, we can 'drive' anything even if we are injured, in poor health and sleepy. As Ray Kurzweil said, however, if an autonomous car may cause an accident, it would be big news so we should consider the demerits. In my opinion, we shouldn't let young children drive. Self-driving cars allow them to drive without licenses but I think the time that they spend with their parents in the car is very important for them.  I have never heard Google makes cars, so when I read this article, I was so surprised. I thought I wanted to get into a self driving cars someday, when I was a small child. That my dream is coming true in the near future. Autonomous cars is a good invention, but it has a lot of problem. I think great developers will solve it and make our life convenient one.  The number of traffic deaths has a tendency to decrease, but it is still a problem. The self-driving cars may surely solve this big problem that technology caused. However, I think that it is dangerous to depend all on computers when cyber attacks become a problem nowadays. Is it the best way that the number of traffic deaths reduces by improving an each parson's driving skills after all? I wasn't surprised to hear this news title, but after reading this, I strong realized using this is still difficult. If all cars are changed to self-driving  car, of course, it's very convenient. But I don't think traffic accidents decrease dramatically. Indeed, robot technology is used in many field. In car department, it becomes remarkable point. But, computer is not perfect. Traffic accidents happened inevitably. I hope that perfect computer system is invented as soon as possible, and that using self-driving  car safely.  When autonomous car driving s will be on the market, we may not have to take a license. It is a wonderful thing, but we can not eo anything in stopping the autonomous driving. So people who riding cars have to acquire the knowledge about safe driving.  When I read this article, I was surprised. But, I think this project is very interesting at the same time. I hope perfect self-driving system is cultivated.  Although developing technology is great and important thing, I think self-driving cars are dangerous for us. Certainly, a number of people die around the world in a traffic accident, but they won't work suddenly. Without driver's license, we cannot do anything when they don't work. So we should be careful of introducing them.  I think it is no longer just a dream that the artificial intelligence driving cars and humans not do because in recent years, there are astonishing progress of unmanned vehicle. If these technology will make steady progress, that is not impossible to invent auto driving cars and if it will invented, they are very useful. Autonomous will decrease traffic accident and jam certainly, and if it will link with traffic light and make network that control car stream, it will change the society to more efficiency.  Of course self-driving cars are epoch-making investment. Introducing them into general use will decrease the number of traffic fatalities caused by driver's carelessness, such as drunken driving. But they might raised new problem. If cars would be completely automatic, people would not have to obtain driver's license, and delinquent boys would abuse these cars. I think we should not popularize them until new traffic regulation law system are developed.  I think that self-driving cars are very convenient because it is clear that accidents by the driving of the elderly person will increase in Japan. But I think that it is difficult to make it widely available because there're no guarantees not to cause an accident. Furthermore, there are a lot of people who want to enjoy driving by themselves. I want to drive a car by myself, too.  I'm still not completely sure that self-driving vehicles ""hold the key to reducing traffic fatalities"", but sincerely hope they do. If autonomous cars become safer than ones human drives someday, I will use them. Until that day, just hold on. . . Go!Google! I think autonomous cars are very convenient. In fact, they make the physical weak drive weak. However, if automatic system were broken, a big accident would happen. convenience is very important, but we should consider safety.  I did not know the existence of the self-driving  until I read this article. An eco-car running by electricity appeared recently, but now development of the self-driving  cars advances. If the cars spread all over the world, they will decrease traffic jam and accident. Moreover production of the cars brings big development and economic effect in various fields. For example, production of new parts, the computer which controls driving, fuel development and service using the car. But the article introduced in The I think autonomous driving car is good. If we use it, we won't be tired when we travel by car, therefore the number of accidents will decrease. Although it is the fact not to secure the safety of autonomous driving car because nobody use it by now. If robotic technology diffuse in the future, its reliability will increase.  I was surprised, when I read this article. It'll reduces the burden of the people by this technology. It is very important because when the driver is tired, accident rates increases. So the number of accidents is reduced by this technology. I want the Google to develop this technology.  Knowing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I don't know the cars are developed to such a step. Certainly, if all of the cars in the world become automatic, car accidents will decline dramatically or disappear. However I'm afraid of this future because people will forget how to drive and in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability.  I agree to realize the society of self-driving cars in the future. That is because I think that autonomous driving contributes to decline the number of traffic accidents by preventing driver's carelessness and mistakes. But I feel fearful a little that artificial intelligence instead of us operate everything in our society. I hope the engineers in artificial intelligence take a risk of the intelligence into consideration and develop the autonomous driving system cautiously.  If self-driving car is come true, elderly people who can not walk by themselves can go around by themselves. And, this tech can reduce families' burden who want to go to distant places. On the other hand, tech is not perfect. So, if we can realize it, the number of accidents will not decline, I think.  It's really good thing because human can do more efficient things instead of driving. However, ""hacking"" is huge problem on this issue. Becoming self-driving car common means enormous cars can be hacked and they will be murder machine. Google has many hopes and issues now.  I don't think autonomous cars are ultimately going to save millions of lives. Without saying that self-driving cars will be convenient by most people. However, computer aren't perfect so accidents will be inevitable. In fact, there are many trouble by using computer. These troubles may not decrease in the future but I think it's OK , because If computer become perfect, people will be decline.  I think that autonomous vehicles are very very good invention. Nowaday, the traffic accidents are increasing. The more increasing the people which have vehicles are, the more increasing the accidents are. So, I must make ideas which are measures of the traffic accidents. autonomous vehicles are very great as the idea. Therefore, I conclude that autonomous vehicles are great measures.  This technology is very amazing and interesting. And it is also amazing that the number of traffic accidents will fall. Someday I want to ride the self-driving car. But I wonder if we can deal with them, when they malfunction or break down. Even if the technologies are fantastic, safety depends on our way to use them.  I think this movement is a good thing because I'm afraid of having a car accident and I don't want to get a driving license. If these cars appear in the future, we needn't go to a tiring driving school!! In spite of these good aspects, there are some problems, driving regulations, safety, license, responsibility of the accident and so on. In any case, this problem will take long time to solve.  I believe self-driving cars can change traffic conditions all over the world. they don't become tired, sleepy and unconscious because of sick otherwise humans do. Therefore, transportation using Self-driving cars is very safety. In addition, using self-driving cars releases people around the world from traffic jams. Traffic jams are one of the biggest problems in modern society. It is generally said that traffic jams caused by not to keep appropriate distance between a car ahead. However, self-driving cars can keep ideal distance. Thanks to self-driving cars, traffic jams will disappear in the future. Transportation using self-driving cars is very safety and making efficiency.  Self-driving car will help people who cannot drive by themselves, and it is a revolutionary technology. However, it is uncertainty that a self-driving car will not cause an accident. Therefore, I think that we cannot unconditionally say that it is a safety technology.  Of course self-driving  cars make our lives much more convenient than now. And they must reduce serious accidents caused by driver's carelessness. But they are not perfect. For example, self-driving  cars can't response to unexpected accident immediately. And they make children who don't have driving skills want to operate them. That may lead serious social issues. So, I think that self-driving  cars should not be popularized until their safeties become certain.  I think we can solve various problem if all cars become self-driving  cars. For example, traffic jam is it. All cars are managed by computer, and information of traffic is shared all cars. And then they think and flash way to arrive at earliest and most comfortable. The danger of traffic accident also largely reduced. So self-driving  car is very useful and we should expect completion of it.  Autonomous cars have a lot of merits and may make our life better. However driving cars is so fun that we want to drive by ourselves. For this reason I don't think that autonomous cars will win the market.  I think that self-driving cars is completed soon, but I cannot agree this system. It is because I think that the accident caused by the computer happens. Who is to blame for the accident? The government has a lot of need to think about including revision of the law.  Indeed technology and artificial intelligence should be advanced more and more. But if the autonomous car causes an accident , which people have a responsibility , do you think? Also most people have difficulty in answering the situation. And also nobody do not want to take a responsibility for the matter. Probably people want the company to take the responsibility. To advance in the technology is important for the people. But if we want to incorporate the system, we have to consider the law carefully and carefully.  Google thinks the technology of self-driving is better than previously driving . And I think so. Because if the car move smoothly , there is no traffic jam . Traffic jam is course of Global warming . That is our earth. So we have to do our best for the earth even if we can do only little things! I think that this technology is amazing, because it will reduce many traffic accidents. But if self-driving vehicles spread more, people who work as taxi driver and bus driver and so on will lose their job. So we should think about them.  I agree to self-driving cars being sold in the market. This is because it can avoid the fatal accident with the car, and people can enjoy a drive more comfortably. However, the self-driving cars do not secure complete safety. I hope that the safety is secured.  It is true that self-driving  cars are convenient and have the benefit that people who don't have a driver's license can drive. However, is artificial intelligence always correct? On the road actually, there are lots of dangers. For instance, there are lots of complicate traffic signs and children that suddenly run into the road. Therefore I cannot be relieved safety of self-driving  cars.  We should be careful when introducing the automobile cars to the market because it's fatal thing. Advance of technology is quite useful to improve people's lives, however, sometimes it invites an end to the civilization.  It is true that autonomous cars are very useful and they will reduce car accidents, however I think many people enjoy driving on their own. If driving becomes automatic, many people lose their fun of driving.  I think that self-driving cars are great invention in that we can protect the environment and we could avoid a number of accidents. But I don't think everybody likes the system of self-driving cars because there are some people who really likes to drive by themselves. So they should make cars which we can choose when to drive.  I think that Google car will be completed in the future. Now technology is so advanced that we can do what was thought to be impossible in the past Self-driving vehicles are very convenient for all of aged people. For Japan of the current aging society, self-driving vehicles will help them very much because the driver who cannot drive can go to the place where he or she wants to go to by self-driving vehicles. They will help not only the elderly person but also the people of the person with a disability.  I want car to drive. If this car could be true, I'm so exited! When I read the this article's headline , I think autonomous cars will make people happy . But when I read this article completely , I think autonomous cars will make them dangerous , too.  Until I read the news, I did not this news. So I was very surprised to read. Because it is amazing. When I was a child, I thought that my mother or father can drive with sleeping to go to disney land. Someday when I will a woman, I can drive an automatic car. But those cars are real safe? This article says traffic accidents will really decrease? I think if they introduce this system in earnest , they should be more accurate judgment.  When I read this article, I think that it is very wonderful invention. If there is self-driving car, the people who don't have a driver's license can move easily. Furthermore, it is good for environment if the car is an eco-car. The car which is good for both environment and a person is very great. However I worry that when balls rolled, what happens to a car? The car should allow you to react ti an obstacle, but a car does not push if forward before when I react to a too thing in front too much. I think that it is important seeing with the people's eye.  On the one hand, autonomous cars will reduce traffic fatalities and make it possible for those who don't have driving license to drive from children to elderly. On the other hand, because of autonomous cars, hobby, so called ""drive"", will disappear and fire taxi driver and bus driver and so on. Therefore, we must think carefully whether we introduce autonomous cars.  Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article ""Google certain of teleportation Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article ""Google certain of teleportation machines in the future"".  If we can use autonomous vehicles easily in the future, we can go anywhere without driver's license. Add to this fact, to use that will contribute to decrease traffic accident. From these points, we can use those vehicles easily and comfortable. But it will make the situation which there are lot of people who work as a driver will lose their job. Therefore I think to provide autonomous vehicles will do bad effect our society. So we should not generalize it which we use autonomous vehicles.  I was surprised at this article. Until I read this, I don't know Google's autonomous car. If this car is so safely, I want to ride in a car and go wherever I hope. The point which I am so excited is that people shouldn't acquire driving license. Otherwise, the point which we have to rethink is that streets and parking will change this style when autonomous car spread.  Reading the headline of this article, I was interested in self-driving  cars. At first, I couldn't imagine autonomous driving. But, I ensure that self-driving  cars run on the streets in the near future. Self-driving cars have a lot of benefits as the article says. Above all, it is a very good point for self-driving  vehicle to reduce traffic fatalities. I hope that the cars will be useful for people.  I also think that self-driving cars make our lives safer and more comfortable. Giving an concrete example, we can reduce the traffic accidents because of drowsy driving. If truck drivers can sleep in the cars running automatically, they can work efficiently after arriving at their destinations.  I mainly agree with this news because self-driving cars are much more safer than the cars which are driven by human. But I am worried about accidents which self-driving cars may cause in the future. I want these firms to make safer self driving cars for our safety.  I mainly agree with this article because self driving cars are much more safer than cars which are driven by human. However, I think that self driving cars are not perfect. I want these firms to make safer cars for our safety.  I am excited to see self-drive  cars! But If we buy this car, wouldn't we need a driver license? If so, I am going to be sad because I just get it last month! Though I am excited about self-drive  car, then, how will the trains work? It seems the same that we ride on the train and use the self-drive  cars. I am also afraid of our cognitive abilities will go down.  I accepted easily the idea that traffic accidents will decrease by self-driving cars. But, as miku14034026 says, there is no conviction. I agree with your opinion that computer power is not necessarily perfect.  I agree with your opinion. I don't feel like using this car either. The defects of the self-driving cars may be found, after they are used actually. And I think it's difficult for automobile cars to run a way where existing cars and pedestrians exist.  I did not think of the problem with job opportunities and it is something we need to consider. Even now, there are some exploited trains without a motorman. The problem is closer than we think.  As you claim, if self-driving cars become widespread we all can move by car including those who don't have a driver's license. However, people without a license don't have enough knowledge about driving. If a traffic accident is likely to occur, they will not be able to do anything. I think it is dangerous to drive a car without a license even if the car is self-driving one.  I was surprised at this article. I knew self- stopping cars, but l don't know an existence of self-driving cars. I agree to make cars. For the man, I like driving by myself, who is poor at driving the cars is needed. I would have Google company generate.  I don't know that autonomous cars have become very popular. I think it is very good to save millions of lives by them. I felt an era and techniques are changing even today. However, i think that i will become scary when i ride such an autonomous car. But a car driven by human is more dangerous than the car. . . . now, the traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving have become big problems I think. Self drive cars can reduce such as accidents ! I agree with your opinion. If self-driving  cars can realize, but there are problem. It is vulnerable of computer system especially, electronic disturbance. Computer system can hacking easily so if self-driving  cars realize, it is questionable for increasing traffic accident.  Driving license is need one I think because if car was hacked, the driver have to cut down the power and control car.  ID15081! That's good idea. I was surprised by a technique of google, too. Not only the car but also all techniques are great. The times when a car of the auto comes up come soon. I am fun! I have not realized the problem that many people use cars without licenses. And, I also think that when we are driving by ourselves and in danger of the traffic accidents, we are able to find the dangerous situations. But, if we use self-driving cars, we will not pay attention to situations and cause more accidents.  I agree with this idea. To drive cars without license is very good for us. Also, I believe that we rethink our life style. When autonomous cars spread widely, we use cars more frequent than today and the road is very crowded and greenhouse gas emissions increases.  I agree to . People should do by yourself as you can.  I was surprised at autonomous cars have become very popular. This topic is very interesting . Because they must be safety drive more than people . I think that car accidents will be disappear in the future. And if people go out to dinner, drinking alcohol , autonomous cars instead of the people . I hope that it becomes the reality early.  I think your idea is good. Recently, there are a lot of automatic things such as cars, and mobiles. However, these automatic things are not complete, so it is not good to rely too much. We should be careful around us.  I think so too. There are many traffic accidents and people who die in traffic accident, so if these automatic car prevail, the number of these accidents and people will reduce. However, if we ride automatic cars, we should be careful.  I was convinced your idea. If so, a long-distance truck driver can be more relaxed. There are still problems about automatic vehicles now, but in the future, these things will be developed and prevailed.  I agree with you I don't think so If the autonomous car became popular, almost all of traffic accidents would decrease. It is nothing but good things. However I think we can't depend on the safety of the autonomous car completely. The most important thing is the safety for autonomous car to become popular.  I didn't came up with the advantage. Certainly if the autonomous car became popular, we can use it when we drink! I agree with your opinion.  I agree with your opinion. Certainly if autonomous became popular, many traffic accidents can decrease not only the accident of truck but also train or air plain. There are a lots advantage, so I hope the things which is written in this article realize early.  It is a very difficult issue. Autonomous car is very comfortable for us, but if its system broken, it can't be understand when accidents happen. Also, this can be said for drivers.  I agree with your idea. If autonomous driving can't be controlled, we have to drive cars alone.  I tend to agree. Your opinion is very nice.  I read the comment, and agree to your opinion. I was afraid of an autonomous driving car. Even if an accident is caused intentionally, a wrongdoer can blame a machine. I think there isn't supposed to be such incident.  I agree with you. If they want to popularize the self-driving car, they should produce it perfectly. People will use that kind of cars when it is proved that self-driving cars are absolutely safe. I also want to take it if decent estimation is done.  Thank you for your agreement. We cannot relate with this car market situation, but let's see carefully about this topic.  I didn't notice that people who have a driver job will lose their job if this autonomous vehicles are used easily in the future. This problem is very serious. The progress of science will change our life and the system making this society I think.  I also have my driver license. When I read your comment, I also wonder about the same thing. Probably many people disagree with and many trainers lost their jobs.  I think so. And I concern about many people lose their jobs.  Self-driving is very interesting topic. Everyone is hoping that self-driving will be very valuable but still dangerous. It need to gain the credibility in the safety category in order to be spread around as general use.  I thought it was more important to give eye contact for listener than perfect English speaking. And we have to speed control of speaking for listener's understanding. But of course I decided to study English more for my next presentation ! Surely, some people can't keep up with the new technology. It is obvious to see the smart phone for the elderly people. However, in some case, it is necessary to desert such people for the advance of new thing.  I think that the news is so good for us. If self-driving car is realized, we could protect a lot of accidents. Also, old people can drive to feel peace of mind I didn't come up with your idea to increase driving without a license. It is very interesting. However I think we can solve that problem. For example, we make the car which cannot drive without scanning our licenses.  I agree with your idea that employment opportunities will be decreased. I like to talk with the drivers when I use public transportation, so it is sad to lose the chance of talking.  I agree. Indeed autonomous cars are very charming. We can expect them to reduce accidents and the number of people who die in accident. However, there are some problem. For example, if a accident happen, we can't understand who makes mistake. And when we drive them, we can't understand whether we have to have a driver's license. So we should discuss them.  One more thing that risk of self-driving car is hacking. Self-driving car is used huge IT technology and which means there are much more risks that hacking. Many specialists are warning that automotive companies have to take very strong measures for that of risks.  I didn't think about that point. Surely, if we left driving to computer, we would not be able to drive by ourselves. Not only in driving but also in anything, we have to do as possible as you can.  The point you focused is interesting. Should a license system be needed for autonomous car? This is a issue we have to think.  I agree with you . But I have some difference opinion from yours. When I read this archive I thought it can be on traffic Jim by self driving . Of course traffic accident decrease .  Your opinion is very interesting. We should think about driving license. I think we should think about drink-driving.  I don't think that the government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars. However, there are things to be done before those cars spread. First, security of them should be enhanced more. Then, the government has to make a law to clarify where responsibility lies when traffic accidents occur due to an error of self-driving cars. If these conditions are satisfied, I think the government doesn't need to legislate the spread of them.  I agree with you. I think so, too. Indeed, There will be a lot of arguments about safety problem self-driving cars have, but they will be came true someday.  So, what is the trouble?Will perfect autonomous vehicles need license?I cannot see what you mean.  I totally agree with you. Several pieces of legislation should precede turning self-driving to practical use. What an important point!I couldn't realize such a thing. . .  Your argument is clear, and writing is persuasive. I didn't think of the possibility of self-driving cars reducing or solving a problem like traffic jam. This is very interesting point.  Your point is partly unclear to me. Why will children with no driving skills getting to be interested in operating be viewed as a problem?Of course, self-driving cars may not be perfect in avoiding accidents. But how can children make serious social issue? The population of the truck driver decreases year by year, and the aging advances, too. The times when self-driving cars is necessary may be going to come. . .  I think so. This technology surprised us. Especially I sympathized the point you think this topic is interesting; autonomous cars must be safety drive more than people.  I agree with you. I could not notice what employment opportunities will be decreased. I think self-driving has both merit and demerit.  Your idea is interesting for me. But I think we should not too trust self-driving car. We cannot say machine trouble is never happened. We have to pay attention to situation of driving at least a little.  Realizing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I surprised that the cars are developed to such a step. But I think autonomous cars are two-edged swords. Certainly, if all cars become automatic operating, car accidents which are caused by human's carelessness will decline dramatically. However I'm afraid of this future because people in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability.  Increasing people not having the license may certainly be going to be the big problem. When automobile car is out of order, they can't do nothing. If it is emergency or being delayed, we will regret for not having the license.  I also think that autonomous cars can be effective resolution of two sides; reducing traffic accidents and traffic jams. The former includes fatalities, the latter consumption of the gasoline, as you said. So these cars are good for people and environment.  I also think so. It is true that Self driving car is very convenient and help many people who can't drive but If it happens accident, it's responsibility is whose? UNtil this problem is resolved, Self driving car should be not introduced I imagined the world that autonomous cars are spread. When an accident happened, who takes responsibility for the accident? There is a problem in such an area as well as safety. If the problems can be settled, we should make it widely available.  I think so too. If autonomous cars infiltrate our life, we will be able to live comfortably. However, It makes new risks.  I agree with your opinion. In this aging society, the accidents caused by elderly people will increase. But most elderly person can use only easy system. The companies should make easy and safety system. To help the people with a disability is wonderful! I quite agree with you. Feeling sleepy or tired lead to a number of traffic accidents. In my family, who can drive car is only my father, so he always says ""I'm tired, and I wish this car was a autonomous driving car for only a short time. "" when he is driving. So I'm glad to hear of this news and it is also good for the people who haven't driven car for a long time so called 'paper driver' like my mother.  I was amazing at this technology too. However, I was fear that driver is replaced by autonomous driver. Now, I go to school to get the driving license. I feel I can't rely on self driving cars.  Like you said, I also think the government draw up some new laws about automatic driving. If these cars are developed and people come to need not to drive by oneself, who has the responsible? We? The company which produce one's car? The other people? There have been a lot of problems yet.  I was very surprised with your opinion. I can not think that way and that aspect. New employment have to be given to the people.  I disagree with your idea because I believe the ""perfect"" self-driving system cannot exist. However great the system is, every system has the possibility of making errors. In addition, the biggest problem is the absence of a person in charge of safety. Therefore, I believe human beings should drive our cars on our own and drivers must be responsible for the safety of other traffic.  I don't think so. I think driving by human is much more dangerous than by machine.  I agree with your opinion. I am also worried if the self driving car can predict and prevent some risks. Indeed, it is very convenient that we don't have a driver's license, but I think quick decision and prediction of danger are human's peculiar techniques, so I'm scared that people completely rely on these artificial intelligence.  I think so. Autonomous car driving still has many problems. If autonomous driving cars were sold, society not absolutely prevents many problems of autonomous driving system like a drone.  Like your opinion, I was surprised at this news and autonomous cars have excellent potential to reduce the consumption of the energy for driving cars and decrease the number of traffic accidents and get rid of the traffic jam. But I'm worried that the only computer without us drives. When autonomous cars run on an expressway, if the computer is out of order, there is a possibility to cause a miserable traffic accident. I think that we should drive cars by ourselves until we will be able to put absolute confidence in autonomous cars.  I agree your opinion. I also think that in case autonomous cars bring about traffic accidents, there aren't laws to judge who have the responsibility in Japan. So I think we cannot see autonomous cars running on the roads in Japan unless we make enough preparation such as the law system and the confidence in autonomous cars.  I felt this article's idea is nice idea for something. For example , for traffic jam and traffic accident. But of cause it's not completely/ it's have to be careful for cyber terrorism.  I want to get on this car. However, If this car can't control by our own hands, when this car's service is broken, we are likely to die of traffic accidents. So, we try to do more things.  I don't want this self driving car . Because if we too rely on this car we cannot concentrate while driving. This is too dangerous. So, we are more likely to happen traffic accident Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. But I'm not going to take these car Your opinion is very interesting . But I don't think so. It is true that many driver will be not able to get a job, but they can get other jobs like a job to assemble a car .  I thought the same thing. To make the system that nobody can take responsibility is irresponsible. I heard Tokyo University is inventing the road assisting cars to flow efficiently on main streets. In this case, government take the responsibility.  I did not know the autonomous cars began to become popular, and they must be safety drive more than people. I think it is helpful for people with a handicap to drive by themselves. If that is realized in the future, many people can try to drive safely. So, I think that it is an epoch-making idea.  I agree with your idea. More and more useful things are prevailed in our society , it is good of course, but sometimes it hurts many people.  I agree with you in some parts. Self-driving car was a total fantasy that I never thought that it will come true. Just like our grandparents never thought smartphones will be part of our real world. science has provided us dreams and convenience that no other studies have provided to the human society. It became a fact that science has the power to improve our life. However, as famous quote states that ""absolute power, corrupt absolutely"", which means that not only powerful figure will be corrupted and give bad influence to the world but powerful technology can be a trigger to a corrupted world. That is why we have to be very careful about new technology.  When self-driving cars are populated, there will be a marked problem that it is going to face such as the safety. Safety problem will be the biggest and the never-ending problem for self-driving cars. self-driving cars will never be common unless it has overcome the problem of safety and gain the trust from majority.  I agree to autonomous driving cars being sold in the market in future, too. Using self-driving system, we will decrease a lot of fatal accidents and prevent traffic jam. Although this system is still future system. It is necessary for us to add improvement to the system.  I understand how you feel! Enjoying daily conversation in transportation system is important in our lives when you think about losing the opportunity. I do want drivers who love their vehicle to stay there and give children hope and dreams.  I agree with your opinion. There are a lot of benefits. For example to help many people who can't drive because of physical. So this invention will may help mainly the people who can't drive because of physical. And we should think a preparation of new laws.  I was also surprised and excited when I first met this amazing news. These days, not only automatically cars but also a lot of items which have been appeared only in SF world are invented. As you say, teleportation machines may be exist in a real world in future. Everyone may own robots like Doraemon someday. I want to see such a world till I died.  I agree with you. The manual license has been replaced driver license limited to automatic transmission cars now. In the future, no license will become usual.  By using this technology, we can make this world more useful. But, it has also demerits, I think. Too relying on this technology tend to cause car accidents. So we should use it in right place.  I think so too. If autonomous cars will be realized, although, in fact, autonomous cars are more safe than cars which human drive, I would feel autonomous cars more dangerous and cars which human drive comfortable. However, absolutely autonomous cars is profitable for human.  I don't think so. The self-driving  car is safer than existing car, I think. As you say, the self-driving  car is not perfect. But, Google tries to make it nearly perfect. So, I believe this cars.  I also think it is important to consider not only the convenience of autonomous cars but also the safety of them.  Your idea is very interesting. This technology will reduce the number of traffic accident. But I think the drivers don't have to get driving licenses because they won't drive by themselves.  I think also the development of autonomous cars will be our lives more comfortable. But why aren't you going to take these cars? I agree with you. It is interesting if it comes true that perfect self-driving system is in use everywhere.  I agree with you. As you mentioned above, if the self-driving cars become popular, almost all of the traffic accidents would disappear. I also think it is important to make safe self-driving cars I was imagining the car which is autonomous too. Today, from now on we will be in new trouble .  I can see what you are saying. We tend to be interested in new technologies and we tend to think we have to use them. But It's not true. As you say, we can use public transportation to reduce traffic accident instead of using cars.  I agree with your opinion. The technology should be developed carefully When I saw this news, I partly feel happy because I am very bad at driving but at the same time I feel sad because these days I gradually start enjoying driving. I think driving is kind of sports or exercise. I know it occurs so many death accident, but people have been driving for a long years and it also became our culture. people compete their skill of driving. sometimes boys tried to drive their car really cool in from of girls. I liked such kind of culture. of course non-driver cars will bring us safer more comfortable future, but if everything make automatic, people will lose their own way and lose competence.  It is a trendy topic in Japan now because the three biggest car companies, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, are making self-driving cars and Prime minister Abe tried to get in the car, which Toyota invented. I watched this news recently and it said that they would be running on the public roads in 5 years. However I'm not excited that it will be real. I feel like everything will be robot like the stuffs in the hotel's front and these self-driving cars. I'm sure that Japan have great technologies and I'm proud of them but it is getting too much. I'm wandering who have responsibilities when car accidents occur. I feel people no longer are needed and we will not have to work. It will make people more lazy and I'm afraid of people will get foolish because we don't have to work, perhaps we will not need to study. Also I'm afraid of loosing our tradition and culture. Japanese technologies can be our culture but I want to keep out culture which has protected for long time. "
JOC JOC-15A-09N 9.93 "I don't know advancing the construction of a new US base by the governments of Japan and the United States is right or not. If it is not right, we have to prevent Japan from moving in the wrong direction. As Kenzaburo Oe believes and Yoichi Higuchi says, we should believe citizens protesting and support them.  I believe that the governments of Japan and the United States should not advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. First of all, there are many people who oppose to build new base at Henoko. Japanese government should listen to their voices. Additionally, nature and ecology of the sea at Henoko would be destroyed by building new base. All in all, we have to oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. We should not only talk but also take actions to protect land and people of Okinawa.  I oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko because Japanese government ignore the voices of people in Okinawa. We should take actions to prevent building new base.  I can't agree with the construction of a new US base in the Henoko district. Because it may lead to destruction of the environment. Beautiful sea which various kinds of sea creatures live in should be protected. Moreover, the mental burden on the locals will be too large. I disagree with the move to revise national security legislation and the constitution too. I want Japan to remain a peaceful country as it is Around Henoko of Okinawa where the mammalian dugongs of the sea in the crisis of the extinction inhabit is one of the sea areas where biodiversity is the richest in Japan. A human being does not have the right to break the variety into. If Japan and the United States which are a developed country take the lead to perform the environmental disruption while the world sings environmental protection, the other countries must be angry. I think that they should think about not only the political element but also the environmental element and should make a conclusion for the issue of transference.  I think so, too. Environment is not the thing which a human being may destroy. In addition, the human being grows by nature, and anyone know that we are healed by its beautiful scenery. I think that the transference supporter should reconsider such a natural idea.  I oppose to advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko, too. Now, the relationship between the Japanese government and Okinawa is not good because of US bases problem. It is important to discuss the political issues. In addition, I assume we need to think about the environmental issues to protect the beautiful environment in Okinawa.  I support Abe on this point. The construction of a new US base is necessary for Japan. Protesters are usually emotional and what they say is a little worthy of listening to. To cope with threat od China, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity. The right of self-defense is guaranteed as the natural right. So, there is no problem that Japan exercise the self-defense right.  To begin with, there was an agreement with America. The Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama spoiled it. If he had not become the Prime Minister, the construction of a new US base would have advanced.  X= people in Okinawa necessarily disagree O= people in Okinawa do not necessarily disagree This is the first time I've heard this. I oppose the construction of a new US base. We should protect nature and beautiful scene. I think it good that famous persons like Oe take concrete action. And Japanese government has to lend an ear to the voice of the people living in Okinawa.  I think so. If more US base is construct in Okinawa, it will impose a burden on Okinawa. And the friction between Japanese government and Okinawa will worsen. So, I think Japan and the United States should not advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko.  I often go to Okinawa. Seas in Okinawa are very beautiful. We can look fish which is swimming because water is very clean. Therefore I strongly believe that we should protect the nature in Okinawa. In addition I really looked Okinawa US base. Then I was very surprised because airplane was very fast and very noisy. I think that US bases are very dangerous and harm for people who live in Okinawa. All in all, I think that we should think about US bases and produce the solution.  I agree with you. Sea in Okinawa is very beautiful and there are many farms of sugarcane. I strongly believe that we should protect these nature. If we set up the US base in Okinawa, it connect to destroy the nature of Okinawa. In addition, US bases are very dangerous. Therefore Japanese people should insist that stop to set up the US bases in Okinawa.  Unfortunately, I have never been to Okinawa. However, I often see clear sea in Okinawa on TV and the Internet. Nature is great and respectable. If China attacked and occupied Okinawa, a lot of factories would be constructed. The factory would emit toxic sewage and smoke. Therefore transparent sea in Okinawa would be destroyed. To keep the clear sea, the construction of a new US base is necessary.  I disagree with Kenzaburo Oe for some reasons. It is true that some people say that the construction of a new US base will spoil clear and beautiful sea in Okinawa. However, China is threatening Japan with the navy today. So, Japan must more cooperate with America. And protesters such as Kenzaburo Oe do not show a concrete counterproposal. They are emotional and sensational.  I know it is not a good thing for Okinawans, and many Japanese people disagree with the new base construction in Henoko. However, although the Japanese people disagree with it, nobody help them. Any prefectures give their name in place of Henoko. Therefore, this issue does not advance for a long time. All governors in Japan should discuss about it, and if they cannot solve the problem, the Prime Minister Abe has to try to discuss with the US  Natural selection is inevitable. If the construction of a new US base were called off, it would be easy for China to attack Japan. If China attacked Japan, as a result, nuclear weapons would be used. Human beings would be extinct by nuclear weapons. Is it a natural selection? God knows it. However, we must keep the prosperity of human beings. Therefore, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity for prosperity of human beings.  I think this movement which famous people take the lead in insisting on peace is very effective because people tend to be influenced by them. People in Nago may be encouraged to have hope by them. Recently, the government of Japan attempt to change the interpretation of the Constitution, especially, Article 9. However, many people are against this idea. I think we should protect Article 9 just as it is because it is a symbol of Japanese peace. It has passed 70 years since the Second World War was over. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and think about Japanese future developments.  I totally agree and am with Mr. Oe's position against the construction of US military basement in Henoko since it seems that the government has not learnt we have so criticized about the base in Okinawa. Even if Japan are forced to have them because of the lost in WWII, we have to minimize the number of the bases as it produces lots of harms like noise and crash.  Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to take priority on thinking about our lives first. And there isn't much threat of China for instance and even afterwards too I think, so we don't have to extend our self-defense power. If we do that, it will irritate other countries of course.  I agree with Oe's idea, what the Okinawan citizens will win. And I also wish for it. I think the problem of Futenma air station is unreasonable. All people should have the right of living peaceful. So it is very dangerous thing to change the constitution. Not only Okinawan people but also all Japanese people who think so too should try not to happen the situation.  I think, if China want to attack us by nuclear weapons, they do it although we don't have the Henoko base. That's because Japan have many US bases already. I can't understand why we need more bases with people's pain.  I oppose new American base. Why the government disregard nation's voice. I think that what's he does is Japan before the WW2's government. And Okinawa's things is to reflection the people who live there. What Mr. Oe who works publicly act this like is the important things . Because famous person have a great influence.  I agree with Oe Kenzaburo, even though I don't like his literature. Although, where will Futenma base move to? It is impossible to move outside the prefecture. I predict that the base will remain Futenma.  I agree with your opinion. We have to protect the beautiful nature of Okinawa.  I have never been to Okinawa, but I know that there are a lot of problem about World War two and American armies in Okinawa. Henoko's people disagree with the new base construction. I agree with people in Henoko. Japanese Prime Minister Abe must try to discuss about American army with American politicians.  Okinawa used to be a one country since it had own culture. I think Okinawa should be one public culture. But Okinawa's own economic is not enough to support its country. "
ACA ACA-ACJ-001 5.4 "HOMICIDE This chapter deals with the approach of the criminal law to behaviour which causes or risks causing death. Murder, manslaughter, and several other offences are discussed, and one recurrent issue here is whether English law responds proportionately to the different degrees of culpability manifested in cases where death is caused. 7.1 DEATH AND FINALITY For practical purposes, the culpable causing of another person's death may fairly be regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. There is an argument that treason is a more serious offence, since it strikes at the very foundations of the State and its social organizations, but treason is so rare that it is surely permissible to treat homicide as the most serious form of crime. The reason for this is not difficult to find: the harm caused by many other crimes is remediable to a degree, whereas the harm caused by homicide is absolutely irremediable. Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects, the victim retains his or her life and, therefore, the possibility of further pleasures and achievements, whereas death is final. This finality makes it proper to regard death as the most serious harm that may be inflicted on another, and to regard a person who chooses to inflict that harm as the most culpable of offenders, in the absence of some excuse or justification. Although many deaths arise from natural causes, and many others from illnesses and diseases, each year sees a large number of deaths caused by ‘accidents’, and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in English law. For 1987 the statistics show that there were some 20,000 accidental deaths, of which some 7,000 occurred in the home, 6,000 at work, and 5,000 on the roads. By comparison, the number of deaths recorded as criminal homicide was 600, which includes all the  murders and manslaughters. This figure is relatively small when compared with many American cities, but that is no cause for satisfaction. There are still awkward questions to be confronted. For example, are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all, or even most, of the deaths recorded as accidents? In other words, does English criminal law pick out the most heinous forms of killing as murders and manslaughters, or are the boundaries frozen by tradition? Another question is whether the criminal law ought not to be wider in its application to activities which carry some risk of causing death than in other spheres. Thus, even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as ‘accidents’ into the law of homicide, there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work, safe goods, safe buildings, and so on. It was argued in Chapter 2 that the criminal law ought to spread its net wider where the potential harm is greater. It will be seen that English law does this up to a point, and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3. 7.2 REQUIREMENTS OF CRIMINAL HOMICIDE English law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter, as we shall see, but the two crimes do have certain common elements. It must be proved that the defendant's act or omission caused the death of the victim within a year and a day. (The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere.) The ‘year and a day’ rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that, if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death, it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death. Nowadays the problem is quite the reverse: medical science is generally able to determine whether D's conduct caused the death, and innovations such as life-support machines mean that life can be prolonged for months and years in some instances. In one recent case the victim of a stabbing died two and a half years after  the incident, having been kept on a life-support machine for almost the entire time. In principle, it seems unjust that a homicide conviction should not be possible in such a case, if all the other elements can be established and only the ‘year and a day’ rule stands in the way. But the rule was confirmed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, on the ground that a defendant should not be left in peril of a homicide conviction indefinitely. Surely prosecutorial discretion should be enough to prevent unfair convictions years after the event. The rule itself is out of accord with modern medical conditions and should be abolished. DEFINING MURDER: THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION (a) The Procedural Context If causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted, it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts. Indeed, many systems of criminal law impose a mandatory sentence for murder (or whatever the highest form of homicide is called in that system). In some jurisdictions this is a mandatory sentence of death. In others, such as those in the United Kingdom, it is the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. Why should this penalty be mandatory, and not at the discretion of the court as in other offences? One argument in favour of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment is that it amounts to a symbolic indication of the unique heinousness of murder. It places the offender under the State's control, as it were, for the remainder of his or her life. This is often linked with a supposed denunciatory effect — the idea that the mandatory life sentence denounces murder as emphatically as possible — and with a supposed general deterrent effect, in declaring that there is no mitigation of sentence available for this crime. It might also be argued that the mandatory life sentence makes a substantial contribution to public safety. None of these arguments is notably strong, let alone conclusive. The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes, but whether the definition of murder is  sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings, and only the worst killings, remains to be discussed below. Whether the life sentence is regarded as a sufficient denunciation in society depends on the public's perception of what life imprisonment means: if it is widely believed that it results in an average of nine years' imprisonment, the effect will be somewhat blunted. The same applies to the general deterrent argument: its effectiveness depends on whether the penalty for murder affects the calculations of potential killers at all, and, if it does, whether life imprisonment is seen as significantly more or less severe than the alternative of a long, fixed-term sentence. As for public protection, this depends on executive decisions with regard to release; it fails to take into account whether it is necessary for public protection to keep ‘lifers’ in for so long. This brings the discussion to a crucial point: what does the sentence of life imprisonment mean in practice, and what would be the alternative? What it means is that the time of release from prison is determined by the Home Secretary, on the advice of the Parole Board and the Lord Chief Justice, rather than by the judge at the trial. In procedural terms, therefore, the life sentence involves a transfer of function: normally it is the judge who determines the sentence (or at least its upper limit, since earlier release on parole may be possible), whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive, who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge. The Home Office is not bound by those opinions, and appears to depart from them frequently. In 1983 the Home Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers, terrorist killings, murder during robbery, and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children, fixing a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these offenders. Whatever the justifications for introducing this policy, it serves to underline the fact that sentencing in murder cases is enacted without each case being considered individually, after hearing representations from the offender's counsel, and without a sentence announced in court and subject to appeal. At present, the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods. Should those decisions not be taken by the courts, in  the same way as other sentencing decisions? The answer sometimes given is that murderers should be treated differently because they are particularly dangerous: anyone who chooses to kill once can choose to kill again. But this argument will seem less persuasive when we have discussed cases of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility: where a murder is reduced to manslaughter, the judge has a wide sentencing discretion and may, according to the facts of the case, select a determinate prison sentence, a hospital order, or life imprisonment. Those who kill and are convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility are no less dangerous than those convicted of murder, and yet the judge has sentencing discretion in one case and not in the other. Considerations of this kind have led the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder. In its place would be a sentencing discretion, which judges would use, in many cases, to mark the relative heinousness of the murder by a determinate prison sentence. In cases where life imprisonment was thought to be the appropriate sentence, the trial judge would still specify — in open court — the number of years to be spent in prison, taking the gravity of the offence into account, and release would be determined by a judicial tribunal. Such a reform would bring improvements in natural justice without loss of public protection. (b) Degrees of Homicide English criminal law has two degrees of homicide, murder and manslaughter. Many American jurisdictions have three degrees of murder — first-degree murder, requiring premeditation, and second- and third-degree murder, covering lesser shades of culpability. In England there has been a proposal that we should do away with all these distinctions, leaving a single offence of criminal homicide. That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage: the  only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone. The jury would have no role in most homicide cases, since a plea of guilty would be the norm. Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide: pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent, since there would be the possibility of argument in court (if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence), and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing. Moreover, the borderlines between the various degrees would raise questions of law, which would provide much opportunity for legal argument and for appeals. The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way, but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills. That cost is not difficult to justify where capital punishment is the penalty for first-degree murder. Where there is no capital punishment, however, the question of how many degrees of homicide it is desirable to have calls for careful weighing of the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (l)) against the cost and time arguments mobilised by the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3 (m)). The structure of the English law of homicide is rather strange. Although there are two offences, murder and manslaughter, the latter includes two distinct varieties: ‘voluntary’ manslaughter (killings which would be murder but for the existence of defined extenuating circumstances); and ‘involuntary’manslaughter (killings for which there is no need to prove any awareness of the risk of death being caused, but for which there is thought to be sufficient fault to justify criminal liability). The arguments therefore tend to focus on three borderline questions: What is the minimum fault required for conviction of murder? What conditions are needed to reduce murder to manslaughter? And what is the minimum fault required for a conviction of manslaughter. (c) Requirements for Murder In English criminal law there are now two alternative fault requirements for murder: an intent to kill, or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm. What do these requirements mean? Do they extend the definition of murder too far, or are they too narrow. Intent to kill may be regarded as the most obvious and indisputable form of fault element for murder, but to some extent that depends  on the meaning of ‘intent’. This has been the subject of a number of House of Lords decisions, and yet the definition is still not clear and settled. Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged, or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission. In this way, both purpose and foresight of practical certainty are regarded as part of the definition of intent, although there are other statements suggesting that foresight of practical or ‘virtual’ certainty is merely evidence from which intent may be inferred. How would this test be applied? In many cases the word ‘intent’ is used without elaboration, but there are some for which a full explanation of the meaning of intention is necessary. A fairly typical set of facts is provided by Nedrick (1986), where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to ‘burn her out’. One night he went to her house, poured paraffin through the letter-box and on to the front door, and set it alight. One of the woman's children died in the ensuing fire. When asked why he did it, D replied: ‘Just to wake her up and frighten her.’ A defence of this kind, a claim that the purpose was only to frighten and not to cause harm, requires the full definition to be put to the jury. The question is: granted that D's purpose was to frighten, did he nonetheless realize that it was practically certain that his act would cause death or grievous bodily harm to someone? The jury should answer this by drawing inferences from the evidence in the case and from the surrounding circumstances. What about the alternative element in the definition, an intent to cause grievous bodily harm? This has considerable practical importance, since this is all that the prosecution has to prove in order to obtain a verdict of guilty of murder. It must be shown that the defendant intended (which, again, includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty) to cause really serious injury to someone. The House of Lords confirmed this rule in Cunningham (1981): D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair, causing injuries from which the victim died a week later. D maintained throughout that he had not intended to kill, but there was evidence from which the jury could infer — and did infer — that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm. The House of Lords  upheld D's conviction for murder: an intent to cause really serious injury is sufficient for murder, without any proof that the defendant intended, or even contemplated, the possibility that death would result. Does the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule extend the definition of murder too far? If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction, it can be argued that the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule draws the line too low. In terms of principle, the rule requires justification because it departs from the principle of correspondence (see Chapter 5.2(a)), namely that the fault element in a crime should relate to the consequences prohibited by that crime. By allowing an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to suffice for a murder conviction, the law is violating a general principle, turning the most serious of its offences into a constructive crime. Why should it be necessary to ‘construct’ a murder conviction out of this lesser intent? There are arguments in favour of this: death is final, murder is the gravest crime, and there is no significant moral difference between someone who chooses to cause really serious injury and someone who sets out to kill. No one can predict whether a serious injury will result in death — that may depend on the victim's physique, on the speed of an ambulance, on the distance from the hospital, and on a range of other medical and individual matters. If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another, it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death, and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label ‘murder’ if death results. The counter-arguments, which would uphold the principle of correspondence, are that breach of that principle is unnecessary when the amplitude of the crime of manslaughter lies beneath murder, and also that the definition of grievous bodily harm includes a number of injuries which are most unlikely to put the victim's life at risk. In the leading case of Cunningham Lord Edmund-Davies (dissenting) gave the example of breaking someone's arm: that is a really serious injury, but one which is unlikely to endanger the victim's life. So in practice the ‘grievous bodily harm’ rule goes further than the arguments of its protagonists would support. Would it be right, then, to confine the fault element in murder to an intent to kill? That would have the merit of simplicity, but would  it strike the right note socially? There are powerful arguments in favour of saying that there are other killings where an intent to kill cannot be established, and yet where the moral or social culpability is equal to that in most intentional killings. Of course, one cannot be adamant about whether they merit the label ‘murder’, because that is a question of drawing the line between murder and manslaughter, which is not susceptible of any precise resolution. It is hard to argue conclusively that the category of murder should be smaller or larger (unless the death penalty or a mandatory life sentence follows); it is a question of social judgment. Let us briefly consider some of the possibilities. The fault element for many serious offences is intent or recklessness: why should this not suffice for murder? The question is whether all killings in which the defendant is aware of the risk of death are sufficiently serious to warrant the term ‘murder’. One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue. This example assumes that a sympathy for motorists with overwhelm any tendency to logical analysis. One might ask whether motorists are ever justified in knowingly taking risks with other people's lives. Yet if the example is modified a little, so that the overtaking is on a country road at night and the risk is known to be slight, it becomes questionable whether the causing of death in these circumstances should be labelled in the same way as intentional killings. This is not to suggest that motorists should be treated differently. The point is rather that, even though knowingly taking risks with other people's lives is usually unjustifiable, taking a slight risk is less serious than intentionally causing death. In discussing the boundaries of murder, we are concerned with classification, not exculpation. To classify all reckless killings as murder might be too broad, but the point remains that some reckless killings may be thought no less heinous than intentional killings. Can a satisfactory line be drawn here? One approach would be to draw the line by reference to the degree of probability. Murder is committed in those situations where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result. A version of this test of foresight of high probability is used in several other European  countries; it was introduced into English law by the decision in Hyam v.  DPP (1975), but abandoned in Moloney (1985) on grounds of uncertainty. A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant's conduct. Section 210.2 of the Model Penal Code includes within murder those reckless killings which manifest ‘extreme indifference to the value of human life’. Scots law treats as murder killings with ‘wicked recklessness’, a phrase which directs the court's attention to the circumstances of the killing. Both the Model Penal Code test and the Scots test may be reduced to circularity, however, for when one asks how extreme or how wicked the recklessness should be, the only possible answer is: ‘wicked or extreme enough to justify the stigma of a murder conviction’. Admittedly, the Model Penal Code does contain a list of circumstances which may amount to extreme indifference, which assists the courts and increases the predictability of verdicts in a way that Scots law does not, but the essence of both approaches is that there is no precise way of describing those non-intentional killings which are as heinous as intentional killings. Their protagonists argue that the law of murder is so important socially that derogation from the principle of maximum certainty should be allowed in favour of more accurate labelling by the courts; opponents argue that the principle of maximum certainty is needed here specifically to reduce the risk of verdicts based on discriminatory or irrelevant factors, such as distaste for the defendant's background, allegiance, or other activities. A third, more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, namely, that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death. Neither an intention to cause serious injury  nor recklessness as to death should be sufficient on its own, but together they restrict one another, producing a test which both satisfies the criterion of certainty and marks out some heinous but non-intended killings. A fourth approach, adopted by English law until 1957 and still in force in many American jurisdictions, is some form of felony-murder rule: anyone who kills during the course of a felony (or, more restrictively, a serious crime of violence) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder. Thus stated, there is no reference to the defendant's intention or awareness of the risks: the fact that D has chosen to commit rape, robbery, or another serious offence, and has caused death thereby, is held to constitute sufficient moral grounds for placing the killing in the highest category. Plainly, this is a form of constructive criminal liability: the murder conviction is constructed out of the ingredients of a lesser offence. Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence, and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue, however unforeseeable they may be. The objections would be reduced if awareness of the risk of death was also required: in other words, if the test were the commission of a serious offence of violence plus recklessness as to death. The effect of that test would be to pick out those reckless killings which occurred when D had already manifested substantial moral and legal culpability, and to classify them as murder. Four alternative approaches have been described, and many others could be listed. The point is that the traditional concepts of intention and recklessness do not, of themselves, appear to be sufficiently well focused to mark out those killings which are the most heinous. The law must resort to some kind of moral and social evaluation of conduct if it is to identify and separate out the most heinous killings. Many people might think that a person who causes death whilst using an unlawfully held firearm or explosives ought to be convicted of murder because there is, generally speaking, no excuse for using such dangerous equipment. Some of the people thus covered would be armed robbers, others would be terrorists. The armed robber might say that he had no intention of using the firearm, that he carried it with him simply to frighten the victim, and  that it went off accidentally: if the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder? The terrorist might say that he gave sufficient warning of the bomb for the area to be cleared, and that it was unforeseeable that a deaf person should remain on the premises and be killed in the explosion, which was intended only to cause damage. If the jury believes that, should he be convicted of murder? It is possible that juries would prefer to convict of murder in such cases so as to register their abhorrence of the defendant's activities in general. If so, this would suggest a social preference for regarding killings of these kinds as among the worst because of the circumstances in which they occur, rather than because of the defendant's awareness of the possible consequences. However, the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, which reviewed the matter thoroughly in the early 1950s, and later law-reform committees have accorded preference to the ‘general principle’ that ‘persons ought not to be punished for consequences of their acts which they did not intend or foresee’. A conviction for manslaughter would be sufficient to mark the gravity of those cases in which D was not aware of the risk of death, and the court would have ample discretion in sentencing to reflect the blameworthiness of D's conduct. However, there would have to be clear parameters of sentencing in order to avoid the intrusion of discriminatory or irrelevant factors at this stage. To summarize: the existing English law classifies as murder those killings where there was an intent to kill or an intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The reason for distinguishing between murder and manslaughter must be to identify and to label the most heinous killings as murder, and it has been questioned whether English law succeeds in this. There are issues of general principle at stake, but it is also true to say that there can be no absolutely right place in which to draw the line. The issue assumes special significance when conviction for murder carries a mandatory penalty, particularly when that penalty is death. 7.4 DEFINING MURDER: THE EXCLUSIONARY QUESTION Even in a legal system which had the narrowest of definitions of murder — say, premeditated intention to kill — there would still be an argument that some cases which fulfil that criterion should have their label reduced from murder to manslaughter because of extenuating circumstances. Just as the discussion of the inclusionary aspect of the definition of murder travelled beyond the concepts of intent and recklessness, so the discussion of the exclusionary aspect (i.e. which killings fulfilling the definition should be classified as manslaughter rather than murder?) must consider the circumstances in which the killing took place and the culpability of the killer. (a) The Mandatory Penalty It is sometimes argued that the main reason for allowing such matters as provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter is to avoid the mandatory penalty for murder. Thus, if the mandatory penalty were abolished, it would be sufficient to take account of provocation when sentencing for murder. This argument neglects the symbolic function of the labels applied by the law and by courts to criminal conduct. Surely it is possible that a jury might decline to convict of murder a person who intentionally killed under gross provocation, even though they knew that the judge could give a lenient sentence, because they wished to signify the reduction in the defendant's culpability by using the less stigmatic label of manslaughter. Since there are two offences — and particularly in jurisdictions where there are three or more grades of homicide — surely it is right and proper to use the lesser offence to mark significant differences in culpability. This may be seen as an application of the principle of fair labelling. The lesser verdict may also assist the judge in sentencing, and help the public to understand the sentence imposed. However, this reasoning is not accepted in English law for non-homicide offences, and provocation is not generally allowed to reduce a more serious offence to a less serious offence — probably for reasons associated with the policy of efficient administration (see Chapter 3.3(m)), which the significance of death is thought to outweigh in homicide cases. (b) Manslaughter upon Provocation Provoked killings are generally thought to be less heinous than unprovoked killings, and provocation has long been accepted as a ground for reducing to manslaughter a killing which would otherwise fulfil the definition of murder. From time to time there are cases where the provocation is so gross and so strong that a court imposes a very short prison sentence or even a suspended sentence for the manslaughter — typically, cases where a wife, son, or daughter kills a persistently bullying husband or father — and such cases raise the more general question of whether provocation should ever be a complete defence to homicide or to other crimes. That question was discussed in Chapter 6.5 above. The issue here is whether provocation should remain a qualified defence to murder, and, if so, how far it should extend. In English law the doctrine of provocation has two main elements, both of which are laid down in section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957. First, there must be evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill. Second, the jury must decide whether the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as D did. D is not required to prove any of this: in a murder trial, if there is sufficient evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, the judge is bound to leave provocation to the jury, and the burden of disproving it beyond reasonable doubt lies upon the prosecution. (i)The Subjective Requirement . The first requirement of the qualified defence of provocation is predominantly subjective — evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control and kill. This requirement contributes to the excusing element in the provocation doctrine, the idea being that a person who has lost self-control is less responsible for subsequent conduct. Without this element, there would be no way of excluding planned revenge killings, and the argument is that they should be excluded from the defence because a person who plans a response to an affront or a wrong ought to ensure that the response conforms with the law. The genuinely provoked killer, on the other hand, is in such a disturbed state of mind that such calculation does not occur. How disturbed does this state of mind have to be? The concept of loss of self-control has received little close attention from lawyers. Such phrases as ‘loss of temper’ or ‘heat of passion’are treated  as useful synonyms, for which angry or apparently uncontrolled reactions may be treated as evidence. One matter which is viewed as significant is a short space of time between the provocation and the killing, and there are some judicial statements which treat this as a matter of law: the loss of self-control must, it is sometimes held, be ‘sudden and temporary’. Thus in Ibrams (1982) there had been considerable ill-treatment and violence by the deceased towards D and his girlfriend, and this led them eventually to plan and carry out a night-time raid on the deceased's flat, during which they attacked and killed him. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the defence of provocation was unavailable; even if D had lost his self-control at the time, it was hardly a sudden and temporary response to an act of the deceased, who was asleep when D struck him. Differing slightly from Ibrams are the many cases where ‘cumulative provocation’ has been directed towards D over a period of time, and then some minor act sparks off the loss of self-control and killing. In cases of this kind (which rarely come before the Court of Appeal except on appeal against sentence), the last act of the provoker, even though minor in itself, may be placed in the context of the previous provocation, and may itself be treated as sufficient to show that the loss of self-control was ‘sudden and temporary’. However, there is no reference to a requirement of ‘suddenness’ in the Homicide Act 1957, and the courts have in effect restricted the defence to people with certain kinds of temperament. It is one thing to exclude cases like Ibrams from the defence — the gap of some five days between provocation and killing savours of considered revenge; it is another thing to exclude defendants with slow-burning temperaments, who do not react straight away to an insult or wrong, but go away and then react after hours of festering anger. Should a court be prevented from hearing and acting on evidence that, despite the lapse of a few hours, a defendant's temperament was such that it is fair to say that he or she was provoked to lose self-control, and that it was not calculated revenge? The Homicide Act requires evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control: this is wide enough to include things said or done by persons other than the deceased, and acts done against persons other than D (e.g. where D is provoked to kill someone who has just committed a sexual offence upon D's son, daughter, wife, etc.). But  the word ‘provoked’ does seem to require a human act rather than a natural event which leads D to lose self-control. Thus, in Doughty (1986), the crying of a 17-day-old child was held to be sufficient to fall within the requirement (even though such an infant is not aware of the significance of what he or she is doing), whereas someone who loses self-control after a storm or explosion has destroyed his property would be outside the requirement. These restrictions show that the subjective element is merely preparing the ground for the objective element; it is not part of a broader defence of emotional pressure of the kind discussed in Chapter 6.5(c) above. (ii)The Objective Condition . Once the court is satisfied that there is evidence that D was provoked to lose self-control, it must go on to consider the second requirement: was the provocation enough to make a reasonable man do as D did? This is English law's rather clumsy attempt to reflect the element of partial justification in the doctrine of provocation. The clumsiness is evident in the standard of ‘the reasonable man’, an anthropomorphic (and male) standard which might be taken to suggest a paragon of virtue if it were not for the context of partially exculpating a killing by such a person. The underlying point is that it is not every act of provocation which should be allowed to reduce murder to manslaughter, but only those serious enough to unbalance the behaviour of a person with reasonable self-control. In earlier times the judge would rule on the sufficiency of the provocation, and the result of this was rather narrow and legalistic categories of sufficiency (e.g. violence or finding a spouse in adultery were enough, but words or a confession of adultery were not). The Homicide Act 1957 deprived judges of their power to give authoritative rulings on the sufficiency of provocation, and the question must now be left to the jury, which should apply the test of the ‘reasonable man’ to everything said or done before the killing which might amount to provocation. There appears to be no time-limit on the matters to be considered, so that not only the final act but a whole course of conduct may be taken into account. If this is correct, it goes some way towards dealing with cases of ‘cumulative provocation’, and towards a broader defence of emotional pressure. How has the ‘reasonable man’ test been interpreted by the courts? In Bedder v.  DPP (1954) D, who was sexually impotent, was taunted about his impotence and kicked in the groin by a prostitute with whom he had been attempting to have sexual intercourse, whereupon he lost self-control and killed her. The House of Lords held that the jury should consider the effect of these acts on a reasonable man, without regard to the sexual impotence. The court seemed to be afraid that if it allowed the jury to take account of one characteristic, such as sexual impotence, then it would be illogical to direct them not to take account of another characteristic, such as irascibility or bad temper. It is no less illogical, however, to ask a jury to consider the effect of taunts of impotence on a reasonable person who is not impotent, and the Bedder approach was overruled by the House of Lords in DPP v.  Camplin (1978). A court should now consider the effect of the provocation on ‘a person having the power of self-control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to him’. This test demonstrates that the illogicality alleged in Bedder does not exist: some characteristics of each individual defendant must be considered by the jury in assessing the gravity of the provocation, but the level of self-control must be kept constant. Bad temper could not be taken into account, for that is plainly inconsistent with the standard of reasonable self-control. Mental imbalance should also be excluded, since that seems inconsistent with the idea of an ‘ordinary person’, and the defence should be one of diminished responsibility. Intoxication is plainly outside the test: if the provocation was not enough to lead an ordinary sober person to do as D did, then the essence of D's defence is intoxication rather than provocation. The criteria adopted by the Court of Appeal in Newell (1980) were that courts should only take account of characteristics with which the provocation was concerned; permanent characteristics such as race and, probably, religion may be taken into account, but transient conditions such as intoxication and exhaustion may not. The underlying idea is that citizens are expected to keep control over their behaviour, but that in circumstances where even a person of normal self-control might be provoked, the offence may be reduced from murder to manslaughter. The required standard of self-control is kept fairly constant, but in order to assess the strength of the provocation, it is necessary to consider the relevant personal  characteristics. This demonstrates the interaction between the excusing elements in provocation (not just the loss of self-control, but the degree of provocation experienced) and the justificatory elements (to an extent, D was right to react angrily to what had been said or done, unless the alleged provocation was self-induced or was a legally justified act). The interaction between these elements is a complex one, as we saw in Chapter 6.5. Thus, the standard of self-control is not constant but may vary, according to Camplin , with the age and sex of the defendant. To modify the standard where D is very young (Camplin was 15) is understandable: it is not fair to expect a youth to show the same level of self-restraint as an adult. The idea of having different standards for males and females has not been elaborated by the English courts. Clearly, sex may be a relevant characteristic in some cases, for some provocations are specific to one sex, but is there an argument for different standards of self-control for males and females? Does the plight of battered wives who kill after a spate of ill-treatment warrant special treatment by the law? (iii)A Further Requirement? At common law the famous case of Mancini v.  DPP (1942) held that the retaliation must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation. The idea was that only an extremely grave provocation ought to mitigate a killing with a deadly weapon, whereas a lesser provocation might be allowed to mitigate other killings. This rule seemed to be modelled on the proportionality requirement in self-defence, and was criticized as quite unsuitable for cases of provocation, where loss of self-control intervenes between the provocation and the retaliation. Is it not both illogical and unreasonable to require a person who has lost self-control to ensure, none the less, that his response is not disproportionate? This counter-argument has been given some recognition by the courts, in that the ‘reasonable relationship rule’ is no longer a rule of law. But traces of it remain, since a jury must still be asked not merely whether the reasonable man would be provoked to lose self-control, but also ‘whether he would react to the provocation as the accused did’. The precise meaning of this formulation is unclear — does it mean ‘lose self-control and kill’, or  ‘lose self-control and kill in the way D did’— but it seems to derive from the notion that there are degrees of loss of self-control. If that is the underlying proposition, it is important to dissociate it from the unacceptable idea that a person's acts after loss of self-control should still be measured on an objective scale. (iv)Provocation and Murder . The two key questions here are: first, whether provocation ought to reduce murder to manslaughter; and, second, how wide the qualified defence should be. The answer to the first question is closely related to issues of stigma, labelling, and widely held opinions about culpability. It was argued above that it is unacceptable to claim that the mandatory penalty for murder supplies the raison d'être for the qualified defence of provocation: the label ‘murder’ should be reserved for the most heinous of killings, and there is a widely held belief that provoked killings are not in this group. The second question, the proper ambit of the provocation defence, is more troublesome. It would be possible to absorb provocation into a wider notion of ‘extreme emotional disturbance’, as the American Model Penal Code does, so that the key to mitigation would be the extent of the defendant's psychological disturbance at the time of the killing rather than the reasons for it. One way of accomplishing this in English law would be to merge provocation into a widened doctrine of diminished responsibility. However, a central element in the common-law doctrine of provocation is the reason for the loss of self-control. If the explanation for the violent outburst lies in something which might understandably lead a person to be so angry as to lose self-control, then this supplies an added reason for mitigating the offence and the sentence. Thus the court must first ascertain the gravity of the provocation experienced by the defendant, and then consider whether this provides some excuse for the loss of control. This does not gainsay the fundamental proposition that it is every citizen's duty to retain self-control — at least to the extent of not violating other people's interests — but it does open the way to a manslaughter verdict and to sentences which are rarely longer than eight years' imprisonment (less than half as long as the time served by many convicted of murder) and may be considerably shorter. However, the significant reduction in sentence is probably connected with the normative elements in the provocation doctrine, the elements of ‘partial justification’. In the existing law  this is shown by the requirement of reasonable self-control, and by the (probable) exclusion of conduct known to be legally justified from the category of sufficient provocation. Surely it is the combination of the elements of partial excuse and partial justification (see Chapter 6.5 above) which raises sufficient exculpation to warrant a reduction to manslaughter. (c) Duress as a Qualified Defence In 1987 the House of Lords (in Howe ) held that duress should not be available as a defence to murder. Their Lordships devoted little of their speeches to the possibility of allowing duress to function as a qualified defence to murder, reducing the crime to manslaughter and leaving the judge to pass an appropriate sentence. This would preserve the principle that a person who is threatened must be prepared to undergo heroic self-sacrifice rather than take the life of a third party, just as the provocation doctrine preserves the principle that citizens ought always to retain self-control. However, the House of Lords preferred to see a conviction for murder in these cases, with the use of executive discretion to secure an early release from the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for offenders who killed when under duress, and thus appear to have reduced culpability. This is surely an unsatisfactory way of dealing with these cases, where the degree of emotional disturbance is likely to be no less than that involved in most provocation cases. The normative requirements of the defence of duress (discussed in detail in Chapter 6.4) ensure that it is restricted to dire and realistic threats which a citizen of reasonable firmness could not be expected to resist. The degree of emotional pressure on the defendant can almost be taken for granted in these cases. ‘If murder is to be reserved for those homicides which are most deserving of stigma, this does not seem to be one of them.’ If duress is not to be allowed as a complete defence to murder, the reduction in culpability should surely be reflected by reducing the conviction to manslaughter. (d) Killings by the Use of Excessive Force on a Justified Occasion Just as it seems strange and unnecessary that the law should have to choose between duress as a complete defence to murder, and duress  as no defence at all, so it seems strange and unnecessary that a killing which narrowly fails to come within the requirements of self-defence or other justifiable force should then be classified as murder. The Australian case of McKay (1957) involved a chicken farmer who, when he found an intruder stealing chickens, shot at him five times, killing him. The farmer's defence was that he intended only to wound the thief, and thought he was entitled to do so. In another Australian case,Howe (1958), D was attacked by a man, in an isolated place, whom he believed was trying to force him to commit sodomy. D took a gun and, fearing that this stronger man would renew his attack, shot and killed him. In both these cases it was held that the alternative of a manslaughter verdict ought to be left to the jury where the occasion justifies action in self-defence, or to prevent a crime, or to apprehend an offender, but where the defendant acts beyond the necessity of that occasion. Three reasons may be advanced for labelling these cases as manslaughter rather than murder. First, cases of ‘excessive defence’ have a grounding in legal justification, in that the occasion was one which justified the use of some force, and this places them on a higher social plateau than killings with no element of justification at all. Second, the defendant has what one might term the ‘lawful motivation’, believing that the actions taken were right and proper. This is a subjective, motivational factor which corresponds to the objective moral distinction identified as the first reason. Third, in some cases the defendant acts instinctively in response to an unexpected situation, completely misjudging the proper reactions in the heat of the moment: this is a similar reason to the second, but adds the element of emotional disturbance, which may explain the over-reaction in certain cases. Both the second and, more strongly, the third reason show that the doctrine of excessive defence may include a substantial element of excuse in its rationale, even though its theoretical foundation lies unmistakably in the concept of legal justification. The Australian initiative was rejected both by the Privy Council and the English courts, largely on the grounds that the common-law precedents were not compelling, that the full defence of self-defence should be applied indulgently in favour of those who use such force as they instinctively think necessary, and that the doctrine  of provocation might be used to accommodate other cases. The Criminal Law Revision Committee disagreed, recommending that a verdict of manslaughter should be possible where the use of some force was justified by the occasion and where D honestly believed that the force he used was reasonable in the circumstances. History then took a strange twist, for in Zecevic v.  DPP (1987) the Australian High Court denounced the doctrine of excessive force as too complicated for juries and removed it from Australian law. There is surely a strong social argument for regarding those who kill by using excessive force on an occasion which justifies the use of some force as less culpable than the ordinary run of murderers. Whether this moral — social distinction should be reflected in the law by introducing a doctrine of manslaughter by excessive defence depends on the importance attached to the principle of fair labelling (see Chapter 3.3 (l )). It is assumed here that juries and others do attach considerable importance to the label when it is a question of homicide, and therefore that the excessive use of force in self-defence is a matter which is properly reflected by a separate qualified defence, rather than being left to sentencing (which means executive discretion, if the mandatory penalty for murder remains) or forced artificially into the doctrine of provocation (when there may be no real evidence of loss of self-control). The problem encountered in Australia, of the doctrine being too complicated for juries, was the result of a six-stage direction which the courts developed; surely the essence of the doctrine can be conveyed more simply than that, rather than destroying it entirely. (e) Manslaughter by Reason of Diminished Responsibility Of the qualified defences to murder in English law, diminished responsibility is the most frequently used. From 1977 to 1986 there were about half as many convictions for manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility as there were murder convictions. The phenomenon is a relatively recent one, since diminished responsibility was only introduced into English law in 1957, in response to long-standing dissatisfaction with the insanity defence. Insanity was, and still is, a complete defence to crime, as we saw in Chapter 6.2 above, but its confines are narrow, and some persons  obviously suffering from mental disorder came to be sentenced to death for murder before 1957. Diminished responsibility has a wider ambit, but its effect is merely to reduce murder to manslaughter, giving the judge discretion on sentencing or other disposal. The wording with which section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957 introduced diminished responsibility is rather unsatisfactory, but judges, counsel, doctors, and juries have approached it with a compassionate pragmatism rather than with the rarefied verbal analysis too frequently encountered in English criminal law. The mainstay of section 2 is a wide concept of ‘abnormality of mind’, interpreted in the leading case of Byrne (1960) as a state of mind so different from that of ordinary human beings that the reasonable man would term it abnormal. It appears to us to be wide enough to cover the mind's activities in all its aspects, not only the perception of physical acts and matters and the ability to form a rational judgment whether an act is right or wrong, but also the ability to exercise will-power to control physical acts in accordance with that rational judgment. Section 2 does require that the abnormality of mind should be one ‘arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury’, but this range of admissible causes is sufficiently general to encourage a broad construction of the defence. The court must, lastly, be satisfied that the mental abnormality ‘substantially impaired his [D's]mental responsibility’ for the killing. The formulation is strange, since it suggests that one can measure a person's ability to conform to the law. In practice, it has been taken as allowing the jury to assess whether the mental abnormality was such a significant factor in the killing as to reduce D's culpability to the extent that the offence should be reduced from murder to manslaughter. In most cases it is not the jury who takes this decision but the prosecution, who, with the judge's agreement, accepts the defendant's plea of guilty to manslaughter under section 2. Some 80 per cent of diminished-responsibility defences are accepted by the prosecution, and only in around 13 per cent of cases does the prosecution contest the defence evidence and thus require the jury to apply section 2. What is the practical effect of a successful section 2 defence? In the three years from 1984 to 1986 there were some 229 such cases, of which almost half were dealt with by a hospital order under the  Mental Health Act 1983 (with or without restrictions). Ten per cent received life imprisonment, 15 per cent were given determinate prison sentences of between four and ten years, 10 per cent were given prison sentences below four years, and 15 per cent were given probation orders (with or without a condition of psychiatric treatment). These figures show the diversity of the cases dealt with under section 2, and they also represent a significant shift from policy in the 1960s, when around 70 per cent of diminished-responsibility offenders were given hospital orders. The decline in hospital orders and the rise of prison sentences are traceable formally to the practice of modern psychiatrists of recommending fewer hospital orders, and in reality to the more restrictive policy on admission to special hospitals being pursued by the DHSS, and also to the higher proportion of defendants who are declared to have ‘recovered’ by the time of the trial. No hospital order will be made where the defendant is said to have recovered, and the courts often feel it necessary to impose a prison sentence in such cases. Delays before trial can therefore affect the result, for a defendant who is committed to hospital and recovers there would usually be released back into the community fairly swiftly. Also receiving determinate prison sentences are those whose offence is reduced to manslaughter on a combined plea of provocation and diminished responsibility. Among those receiving probation orders will be those for whom the section 2 defence is used to mitigate a mercy killing. Should the qualified defence of diminished responsibility be retained? In answering this question, one has to contend with two muddles in English law, a general muddle about mental disorder and criminal responsibility, and a specific muddle about murder and manslaughter. The general muddle was discussed in Chapter 6.2(c) above: in principle, a person whose conduct was caused by mental disorder should not be liable to criminal conviction, but in practice the narrow and antiquated defence of insanity is rarely invoked in England (a handful of cases each year), and the courts normally proceed to conviction and then select a medical disposal where appropriate. The muddle could — and should — be cleared by introducing a workable mental-disorder defence, along the lines recommended by the Butler Committee in 1975. If such a defence were  available in murder cases — and the consequence of a successful plea would be to give the court a limited discretion as to the order to be made — the case for a separate doctrine of diminished responsibility would be weak. The second muddle concerns murder and manslaughter specifically, namely, that since there is no workable defence of insanity, it is often assumed that the existence of the mandatory penalty for murder is the essential reason for the section 2 defence. The Butler Committee argued that relatively minor mental disorders may be regarded as falling within section 2 simply because this outcome is thought to be preferable to mandatory life imprisonment. ‘The medical profession is humane’, commented the Butler Committee, ‘and the evidence is often stretched.’ That may be so, but it may be suggested that as much depends on the surrounding legal rules as on the mandatory penalty. If there is no workable defence of insanity, it is surely wrong to convict a grossly disordered killer of murder when the less stigmatic offence of manslaughter is at hand. And if the law of homicide makes no special provision for mercy killings (see Chapter 7.4(h) below) or for killings during extreme emotional disturbance, despite a widely held view that such cases ought to be treated as less culpable than ‘ordinary’ murders, is there not an argument for a fairly broadly defined qualified defence? (f) Infanticide This is a separate offence from manslaughter, but it is relevant here because of its close links with diminished responsibility. By the Infanticide Act 1922 Parliament mitigated the application of the law of murder to mothers who killed their new-born babies whilst suffering from the effects of childbirth. Doubts arose over the length of time which might elapse before the child ceased to be regarded as ‘newly born’, and the Infanticide Act 1938 extended the definition to the killing of a child within twelve months of its birth by a mother whose mind is disturbed either by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child. Infanticide is a defence to murder, but it is more usual to charge infanticide in the first place. The maximum penalty remains  life imprisonment, although almost all the cases each year (twenty or so) are dealt with non-custodially, usually by a probation order. Three interconnected criticisms of the law may be considered here. first, the definition of infanticide is limited to the killing of the child most recently born, which means that when a mother in a disturbed state kills both her last-born child and another slightly older child, the one killing is infanticide and the other may be murder, whereas the defendant's culpability is surely the same in both cases. If the essence of infanticide lies in the effects of the stresses consequent upon recent childbirth, then it is this, and not the age of the victim, which should be the basis of the law. Second, the law is gender-specific, singling out women for more lenient treatment. Some people take exception to this on the ground that it may imply that women generally have weaker characters and are less responsible for their behaviour. There is also the argument that the fathers of children may kill whilst overwhelmed by the stress consequent upon the arrival of a new child, and they should be not be left outside the law of infanticide. The third criticism is that the medical basis of the Infanticide Act 1938 is now discredited: the reference to the effect of lactation is without foundation, and it is acknowledged that the social pressures consequent upon the arrival of a new child (such as financial demands, unsuitable housing, effects on family relationships) may be just as likely to lead to the mental disturbance manifest in these cases as any condition linked specifically with the event of giving birth. In their evidence to the Criminal Law Revision Committee, the Royal College of Psychiatrists pressed for legal recognition of these wider social and situational factors. The Committee was equivocal on this, but recommended a formulation which would be broad enough to encompass these wider factors —‘the balance of the woman's mind was disturbed by reason of the effect of giving birth or circumstances consequent upon that birth’. Would it not be preferable to absorb infanticide into the doctrine of diminished responsibility and allow the prosecution to charge manslaughter in such cases? This would have the advantage of removing both the restriction as to the victim and the limitation to  women, but the Criminal Law Revision Committee thought that this would lead to an effective narrowing of the scope of infanticide. There might be cases of killings by mothers burdened by ‘social and emotional pressures’ which could not be brought within the definition of mental disorder which would be the basis of a reformed defence of diminished responsibility. Of course, doctors might be prepared to stretch those definitions in order to bring such cases within diminished responsibility, but that is an unsatisfactory basis on which to reform the law, and it provides the defendant with no legal protection against a murder verdict. The Committee's solution was to persist with a separate offence of infanticide. Would it not be preferable to broaden the defence of diminished responsibility so as to convert it into a defence of extreme emotional disturbance, applicable to both sexes? (g) Killing in Pursuance of a Suicide Pact Section 4 of the Homicide Act 1957 provides that a person who kills another in pursuance of a suicide pact is guilty of manslaughter not murder. A suicide pact exists where two or more people, each having a settled intention of dying, reach an agreement which has as its object the death of both or all. This may be said to amount to a mutual exercise of the individuals' rights of self-determination. Cases are infrequent, tending to occur in circumstances which evoke compassion rather than condemnation. The Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that killings in pursuance of a suicide pact should be a separate offence, on the ground that the stigma and maximum penalty for manslaughter are inappropriate in these cases. Suicide and attempted suicide ceased to be a crime when the Suicide Act 1961 became law, in recognition of the right to self-determination, but there remains an offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring the suicide of another which carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years' imprisonment. Many of the cases involve compassionate assistance, of the kind which may be necessary and justifiable if the right to self-determination is to have any meaning for those who are weak or bedridden (e.g. responding to a request to bring pills), but not all are like this. In McShane (1977) a woman was convicted of an attempt to counsel her  mother's suicide by repeatedly encouraging her to take an overdose, and it was shown that the mother's death would greatly alleviate the defendant's financial problems. It is for cases of this kind, where the evidence shows that there was active persuasion rather than compassionate assistance to someone already determined to commit suicide, that a substantial maximum penalty is thought necessary. For this offence and for the proposed suicide-pact offence, the Criminal Law Revision Committee (CLRC) recommended a maximum of seven years' imprisonment. This grading of the offences may be seen as a compromise between the compassionate elements in the offences, which are related to the right to self-determination, and the need to protect the vulnerable from persuasion on such a crucial matter as the ending of life, an argument also derived from the right to self-determination. (h) Mercy Killing This concept has no special significance in English criminal law. Where a clear case of mercy killing emerges in practice, the usual response is that ‘legal and medical consciences are stretched to bring about a verdict of manslaughter by diminished responsibility’. The Criminal Law Revision Committee regarded this bending of the law as unsatisfactory, and tentatively proposed a new offence of mercy killing where a person, out of compassion, unlawfully kills another who is, or is believed by him to be, permanently helpless or in great pain. The proposal attracted strong opposition, some arguing that it might withdraw legal protection from the weak and vulnerable, others arguing that the fundamental ethical problems could not be satisfactorily resolved by legal definition. The difficulty with the counter-arguments is that the practice of ‘stretching’ diminished responsibility gives a de facto defence to mercy killers already. Thus, in Dell's sample of diminished responsibility cases there were some ten cases with a mercy-killing element. Most of them involved ‘killings committed impulsively with whatever means were at hand’, usually by ‘men in their 60s or 70s [who]had reached breaking point under the continuing strain of looking after wives with severe mental or physical illness’. In some of these cases the  defendant appeared mentally normal when examined by the doctor, but the doctor was none the less willing to infer from the circumstances that there had been abnormality of mind at the time of the killing, and to write a report which brought this within section 2. Practitioners seem to accept that worthy cases of mercy killing invariably have this outcome, but this informal approach provides the defendant with no legal basis for a defence — he or she is truly at the mercy of the psychiatrists, the prosecutor, and the judge. Thus, to return to the arguments mobilized against the CLRC's proposal: the chief difference in protection of the vulnerable between the present system and the CLRC's is that the latter had a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment, whereas life imprisonment is available where a defence of diminished responsibility succeeds; and the fundamental ethical problems are now swept under the carpet by a combination of a stretched diagnosis of ‘abnormality of mind’ and the ample judicial sentencing discretion, whereas the CLRC's proposal attempted to make the issues justiciable. If, however, the CLRC's proposal were altered so as to make mercy killing into a new qualified defence to murder, with the normal maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the central plank of the opposition to an explicit recognition of this mitigation in English law would disappear. Beneath these arguments about legal form lie the wider issues of self-determination. English law might be said to recognize a right to self-determination, inasmuch as suicide is no longer a crime, but that right does not yield a clear answer to the present difficulty. The right to self-determination might realistically be extended to cover those who desire their own death but lack the resources or the strength to accomplish it: this is a strong argument for a mercy-killing defence or offence. Yet, recognition of that extension might at the same time open up the possibility that vulnerable people who do not desire death, despite their suffering, might be killed by others for reasons of their own: this would subvert the right to self-determination, and is an argument against a mercy-killing defence or offence. It seems probable that some doctors carry out mercy killings by administering large doses of pain-killing drugs which shorten life significantly, and the law may well protect them from  liability. However, such trust is not shown towards relatives and friends who assist suffering people in this way: they must run the gauntlet of a legal process which accords no formal recognition to the circumstances under which they killed. (i) Conclusion: the Murder-Manslaughter Boundary The basic legal distinction between murder and manslaughter lies in the mental element, but English law has now developed qualified defences to murder which mark out cases where, despite the presence of the mental element for murder, culpability is thought to be sufficiently reduced to warrant a reduction in the class of offence. Our discussion has taken a broad view of qualified defences, commenting also on some qualified defences which might be recognized but which do not feature in contemporary English law. Various reasons have been advanced for recognizing qualified defences to murder. Some regard the mandatory penalty for murder as the chief, even the sole, reason for these doctrines. It has been suggested here that the mandatory penalty is relevant but not critical. The key issues are, on the one hand, the proper legal classification of an offence which contains some exculpatory features, and, on the other, the distribution of decision-making power between the judge, the jury, and the executive. The label ‘murder’, and the stigma thought to accompany it, should be reserved for the most heinous group of killings; there is a well-recognized offence of manslaughter beneath murder, and this should be used for offences where the culpability is significantly lower. The mandatory penalty of life imprisonment for murder makes issues of relative culpability non-justiciable at present, since the length of imprisonment is ‘determined or partly determined behind the scenes by someone who has not heard any representations by or on behalf of the prisoner on grounds which the prisoner does not know’. If, on the other hand, Lord Kilbrandon's suggestion of a single offence of unlawful homicide were adopted, the crucial questions of culpability would be decided solely at the sentencing stage by the judge. The jury would have no role in this; the judge would derive no assistance from their verdict. What, then, should be the proper division of functions between judge and jury in homicide cases? The arguments in favour of some  seven qualified defences have been considered above. Since it is possible that more than one defence might be raised in each case, sometimes in combination with a defence of lack of intent, a system of criminal law which offers seven qualified defences to murder risks undue complication and confusion in contested cases. The merit of separate qualified defences is that they focus the evidence and the legal argument, giving the jury (in contested cases) an opportunity to assess the defence, and giving the judge fairly precise guidance on the basis for sentencing: this might be thought to ensure that each defendant is dealt with more fairly, but the risk of confusing the jury in a contested case might tend to erode that protection. One approach would be to consider amalgamating some of the defences. This is not to condone ‘stretching’ defences, using diminished responsibility to cover mercy killing, for example, or provocation to cover excessive defence, but rather to examine whether the defences have common rationales which can be drawn together. Three of the qualified defences discussed above have an element of justification — provocation, excessive defence, and some cases of duress. Most of the qualified defences have an element of excuse — provocation, diminished responsibility, most duress cases, infanticide, mercy killing, and suicide pacts. One possibility would be to evolve a qualified defence of killing under extreme emotional disturbance, following the lead of the Model Penal Code. This might encompass all those qualified defences with an element of excuse in them. A provoked loss of self-control could fall within this new doctrine — as, indeed, could losses of self-control stemming from non-human sources such as a natural disaster or financial ruin. Diminished responsibility could also be accommodated, although a general defence of mental disorder remains a better way of labelling and dealing with cases of clinical mental disorder. Cases now treated as infanticide often involve extreme emotional disturbance, as do mercy killings, suicide pacts, and cases of duress. One advantage of this amalgamation might be that there would be less potential for the jury to become confused, and yet the jury would still be empowered to reduce murder to manslaughter in appropriate cases. One disadvantage of the change might be that the more precise moral distinctions currently incorporated within the law would become submerged within the sentencing discretion, where the signposts are less clear and the arguments less structured. This might be the case with provocation, for example: there may be objections to some of the distinctions now drawn by the law of  provocation, but a broader defence of extreme emotional disturbance might provide for reduction of the offence in cases of loss of self-control when caring for a baby or when arrested by a police-officer known to be acting lawfully, and some might feel that there are strong arguments against this. However, such disadvantages could be minimized by elaborating the definition of extreme emotional disturbance so as to clarify its extent and its limitations, and by evolving sentencing guidelines which set out the major determinants of culpability. This would attribute some weight to the principle of maximum certainty (see Chapter 3.3(i)) in this important area of the law. Yet there would undoubtedly remain a considerable amount of discretion, both for judges and juries applying the law, if the words ‘sufficient to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter’ were retained, and at the sentencing stage, in response to the particular combination of factors in each case. Such a reformulated qualified defence would not encompass cases of excessive self-defence, since they may involve a genuine and unhurried misjudgment of the amount of force permissible, and so they would have to be the subject of a separate qualified defence. But the question remains whether, in practice and in theory, it would not be fairer to retain several separate qualified defences which labelled the circumstances of each mitigated killing more accurately. 7.5 ‘INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER’ The category of killings which has come to be known as involuntary manslaughter has nothing to do with involuntariness, properly so called. These are not cases where the accused has caused death while in an involuntary state. These are cases where death has been caused with insufficient fault to justify labelling it as murder, but with sufficient fault for a manslaughter verdict. The word ‘involuntary’ is therefore used merely to distinguish these killings from ones which have the necessary intent for murder but which are reduced to manslaughter by one of the doctrines just considered, such as provocation or diminished responsibility. The legal debate in involuntary manslaughter is over the lower threshold of homicide liability — where to draw the line between manslaughter and killings which should be ascribed to mere accident. There is, however, a large variety of killings which lie above that line but  below the line demarcating murder: a killing in which D knew there was a risk of death, but was held not to have intended death or grievous bodily harm, would fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a high sentence; whereas a killing in which D pushed a person during an argument in the street and the person fell backwards, cracking his head on the kerb and dying from a brain haemorrhage, might also fall within involuntary manslaughter and might justify a low sentence. The offence, as now defined in English law, covers a wide spectrum of culpability. Beneath the law of involuntary manslaughter lie some deep issues of general principle. For example, the offence includes a species of constructive liability, which was criticized in Chapter 5.2(b). Can this be justified by reference to the magnitude of the harm resulting, i.e. death? Or would it be fairer to convict the harm-doer of a lesser offence, thus ignoring the chance result? Another problem is the more general one of liability for negligence: as we saw in Chapter 5.3 (f ), this is regarded as insufficient for liability for most serious offences, and yet it may be sufficient for manslaughter. Is it right that liability for the second most heinous crime in English law, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, should be satisfied by this relatively low grade of fault? These questions will be discussed in more detail once the elements of the offence have been outlined. (a) Manslaughter by an Unlawful and Dangerous Act This species of involuntary manslaughter is based upon constructive liability. In broad terms, the law constructs liability out of the lesser crime which D was committing, and which happened to cause death. In fact, the courts have progressively narrowed this species of manslaughter over the last century or so: there was a time when the mere commission of a tort or civil wrong sufficed as the ‘unlawful act’, and when there was no additional requirement of ‘dangerousness’ to be satisfied. What the prosecution must now prove is that D was committing a crime (not being a crime of negligence or a crime of omission), that in committing this crime he caused V's death, and that what he did when committing this crime was objectively dangerous. Let us examine each of these requirements in turn. First, D must have been committing a crime. In many cases the crime which constitutes the ‘unlawful act’ will be a battery or an  assault occasioning actual bodily harm, arising from a push, a punch, or a kick. The prosecution must establish that all the elements of the crime relied upon as the unlawful act were present, and this includes the mental elements of intent or recklessness in assault or battery. To that extent there may be said to be a mental element required for this variety of manslaughter, but it is a manifestly low mental element compared with the death which results. If the unlawful act is arson (criminal damage by fire), the fault element will be intention or Caldwell recklessness, and the latter does not require any subjective awareness on the defendant's part. Where D was intoxicated when committing the ‘unlawful act’, it is likely that he would be liable to conviction for that offence despite his intoxicated state. If so, the offence is sufficient to fulfil the ‘unlawful act’ requirement for manslaughter. There are two types of crime which will not suffice as the unlawful act: crimes of negligence and crimes of omission. The reasons for excluding crimes of omission are examined in section 7.5(d) below. The reasons for excluding crimes of negligence were stated in. Andrews v.  DPP (1937), where a driver had killed a pedestrian whilst overtaking another car. There was little dispute that D had committed the offence of dangerous driving, but did that automatically make him guilty of manslaughter when death resulted? The House of Lords held that it did not: since the essence of dangerous driving was negligence, a driver should only be convicted of manslaughter if his driving was so bad as to amount to the gross negligence required under the third head of involuntary manslaughter (see below). Whether or not the decision was motivated by tenderness towards motorists is hard to tell, but there was certainly some logic in keeping offences of negligence out of the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine when a separate head of manslaughter by gross negligence already existed. Once it has been established that D was committing a criminal offence, the second step is to establish that this caused the death. In most cases of battery or actual bodily harm the causal connection will be plain, but cases involving drugs have presented difficulties. In Cato (1976) the Court of Appeal was prepared to hold that the offence of possessing controlled drugs was sufficient, together with the act of injecting another with these drugs, even though it is difficult to see how mere possession (which is the offence) can cause  death. In Dalby (1982) the unlawful act was the supplying of controlled drugs to V, who then took them. The Court of Appeal held that the supplying was insufficient as an unlawful act because it was not ‘directed at’ V. Subsequent decisions are unclear whether the ‘directed at’test remains good law, and a better approach to the facts of Dalby would be to hold that the supplying of drugs did not cause the death because V took them himself. The third requirement is that the defendant's conduct in committing the crime must have been objectively dangerous. This was seen as a slight restriction of the doctrine when it was imposed in Church (1966), where the court held that ‘The unlawful act must be such as all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognize must subject the other person to, at least, the risk of some harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm.’ The House of Lords has declined to narrow this requirement by demanding that D recognized the risk, and it has also been held that the dangerousness should be judged on the actual circumstances, ignoring D's mistaken belief about the facts. The Church test therefore appears to be broad and readily fulfilled, but the phrase ‘some harm…albeit not serious harm’ has been construed restrictively in one sense. In Dawson (1985) D, wearing a mask and carrying a pickaxe handle, approached a petrol-station attendant and demanded money; D fled when the attendant pressed the alarm bell, but the attendant then suffered a heart attack and died. The Court of Appeal held that the unlawful act would only be regarded as ‘dangerous’ if it was likely to cause physical harm, not if mere emotional shock (unaccompanied by physical harm) was foreseeable. (b) Manslaughter by Recklessness The most recent development in the law of involuntary manslaughter is the doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness. Although the word ‘reckless’ had been used many times before in the context of manslaughter, a distinctive doctrine was established in Seymour (1983). 4 After an argument with the woman with whom he had been living, D drove his lorry into her car and crushed her to death. The House of Lords held that this was manslaughter if there was an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person, and D had either failed to give any thought to this risk or, having recognised the risk, nonetheless went on to take it. It will be seen that this is the Caldwell/Lawrence formula for recklessness (analysed in Chapter 5.3 (c )), and is virtually the same as the test for the separate offence of causing death by reckless driving. The House of Lords accepted that the definitions of the two offences are the same, merely adding that the prosecutor should charge manslaughter when the maximum penalty for the offence of causing death by reckless driving (five years) might be insufficient. In Seymour the House of Lords seemed to be principally concerned with manslaughter committed with a motor vehicle, but subsequent cases establish that the test of ‘obvious and serious risk of physical injury to some person’ is applicable to offences using different methods, such as fire. (c) Manslaughter by Gross Negligence Although the authorities conflict, it has been laid down that the new doctrine of reckless manslaughter supersedes the older doctrine of manslaughter by gross negligence. Many of the old cases could indeed be subsumed within the new doctrine, but it does not cover them all. In the case of Finney (1974), where an attendant at a mental hospital caused the death of a patient by releasing a flow of boiling water into a bath, the test was whether he was grossly negligent. In Bateman (1925), where a doctor had attended the confinement of a woman who died whilst giving birth, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that there must be negligence over and above that which is sufficient to establish civil liability, and which shows ‘such disregard for the life and safety of others’ as to deserve punishment. Both these cases might be decided similarly on the Seymour test, but that cannot be said of Lamb (1967). Here two young men were joking with a gun; D pointed it at V and pulled the trigger, believing that it would not fire because neither bullet was opposite the barrel. The gun was a revolver, however, and it did  fire, killing V. The Court of Appeal held that D might properly be convicted if his belief that there was no danger of the gun firing was formed in a criminally negligent way. However, under the test derived from Caldwell , a person is not reckless if he thinks about the possible risk but decides that it does not obtain. This is the Caldwell gap, and Lamb is a case which might have fallen into it. It therefore follows that, if the courts have indeed replaced manslaughter by gross negligence with manslaughter by recklessness, they have narrowed the law slightly. It is more likely, however, that manslaughter by gross negligence remains in addition to reckless manslaughter. (c) Manslaughter by Omission The courts have been reluctant to bring omissions cases within the above categories, manifesting once again their belief in the separate moral and legal status of omissions. This was not always so: in Senior (1899) a man who belonged to a religious sect called the Peculiar People refused to call a doctor to his child, who subsequently died; he was held guilty of manslaughter on the ground that he had committed an unlawful act (wilful neglect of the child) which caused death. However, this very reasoning was abjured in Lowe (1973), where D failed to ensure that medical help was summoned to his child, and it died. The Court of Appeal held that a manslaughter verdict would not necessarily follow from a conviction for wilful neglect: if I strike a child in a manner likely to cause harm it is right that if the child dies I may be charged with manslaughter. If, however, I omit to do something with the result that it suffers injury to health which results in death, we think that a charge of manslaughter should not be an inevitable consequence, even if the omission is deliberate. This passage suggests that the law should, and does, draw a distinction between the blameworthiness of acts and omissions, even where the omission is deliberate. And yet the connection between withholding medical aid and subsequent death is surely closer than that between striking a child once and subsequent death. The father's duty in Senior and in Lowe is manifest and incontrovertible. If the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine is thought sound, these cases should fall squarely within it. If the doctrine is thought unsound, both the omissions  cases and the act cases should be taken out of it. A distinction between them is morally untenable. Omissions cases falling within manslaughter by recklessness or gross negligence have also been set apart from cases of positive acts. The leading modern case is Stone and Dobinson (1977), where two people were convicted of manslaughter for allowing a sick relative, whom they had permitted to live in their house, to die without medical attention. The Court of Appeal's grounds for finding a duty of care in this case are scrutinized elsewhere. Once the duty is established, the fault element required was expressed as recklessness, and defined thus: ‘a reckless disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person. Mere inadvertence is not enough. The defendant must be proved to have been indifferent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to have determined nevertheless to run it.’ This passage is rendered ambiguous by the use of the word ‘indifferent’: if that connotes failure to realize an obvious risk, the test is similar to Caldwell but probably inconsistent with the earlier assertion that ‘mere inadvertence is not enough’. If the Caldwell test of recklessness does indeed apply, then this form of omissions liability could be assimilated within the general doctrine of manslaughter by recklessness. The only difference would be that Seymour required an obvious risk of physical injury to another, whereas Stone and Dobinson required a risk of injury to health, and the difference may be more apparent than real. (e) The Contours of Manslaughter The English law of manslaughter exhibits a tension between various principles of fairness to the defendant and the significance of the harm caused. It is the resulting harm (death) which still dominates, as is evident from the fact that many forms of conduct fall within the law of manslaughter if death happens to result, whereas they would not even amount to a serious offence if a consequence less than death had ensued. Thus ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter, which can be committed by virtue of a mere assault or battery, is an example of constructive liability (see Chapter 5.2 (a) and (b)); it is only luck which makes the difference between the summary offence of common assault (maximum, six months' imprisonment) and the grave  offence of manslaughter (maximum, life imprisonment). ‘Reckless’ manslaughter is also an example of constructive liability; even if Caldwell recklessness is justifiable as a standard, it is only an obvious risk of injury which must have been foreseeable. Can these derogations from principle be justified? Reasons can only be found in the unique significance of human life and in the need to mark out, and to prevent, conduct which causes its loss. In considering whether these reasons are strong enough, we should not neglect the fact that some offences of manslaughter lie well above the lower boundaries of liability and fall little short of murder. There is no doubting the substantial culpability of the person who embarks on a course of conduct knowing that there is a risk of death to another (e.g. the man who administered chloroform in Pike ), and the person who foresees the risk of really serious harm to another from the course of conduct being pursued. The offence of murder is restricted to intent, and it would seem natural that recklessness as to the same consequences should amount to the lesser offence of manslaughter. The Criminal Law Revision Committee, which found much of the English law of manslaughter unsupportable, argued that there is a need for a homicide offence beneath murder to encompass those who cause death when reckless as to death or serious injury. But what about the lower threshold of manslaughter, where its minimum requirements form the boundary with accidental (non-criminal) homicide? Surely, to apply the label ‘manslaughter’ to the conduct of a person who envisaged no more than a common assault, e. g. by a single punch, is both disproportionate and unfair. It grossly exaggerates the amount of subjective culpability. And, viewed objectively, the risk of death from a single punch is far too remote to enter into one's reasonable contemplation. The present law attributes too much weight to chance: ‘the offender's fault falls too far short of the unlucky result. So serious an offence as manslaughter should not be a lottery.’ To support manslaughter liability in these cases one would have to espouse the draconian principle that a person should be held liable for all the consequences of any wrongful act. A refusal to espouse that principle is perhaps the only ground on which the omissions cases (see 7.5(d) above) can be defended, since their  distinction between acts and omissions is unconvincing. Different considerations press forward, however, when we move on to the various situations in which known risks ought to be guarded against: bad driving of a motor vehicle may carry an obvious risk of causing death or serious injury, as may bad navigation of a ship or an aircraft, bad driving of a train, setting fire to a residential building, and the handling of firearms. These risks are widely known, distinguished as much by the possibility of one or several deaths occurring as by the frequency with which the risk materializes. Those who deal with firearms are generally aware of the attendant risks, and the days when those involved in motoring and other forms of transport could make light of the risks to life have now long passed, as various air, sea, rail, and road disasters have occurred. In spheres of conduct such as these, where the risks are widely known, there are strong reasons for broadening the basis of criminal liability so as to encompass negligence. This still falls well short of supporting the English law of manslaughter, where the ‘unlawful act’ doctrine allows a manslaughter conviction if death results from a mere assault or battery. It also fails to substantiate the claim that death-causing acts or omissions in these situations of known danger should fall within the law of manslaughter rather than some other offence. Thus it remains for discussion whether it would not be preferable to criminalize them by means of special ‘endangerment’ offences. One advantage of that approach would be to direct attention to the particular source of danger, thus labelling the offence in a way which both describes the circumstances of the offence and serves an educative or even deterrent purpose. A possible disadvantage is that, since such offences may lack the stigma of the word ‘manslaughter’, they may tend to underplay the gravity of the behaviour involved. On the other hand, the social significance of the offences is likely to be set as much by prosecution policy and sentencing policy as by the label of the offence. These tensions behind the law of manslaughter are evident in the decisions of the courts during this century, many of which have narrowed the offence, but some of which have extended it. However, only the legislature can create new offences of endangerment. What progress has it made towards this? 7.6 ENDANGERMENT ON THE ROADS English law contains a number of offences which penalize the driving of a car on a road in a manner which may cause harm. There is the offence of driving recklessly (contrary to section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1972), and there are also the lesser offences of driving without due care and attention, and driving without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road (contrary to section 3 of the 1972 Act). Clearly, the difference between reckless driving and careless driving is one of degree. In the leading case of Lawrence (1981) it was held that reckless driving consists of driving which creates an obvious and serious risk of causing physical injury to some other person who might be happening to use the road or of doing substantial damage to property, and that the fault element is that the driver either failed to give any thought to the possibility of such a risk or, having recognized the existence of a risk, went on to take it. Many of the cases falling within this offence may involve serious fault — where there is racing on the highway, for example, or a prolonged course of very bad driving, or bad driving in order to avoid apprehension. Some less culpable forms of bad driving might also be labelled ‘reckless’, such as a momentary dozing-off at the wheel, or the failure to notice a pedestrian on a crossing. In addition to these two offences, there is a homicide offence of causing death by reckless driving (contrary to section 1 of the 1972 Act). The elements of the offence are exactly the same as for reckless driving, with the extra element of causing death. It will readily be noticed that the elements of causing death by reckless driving are virtually the same as those of ‘reckless manslaughter’: indeed, in Seymour (1983) the House of Lords held that they are the same, and the only doubt arises over the reference to ‘substantial damage to property’ in the Lawrence test. An obvious risk of property damage alone is insufficient for manslaughter, but may suffice for the driving offences. The driving offence of ‘causing death’ was first introduced in 1956, largely because juries were unwilling to convict culpable motorists of such a serious-sounding offence as manslaughter. The  position now seems to be that the two offences have the same legal definition, and that the prosecution should prefer the charge of manslaughter when the case is a bad one which might merit a sentence in excess of the five-year maximum for causing death by reckless driving. Ever since the offence of causing death by reckless driving was introduced (it formerly included causing death by dangerous driving, too), there have been those who have pointed to its ‘illogicality’. The difference between an offence of reckless driving (maximum penalty of two years) and one of causing death by reckless driving (maximum penalty of five years) may simply be one of chance. Bad driving may or may not lead to an accident, depending on the chance conjunction of other factors and other people's behaviour. And an accident may lead to death (in which case the more serious offence is committed) or merely to serious injuries or to minor damage. The response to this ‘illogicality’— which is, of course, the very problem with the law of involuntary manslaughter too — has varied in recent English proposals. Both the James Committee in 1976 and the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 recommended the abolition of the offence of causing death by reckless driving, thereby accepting the ‘illogicality’ argument. This accords with the CLRC's proposal that both ‘unlawful act’ manslaughter and reckless manslaughter should be abolished. However, the report of the Road Traffic Law Review has reversed this trend. The Review accepts the general principle that persons should be judged according to the intrinsic quality of their driving rather than its consequences, but argues that the law should depart from this in cases where death is caused and the driver's culpability is already high. This is a frank recognition of the tension created by cases where there is the supreme harm (death) combined with some culpability but no foresight of the risk of death. There is a well-known risk in motoring that certain kinds of driving may cause accidents, and that accidents may cause death. The rules of the road are designed not only to produce the orderly and unhampered movement of traffic, but also to protect property, safety, and lives. One who deviates so manifestly from these rules as to drive recklessly  ought to realize — because the driving test requires a driver to realize — that there is a considerable risk of an accident. If an accident happens as a result of driving which deviates from the proper standard, then that may well be a case of negligence even if the driver had never thought of the risk in that particular case, because the driver is presumed to know the Highway Code. It is this negligence which is termed ‘recklessness’ by the decisions in Caldwell and Lawrence . There is, however, another dimension to the debate, and this appears from the CLRC's view that, where reckless driving causes death, this should not affect the label of the offence but may be treated as an aggravating factor in sentencing in appropriate cases. This assumes that there is a tension between the causing of serious harm (death) and the relatively low fault (‘recklessness’, as here defined), and that this tension should be resolved in favour of the fault element when we are deciding on the labels of offences, thereby making no reference to the result, but should be resolved in favour of the serious harm when sentencing, increasing the sentence according to the gravity of the resulting harm. In short, we should call the offence reckless driving, but the occurrence of death, even though it may be regarded as bad luck, should aggravate the sentence. Is it defensible to have different principles for sentencing and for the labelling of offences? Much depends on the social function of labelling criminal offences, and on the particular labels chosen. We are referring here to the offence of causing death by reckless driving, not to manslaughter. It is therefore, one may assume, a label of intermediate stigma (falling short of the stigma attached to the offence of manslaughter). The fault element is fairly substantial, since the Lawrence definition refers to an obvious and serious risk of at least substantial damage to property: there will be few cases where only such damage, and no risk to personal safety, is involved; moreover, as argued above, a major reason for having rules of the road which all drivers should know is to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths resulting. Retaining the more serious label which refers to the causing of death may therefore perform a useful educative function; it is hardly unfair to the driver, since this is the very risk against which the rules are intended to guard. As for sentencing, English courts have been unclear about the proper approach. In Krawec (1984), a case of  careless driving where a death resulted, the Court of Appeal held that the proper basis for sentence is ‘the quality of driving, the extent to which the appellant on the particular occasion fell below the standard of the reasonably competent driver’, to which ‘the unforeseen and unexpected results of the carelessness’ are not relevant. However, there are other decisions which have taken account of unexpected and chance results as aggravating factors. The problem, surely, is to find a satisfactory starting-point for the level of sentences. The degree of risk created by the bad driving should be regarded as the crucial factor; it is not so much a question of whether the sentence should be more severe when the risk eventuates, as whether the sentence should be more lenient when the risk does not materialize. If the aim of the rules of the road is to protect safety, and if the driver broke those rules in a way which may be labelled ‘reckless’, then the risk has been taken and the sentence should not be affected significantly by the materialization or non-materialization of the risk. But, as a risk to safety taken recklessly, the offence deserves a penalty which places it above many intentional offences against property. The argument, then, is that the causing of death by bad driving should not be regarded as a significant aggravating factor, but nor should the non-causing of death or injury be regarded as a significant mitigating factor. The level of sentence should be set primarily, as the Lord Chief Justice stated in Krawec , according to‘the degree of carelessness and culpability’. It will therefore be seen that many of the issues involved here are similar to those raised by the law of involuntary manslaughter, save for the fact that driving offences constitute deviations from a code of conduct on which all persons are tested before they are granted driving-licences. This factor serves to distinguish driving cases from those of deaths resulting from a single punch, and also to bolster the argument that the penalties for the former should be higher than for the latter. 7.7 ENDANGERMENT IN OTHER SITUATIONS Our discussion so far has stressed the relationship between endangerment on the roads and the detailed rules of the road, including the driving test. Some preventive rules, together with  endangerment offences, can be seen in a variety of other situations, but nowhere is there such a detailed and fairly widely known set of standards as that applicable to drivers on the roads. For example, there are regulations about the storage of explosives, and the dangers of handling explosives are well known. The main thrust of the Explosives Act 1883, however, is contained in the offences of causing an explosion likely to endanger life (section 2), and the possession of explosives with intent to endanger life (section 3). The latter offence is an inchoate offence of a familiar kind: possession with intent, in circumstances where an innocent reason for possessing explosives is fairly hard to come by (unless the defendant is engaged in quarrying or another business in which explosives are used). The justification for the possession offence is preventive, and there is little difficulty in holding that a person caught in possession of explosives with intent to endanger life has sufficiently crossed the threshold of criminality to justify punishment. True, there may yet be the possibility of repentance as the time for using the explosives draws near, but the very step of taking explosives into one's Possession with this intent is culpable. As for the endangerment offence itself, two features in section 2 of the 1883 Act stand out. One is that no actual endangerment is required: the explosion need only have been inherently likely to endanger life, and the offence is committed whether or not anyone's life was put in danger. In its style of labelling, therefore, this differs from the present driving law, with its separate offences of reckless driving and causing death by reckless driving: the equivalent would be a single offence of driving in a manner likely to endanger life. The second feature of the offence of causing an explosion likely to endanger life is that there appears to be no distinct fault requirement. So long as the prosecution proves that D caused the explosion, and that the explosion was likely to endanger life, that would suffice for conviction. The reason for this must be that one can hardly cause an explosion without realizing that one is about to do so, and that explosions usually create danger and must be known to do so, unless they are carefully controlled in an area away from members of the public. However, these arguments are not particularly strong, for, if the inference of fault is so great, why not include a requirement of proof of fault, at least at the level of subjective recklessness? Further offences of endangerment may be found in the Firearms  Act 1968. Section 16 contains an offence of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, which corresponds to the offence under section 3 of the Explosives Act. Again, the circumstances of the possession are likely to raise an inference of intent, unless the possession was clearly connected with some authorised shooting activity. There are then three possession offences of a slightly different type. Section 18 penalizes the possession of a firearm with intent to commit a crime or to resist arrest: this is a more specific variation of section 16, catering for the defence that the firearm was being carried for use in a robbery but with no intention that it would actually be used to endanger anyone, only to frighten — that would be a section 18 offence. Section 19 penalises possession of a loaded firearm in a public place, presumably in circumstances where the section 16 offence cannot be proved, but on the argument that the mere possession is sufficiently dangerous because accidents can happen with loaded guns, and the consequences might be life-endangering. Section 20 penalizes possession of a firearm when trespassing: again, there might be a defence to a section 16 charge if D was merely intending to shoot animals or fowl, but the gun could be turned on a human being and therefore represents a source of danger. What these firearms offences appear to amount to is a criminalization of the carrying of firearms in all but the most innocent of contexts. If the firearm is discharged and property is damaged, then an offence of criminal damage may be charged. If it is discharged and a person is injured or killed, the appropriate offence against the person can be charged. What the Firearms Act provides is a series of inchoate or preventive offences which criminalize conduct even before it has reached the stage of an attempt to commit some substantive offence. The offences do not require any endangerment at all: that is taken to be inherent in the carrying of firearms, since their potentialities are grave and the risk of accidents as well as deliberate use is well known. Offences relating to the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways have not been prominent in the practice of English criminal law. But the law does contain such offences, and it is more a matter of prosecutors making little use of them. It is true that over the years a few railway signalmen have been convicted of manslaughter for wrongful acts and omissions leading to fatal train crashes, but there is not the natural resort to the criminal law which is now a feature of road-traffic cases. In a sense, greater values are at stake in the operation of aircraft, ships, and railways, because many lives are  involved, more than would normally be risked by the bad driving of a motor vehicle (although there is an important exception here in the operation of buses and coaches, which are more akin to planes, boats, and trains). But there is another significant difference between the individual driving a car or a lorry and all these other forms of transport, and that is the chain of responsibility. A company's management policies might be just as much to blame for a particular ‘accident’ as the actions of the driver, pilot, or captain: Sheen J made this point in his report on the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, but English prosecution practice has tended not to invoke the criminal law against managers of transport systems. One reason for this may be the doctrine of corporate liability in English criminal law (discussed in Chapter 4.3, and found to be unsatisfactory); in particular, it may be difficult to establish the fault necessary for manslaughter, although easier to secure a conviction under legislation on railways or merchant shipping. There may also be a reluctance among prosecutors to look beyond the individual driver, pilot, or captain in each case. It is not just the operation of systems of transport which is a source of endangerment: the actions of individuals may be designed to take advantage of the possibility of causing several deaths at once. The longest determinate prison sentence ever upheld by English courts was the sentence of forty-five years' imprisonment in the case of Hindawi (1988), a man who sent his pregnant girlfriend on a flight with a bag which contained a bomb timed to destroy the aircraft and its 350 passengers in mid-flight. The offence in this was ‘an attempt to place on an aircraft a device likely to destroy or damage the aircraft, contrary to the Aviation Security Act 1982’— an inchoate offence, and one worded without any express reference to the endangerment of lives. The sentence, however, was intended to reflect the attempt to kill so many people. Injuries and deaths at work are a significant and reducible source of danger to the citizen, and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 provides the framework for the regulation of safety in work-places with an offence of failing to ensure that, ‘so far as is reasonably practicable’, employees are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. Other fragmentary legislation is to be found in recent years, e.g. the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. However, in addition to all these specific offences of endangerment, English law does contain one fairly wide-ranging offence, and that is the aggravated offence of criminal damage. Under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 it is an offence — punishable with life imprisonment — to damage property ‘intending by the destruction or damage to endanger the life of another or being reckless whether the life of another would be thereby endangered’. Criminal damage itself is an offence carrying up to ten years' imprisonment, but this is a more serious offence — more of an offence against the person. One might well ask how important the element of criminal damage is to the rationale of the aggravated offence. One answer could be that, where the damage is caused by fire, the consequent danger to life may be similar to that created by an explosion, and the inferences may be the same: who could cause such a fire in such a place without appreciating the danger to others? However, the major question raised by section I(2) of the Criminal Damage Act is why English law does not have a general offence of endangerment. Why should the fact that D was engaged on causing damage to property at the time (even damage to D's own property) make his conduct into an offence punishable with life imprisonment when, if D were engaged on some other activity, it would not be punishable as such and would only amount to manslaughter if a death happened to be caused? Section 211.2 of the Model Penal Code has been enacted into the laws of many American states, providing a general endangerment offence. The offence is committed where a person recklessly engages in conduct which places another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury. It does not require any result, although it does require actual danger. Its great merit is that it is not confined to particular activities, and therefore has an across-the-board application to different sources of endangerment. On the other hand, such a general offence does not fulfil the educative function of singling out situations which carry a particular risk of danger. For that reason, it would be wise to retain a special offence for road-traffic cases, and there may be merit in retaining offences with particular labels in other spheres. What is more pertinent is whether the different styles of the offences discussed above have some justification. Should the fault standard require D's actual awareness, or merely an objective probability of danger? Should there be proof of actual danger to someone, or is potential danger enough?"
ACA ACA-B2K-002 4.14 "THE SZEKERES CLASS OF VACUUM SOLUTIONS The first exact solution to be published which describes a collision between plane waves was in fact that of Szekeres (1970). This describes the collision of plane gravitational waves with step wavefronts. The solution discussed in Chapter 3, which describes the collision between impulsive gravitational waves, was published a little later by Khan and Penrose (1971). Following this, a substantial paper in which the subject is analysed in detail was produced by Szekeres (1972). This paper includes a derivation of the field equations in the form given in Chapter 6, a general class of exact solutions which includes the two mentioned above as special cases, and a discussion of the singularities that arise. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the properties of this general class of solutions. The solution in region IV The vacuum field equations appropriate to region IV of the colliding plane wave problem may be taken here in the form of equations (6.22a-f). These are second order differential equations for the four metric functions . Equation (6.22a) may immediately be integrated as in (6.24) to give  (9.1) where  and  are arbitrary decreasing functions which, according to the appropriate boundary conditions (7.3), are required to satisfy  and . In the Szekeres class of solutions, the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization. In these solutions therefore  (9.2) and the main equations (6.22d, e) reduce to the single equation  (9.3) For this, Szekeres has obtained the solution  (9.4) which contains two arbitrary constants k 1 and k 2 . The expression (9.4) may also be written in the alternative form  (9.5) With this expression for V , the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (9.6) where c is a constant. As anticipated in the discussion in Section 7.2, it may be observed that this expression contains the necessary multiples of  and  that are required to cancel the effects of the unbounded term on the boundary. If the leading terms in the expansions for f and g are  (9.7) where , then e -M is continuous across the boundaries if ,(9.8) It may thus be observed that the constants k 1 and k 2 are restricted to the range satisfying  (9.9) It is also appropriate to choose  (9.10) to achieve the usual flat metric (3.6) in region I. When evaluating the components of the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to introduce the new function  (9.11) With this, it can be seen that  (9.12) and the non-zero Weyl tensor components are . (9.13) In his paper, Szekeres chooses  and  (9.14) exactly. In this case, the terms  and  in (9.6) exactly cancel the term , and M is given by  (9.15) This form is still completely general since it has, in effect, simply used the coordinate freedom (6.7). However, it is sometimes convenient to retain this freedom, so this restriction will not be made in the following section. It may now be pointed out that, with the restriction (9.14), the above solution includes the Khan-Penrose (1971) solution for colliding impulsive waves when . It also includes the Szekeres (1970) solution for colliding step waves when . The approaching waves Having obtained an exact solution in region IV, the question now is to find the initial conditions which give rise to it. In fact, it is quite simple to use the method described in Section 7.2 to extend any solution in region IV back into regions II, III and I. We obtain the corresponding solutions in regions II and III simply by replacing g by ½ and f by ½ alternately. In this section we will concentrate on region II, and put . The equivalent solution in region III can be obtained from this by replacing f by g , and by interchanging u and v . Using the suggested method, it can be seen that the solution in region II must have the line element  (9.16) where, retaining the coordinate freedom in u ,(9.17) In order to interpret this solution as a plane wave, it is appropriate to transform the metric to the Brinkmann form  (9.18) by putting  (9.19) The wave profile in equation (9.18) now takes either of the forms  (9.20) or  (9.21) Particular cases in which  and  are illustrated in Figure 9.1 for . Figure 9. l Some wave profiles for the approaching waves in the Szekeres solution with . The wavefront is unbounded if . It contains a step if , and is smooth if . All profiles become unbounded as u approaches 1. It may be recalled from (4.5) that . Thus, it can be clearly seen that the approaching gravitational wave in region II is an impulsive wave if , has an unbounded wavefront if , has a step wavefront if , has a continuous wavefront if , and has a smooth wavefront if . It may also be observed that, if , is monotonically increasing. The singularity structure In this family of solutions, there is always a scalar polynomial curvature singularity in region IV on the surface on which . This can be seen by computing the scalar invariant given here by  (9.22) Using (9.6) and (9.13), I can be seen to be unbounded when  for all values of k 1 and k 2 in the required range (9.9). This is similar to the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution which, of course, it includes as a special case. Another singularity occurs in cases in which a wave with an unbounded wave front moves in a region where the opposing wave is non-zero. For example, if  and  so that then I is unbounded on the boundary  between regions III and IV. Similarly, the boundary  is singular if  and  so that Apart from cases containing impulsive waves, where  or , the boundaries of region IV are therefore only regular if  for , which implies the further restriction  on (9.9). These singularities, however, are distribution-valued and their physical significance requires further investigation. The coordinate singularities in regions II and III, however, are not so obviously similar to the fold singularities of the Khan-Penrose solution. The Szekeres solutions are only flat behind the wave front in the special case when . In the general case, regions II and III are curved and the analysis given in Section 8.2 cannot be applied. However, we may notice that in all cases with , 4 becomes unbounded as  in region II. This clearly indicates that, in these cases, the singularity in this region is a non-scalar curvature singularity. This has been confirmed in rigorous calculations by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). It has also been argued in the previous chapter that these singularities have similar properties to the fold singularities that occur for colliding impulsive waves as described in Section 8.2 in terms of the behaviour of neighbouring geodesics. A similar non-scalar curvature singularity also occurs in region III if , as  then becomes unbounded as ."
ACA ACA-CMA-007 3.29 "EVOLUTION, ETHICS, AND THE REPRESENTATION PROBLEM BERNARD WILLIAMS This paper is concerned with culture and with evolution, but not with cultural evolution. It discusses the relations between biological evolution and the areas of human culture which may broadly be called ‘ethical’. The concept of cultural evolution is problematical, and there are notorious difficulties about applying the notions of evolution and natural selection to cultural development; in particular, the ends served by various cultural developments are themselves defined by culture, as are the ‘choices’ to which Wilson refers in his paper (this volume). That area, however, is not the concern of the present discussion. There are two kinds of connection between evolutionary theory and ethics: one normative, and one explanatory. There is also a connection between these two, to which I shall come later. The first of these is older than the second, and has acquired a bad name; indeed, it acquired it fairly early, in some part from the monumental and unappealing system of Herbert Spencer. In fact, as John Burrow has shown (Burrow, 1966) a lot of this material ante-dated The Origin of Species ; the concept of ‘the survival of the fittest’(Spencer's own phrase) was already implicit in earlier sociological work which Spencer derived from Malthus. Darwin himself had little sympathy for these ideas and not much, personally, for Spencer, though he did once say — I quote Burrow (p. 182)—‘in a moment of enthusiasm…that Spencer's Principles of Biology made him feel that he ‘is about a dozen times my superior’, and thought that Spencer might one day be regarded as the equal of Descartes and Leibniz, rather spoiling the effect by adding, ‘about whom, however, I know very little’’. The bad normative applications of evolutionary theory to ethics which were made by Spencer and others also, of course, involved a lot of bad evolutionary theory: if normative lessons could be drawn from Darwinian  theory, there is certainly no reason why they should take the form suggested by Social Darwinists. However, there is in addition a standard objection which holds that no such lessons can be drawn at all, at least in any directly logical way, since any project of deriving ethical content from premisses of evolutionary theory commits the ‘naturalistic fallacy’, an error which is today often equated with that of trying to derive ought from is . Interesting questions about ‘naturalism’ in ethics in fact go beyond these purely logical issues. Naturalism in a broader sense consists in the attempt to lay down certain fundamental aspects of the good life for man on the basis of considerations of human nature. If this project falls, it is not for purely logical reasons; it will rather be for the more interesting reason that the right sort of truths do not exist about human nature. I shall come back to this wider question at the end of this paper. The point about ought and is , so far as it goes, does have some force. It can be put in the following way. Suppose that considerations of evolutionary theory show that certain behaviour is in some sense appropriate for human beings. Either human beings can diverge from this pattern, or they cannot. If they can, then the biological considerations are not going to show that they ought not to; while, if they cannot so diverge, then there is no question of ought . This argument seems to me sound so far as it goes, but it does not go very far. Implicit in this last argument is another logical relation which is more interesting for this question than that between ought and is : the relation, that is to say, between ought and can . This relationship underlies some important negative arguments which by citing certain claims to the effect that human beings cannot, as they may suppose, live in a certain way, lead to the conclusion that certain ethical goals or ideals are unrealistic and should be revised. By arguments of this kind, biological or similar arguments could coherently yield constraints on social goals, personal ideals, possible institutions and so forth. To say that human beings cannot do certain things is, of course, an extremely vague form of statement. At one extreme, it may mean that the world will not contain an example of any single human being doing that thing; at the other end, it may merely mean that if a group of human beings  adopt a norm requiring that behaviour, the norm will often be broken, its observance will give rise to a good deal of anxiety, those who comply without anxiety to the norm will be unusual in other respects, and so forth. This vagueness will not matter so long as one is clear about the level at which the formula of ‘ought implies can ’ is being applied: thus the latter, and weaker, kind of‘cannot’would be enough to provide a strong argument against the behaviour being made into a norm for a human society, but it would not be enough if the question concerned the adoption of a personal ideal in an individual case. Here, as so often, it is a centrally important question, who is supposedly being addressed by a given piece of ethical discourse. Granted that one is clear about that, the fact that relevant statements of what human beings can and cannot do come in various strengths is not so important. What is vitally important is the difficulty of knowing which of them, relevant to difficult ethical issues, are on biological grounds in fact true. In this area there is an important connection, which I mentioned before, between what I called the normative and the explanatory interest. If some biological constraint can rule out, or make unrealistic, some normative practice or institution, then knowledge of it may not only encourage us to decline that practice if it is suggested, but may also contribute an explanation of why human communities do not in general display that practice or institution. Might biological considerations then go further and explain the human adoption of other practices, which are conformable to biological constraints? This raises a general question which is central to these areas, and which I shall call the representation problem . It is a problem which comes up at various points in considering the relations between biology and human practices, and may be put in the following way:how is a phenotypic character which would present itself in other species as a behavioural tendency represented in a species which has a culture, language and conceptual thought ? It may be said that in some cases, at least, such a tendency will show up in that species merely as itself — that is to say , as a merely biological character of that species. But, in fact, virtually no behavioural tendency which constitutes genuine action can just show up in a cultural context ‘as itself’. Where there is culture, it affects everything, and we should reject the crude view that culture is applied to an animal in a way which leaves its other characteristics unmodified. (Related to that view is the naive assumption of certain sociobiologists that sociobiology should expect to be more closely related to social anthropology than to other social sciences, because the ‘primitive’ peoples studied by social anthropology are nearer to nature than  human beings who live in large industrialized societies.) None of this is to deny that there is a biological basis for elements in human behaviour which are culturally affected, moulded and elaborated. It is not to deny that some culturally elaborated behaviour can usefully be explained from a biological perspective. It is simply to recall the fact that almost all human behaviour, at least that which deserves the name of ‘action’, is in fact culturally moulded and elaborated. In accepting that there is a representation problem, I reject two views according to which there would be no such problem. First is a simple reductionist view, which would neglect the way in which culture not only shapes but constitutes the vast mass of human behaviour. When ancient Greek thought first discovered the opposition of ‘nature’ and ‘convention’, it also discovered that an essential part of human nature is to live by convention. The study of human nature is , in good part, the study of human conventions, and that is what it is from the strictest ethological point of view. That is how this species is. It is a claim additional to this, but one which I also believe to be true, that human conventions, at least beyond a certain state of elaboration, can be understood only with the help of history, and that the social sciences accordingly have an essential historical base. To pursue the question of whether that is so, would go beyond the limits of the present discussion, but it is worth bearing in mind, when the relations are discussed of biology to the social sciences, that an essential social science is likely to prove to be history. The second point of view which is excluded by taking seriously the representation problem is one which I am disposed, perhaps unfairly, to call ‘the Wittgensteinian cop-out’. This is a view implicit in the idea that the central concept for gaining insight into human activities is that of a ‘language game’. Since ‘language’ in this formulation is regarded both as the key to human convention, and also as something which human beings possess and animals do not, the phrase itself implies the lack of interesting explanatory or constraining connections between human and animal behaviour. It suggests an autonomy of the human, under a defining idea of linguistic and conceptual consciousness, which tends to put a stop to any interesting questions of the biological kind before they even start. It therefore does not give any help even in the areas, such as sex and hunger, where we most obviously need means of describing the relations between culture and the biological. The feature of human culture and human activities that gives rise to the representation problem is above all that human communities embody norms , and it is this notion that I shall principally discuss. However, there  are other ways, as well, of picking out differences between human activities and those of other animals. One is the very general feature that humans possess conceptual and reflexive consciousness; this, and the very large philosophical problems introduced by those three terms, I shall happily leave on one side. Another distinction between human and animal behaviour is that considerations of motive are appropriate to the assessment of human action. This is a matter that is worth some brief discussion, since it is closely connected with the fuss that has been made about the application of the term ‘altruism’ to animal as to human behaviour. In other animals there is behaviour which benefits another individual, and moreover there is behaviour the end of which is to benefit another individual, in a sense of ‘end’ which requires a lot of work to make clear, but which is uncontentiously illustrated by behaviour the end of which is that the animal should take in food. In the human case, many more layers can be added, and other distinctions drawn. There are questions of intention, where this concerns what thoughts produce the action, and what features of the action are, relative to that thought, accidental. There are questions of underlying desire. Some actions which benefit others come from the desire just to benefit that particular person, while others flow from some more general disposition, while the desire to benefit a particular person or group may be accompanied by a variety of other desires, for instance to extract goodwill from them, or the possibility of a reward. The cultural and psychological elaboration of these various motives of course raises difficulties for any simple relation of them to the biological. Some of those difficulties arise just from the general problem of applying biological models to a species which engages in intentional thought; to that extent there is no special problem about altruism and morality. People think that there is a special barrier here to the application of biological models, I believe, because they take ‘altruism’, in a ‘properly moral’ sense, to refer to some quite peculiarly pure motive, such as the intention to benefit others derived from impartial reflection on their interests and associated with no other desire whatsoever. But it is extremely unreasonable to suppose that all (perhaps any) human beings act from that motivation, either, and if morality is to be a generally human phenomenon, it is simply a mistake to equate it from the beginning with such exigently Kantian formulations, and it is a mistake even from the point of view of the human sciences. It is no doubt true that a biological perspective will make one more suspicious of extremely intellectualist or, again, very purist views of morality; but equally, so will a reasonable historical and psychological understanding of morality. It is the notion of a norm that perhaps gives rise to the central representation problem. The main point is condensed in the question raised by Pat Bateson in his paper (this volume), about the relation between an inhibition and a prohibition. The most, it seems, that a genetically acquired character could yield would be an inhibition against behaviours of a certain kind; what relation could that have to a socially sanctioned prohibition? Indeed, if the inhibition exists, what need could there be for such a prohibition? If the prohibitory norm is to be part of the ‘extended phenotype’ of the species, how could we conceive, starting from an inhibition, that this should come about? This is a central example of the problem, but it is not the only example even with respect to norms, and it will be helpful to distinguish various things that fall under the general heading of a ‘norm’. Not everything that falls under this heading is a sanctioned prohibition. We can distinguish various items; I will represent them as stacked , in a way which is typical, but not by any means universal. (1) Behaviour which is normal. This does not just mean ‘frequent’: exceptions are perceived as ‘odd’, but are not necessarily disapproved of, sanctioned, etc. (2) (1) together with an institution. This can be applied to the case of marriage, where there will of course be usually sanctions of varying degrees against behaviours that threaten marriage, and sexual activity outside marriage may be disapproved of, but this does not imply that merely not engaging in marriage is disapproved of, nor that an unmarried condition is sanctioned. (3) Behaviour which lies outside (1) and (2), and to which in addition there may be strong personal disinclination: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in enlightened circles. (4) (3) together with rejection and disapproval of the deviant behaviour: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in less enlightened circles. (5) (4) together with sanctions personal or legal: e.g. homosexuality in the least enlightened circles. Among the cases in which the options are not stacked like this, is that in which the sanctions and disapproval exist against behaviour which is in fact frequent and not the subject, perhaps, of any deep personal disinclination; this, at the limit, is pure humbug, like the old school-master's attitude to masturbation. (1) to (3) of course raise some difficulties for a biological approach, particularly with regard to institutions, and an adequate treatment of the representation problem will deal with all these levels. The question of  inhibitions and prohibitions arises most clearly at levels (4) and (5). There is, moreover, a specially paradoxical version of it which arises from certain cases in which not only does extra conceptual content have to be introduced to characterize the human prohibition, but also the introduction of that content stands in conflict with the proposed biological explanation of it. A clear example of this arises with the famous example of the incest taboo, which has been discussed by Bateson (this volume). There are of course many incest taboos, that is to say, prohibitions on sexual relations between persons of various degrees of familial relation, and some of these are hardly even candidates for biological explanation. Moreover, there may well be some very severe doubts about the application of the biological model even to the favourite cases. The present discussion, is not, however, concerned with the factual merits of these explanations, but only with the shape that they take. In other species, there are behavioural drives the function of which is to avoid inbreeding. Such a drive, however, has to be operationalized in some other way, since the animals do not have any direct knowledge of the matters relevant to inbreeding: the inhibition against mating has to be triggered by the recognition of or reaction to some property adequately correlated with the kin relationship, such as being an individual with which the animal has been brought up. It is this inhibition that is allegedly displayed, in the well-known case, by those brought up in the kibbutz. But we have not yet reached any incest taboo. There are no sanctions against marrying those that one is brought up with (as such); the sanction is against marriages which would constitute close in-breeding. The conceptual content of the prohibition is thus different from the content that occurs in the description of the inhibition. It indeed relates to the suggested function of that inhibition, but that fact will not explain how the prohibition which is explicitly against in-breeding will have arisen. It certainly does not represent a mere ‘raising to consciousness’ of the inhibition. It can have come about, in fact, only given human knowledge of relevant facts — presumably, of the ill-effects of in-breeding. But once that is an essential step in the explanation, we no longer need the biological element in the explanation (of the prohibition, that is to say, rather than of the inhibition). It turns out that we have to appeal in any case to something like a rational collective agency, directed towards avoiding recognized and agreed evils, and that already provides an adequate explanation — a fairly traditional one — of the incest prohibition. A similar paradox can arise with other norms supposedly based at a biological level, but there are cases that avoid it. Consider for instance the  ‘double standard’ in sexual morality, traced by Symons (1979) to the disparity between ovum and sperm. This account, though it applies much more widely, is essentially the same as an explanation of these social phenomena which goes back at least to Hume, who accounted for ‘the artificial virtues of chastity and modesty in women’ by referring to the naturally greater disposition of males to protect children that they believe to be their own. Here again, there may be serious doubts about relevant anthropological facts, but the present point concerns the principle of the explanation, which involves an important difference from the incest case. Here, it is natural to think in terms of the institutionalization of a disposition which could be displayed in a simpler form pre-culturally. The conceptual content required in this case to describe the institution, though it involves a great deal of cultural elaboration, does not display the same kind of break between the pre-cultural and the cultural as is found in the incest case; and the biological pattern of explanation could recognizably run through such ideas as human beings finding certain institutions ‘natural’, which does not require any appeal to a rational collective agency to understand the basic biological idea, as is damagingly the case with the incest example. In fact, an explanation which went back to a biologically grounded disposition could in this case precisely avoid the invocation of rational collective agency, which is rather an intellectualist embarrassment to the story as Hume (1738–40) tells it. None of this implies that even if such biological elements did play some role in explaining these institutions, the institutions would then be necessary or unchangeable — even if the explanation were true, this could still be a case in which becoming conscious of their rationale was a help in changing them. In one of the two cases we have considered — incest — the prohibition is paradoxically related to pre-cultural dispositions: it expresses their function, but not their content. In the case just considered, social institutions could in principle be an expression of a pre-cultural disposition. In other cases, again, the existence of norms seems to be a substitute for a pre-cultural disposition. This might well be so with the control of aggression and of self-seeking behaviour; I shall make one or two remarks about this question without pursuing it at length. In the work of Maynard Smith and others (see, for example, Maynard Smith, this volume) games theory is applied to explaining selection for certain genetically based patterns of behaviour. Games theory can equally be applied to characterizing human norms which are instituted against aggression and other non-cooperative behaviour. (Ullmann-Margalit (1977) gives a recent analysis, though the outlines of the idea that  sanctioned norms can represent a solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma can be found in Hobbes.) The principles of the two applications of games theory are in many ways the same but their results point, in a sense, in opposite directions. If sanctioned norms are necessary in the human case, or socialization into rule-observing behaviour, this must be because constraints on human responses in these areas are not, or not significantly, genetically based. Granted structures of the Prisoners' Dilemma type, cooperative behaviour can be secured only granted a certain level of assurance, and the need of norms (in particular of sanctioned norms) to produce that assurance shows that the assurance cannot be adequately delivered by genetically based signals. It is very tempting to suppose that the lack of any such reliable signals, and the perilously low level of security often reached in human communities, must be connected with a high level of conceptual and, in particular, predictive thought, and also an associated capacity for deceit. This perhaps gives a special force to the Voltairean remark about the function of language being to conceal thought. The previous remarks have raised some questions about the relations between human norms and possible underlying dispositions determined at a biological level. They represent some aspects of what I have called the representation problem, and it is only through further investigation of that problem, and by becoming clearer about how the various kinds of norm could relate to our biological inheritance, that we can come to see much about what biological constraints there might be, beyond the obvious ones, on social and ethical arrangements. I do not believe it to be excluded a priori that there could be some, and I do not believe that very much is to be achieved by very general assertions or denials of the possibility. What is needed is more detailed analysis, not only anthropological but philosophical, of the demands that any explanations of this sort would have to meet. It will be needed, above all, if we are to be able to read the historical record. It is only if we can read that record that we can discover some very important biological characteristics of human beings, since (to repeat an earlier point) it is through convention, convention that has a history, that human nature is expressed. It is not merely that without a hold on the representation problem we cannot discover the relevant content in the historical record; without understanding that problem, we cannot adequately control the idea that there is any relevant content at all. If a biologically grounded disposition showed up simply in the form of what human beings could not or would not do, then there would be no real problem of alternative behaviours. The alternatives will simply be absent from the record, and it is unlikely that anyone, except as the most extreme  perversity, would want to undertake them. This, of course, is the area in which the is/ought argument scores its clear but uninteresting success. What is much more interesting, I have already suggested, is the idea that there could be patterns of behaviour which human beings are entirely capable of wanting and indeed, on an individual or limited scale, of achieving, but which for biological reasons are bound to be psychologically costly, or confined to a small group of otherwise unusual individuals, or otherwise bound to fail as general social institutions. To understand how this could be involves some understanding of the representation problem, and to decide that any given pattern of behaviour has this character of being, as one might put it, ‘biologically discouraged’ requires one to be able to read the historical record. It hardly needs emphasizing that on any question that is interesting, such as social roles of the sexes, we would have to be able to read the historical record better than we now can in order to arrive at any strong conclusions about what is biologically discouraged. I come back finally to what I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter as the area of ‘naturalism’ more broadly conceived: that is to say, the question of founding human ethics on considerations of human nature, in some way which goes beyond merely respecting the limits, biological or other, on what human beings are able to do. This is the project of thinking out, from what human beings are like, how they might best and most appropriately live. Such a project continues to attract some philosophers. Its attractions are obvious. It does not, in any obvious way, require any supernatural warrant, while it is less arbitrary or relativistic than other secular ways of looking at the content of morality. It seems to offer some promise of being both well-founded and contentful. It seems to me that a correct understanding of human evolution is very relevant to projects of this kind, but that the effect of that understanding is largely discouraging to them. This is for two different kinds of reason. The first is a reason at a more particular and factual level and is correspondingly more sensitive than the other to changes in hypotheses about the emergence of human beings. It is simply that the most plausible stories now available about that evolution, including its very recent date and also certain considerations about the physical characteristics of the species, suggests that human beings are to some degree a mess, and that the rapid and immense development of symbolic and cultural capacities has left man as a being for which no form of life is likely to prove entirely satisfactory, either individually or socially. Many of course have come to that conclusion before, and those who have tried to reach a naturalistic  morality which transcends it have had to read the historical record, or read beyond the historical record, in ways which seek to reveal a partly hidden human nature which is waiting to be realized or perfected. The evolutionary story, to the extent that it can now be understood (and to the much more modest extent to which I understand it myself) seems to me to give some support to the view that in this respect the historical story means very much what it seems to mean. The second and more general reason lies not in the particular ways in which human beings may have evolved, but simply in the fact that they have evolved, and by natural selection. The idea of a naturalistic ethics was born of a deeply teleological outlook, and its best expression, in many ways, is still to be found in Aristotle's philosophy, a philosophy according to which there is inherent in each natural kind of thing an appropriate way for things of that kind to behave. On that view it must be man's deepest desire — need?— purpose?— satisfaction?— to live in the way that is in this objective sense appropriate to him (the fact that modern words break up into these alternatives expresses the modern break-up of Aristotle's view). Other naturalistic views, Marxist and some which indeed call themselves ‘evolutionary’, have often proclaimed themselves free from any such picture, but it is basically very hard for them to avoid some appeal to an implicit teleology, an order in relation to which there would be an existence that would satisfy all the most basic human needs at once. The first and hardest lesson of Darwinism, that there is no such teleology at all, and that there is no orchestral score provided from anywhere according to which human beings have a special part to play, still has to find its way fully into ethical thought."
ACA ACA-ECV-005 4.95 "5 The Philosopher's Child Judith Hughes SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING Children have served philosophy very well. That is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice. Along with a selection from a list including women, animals, madmen, foreigners, slaves, patients and imbeciles, children have served in that great class of beings, the ‘not-men’, in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves. Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention. They have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood. Generations of philosophers have documented this process. Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come. Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood, boyhood and youth. That is the second thing to notice; the philosopher's children are boys. The fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, no doubt, the reasons for this were largely social. But the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice, though many might think this real and bad enough. Education has an end. Although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘for its own sake’, what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be. Where the end is  person- rather than role-oriented — that is, where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of, say, information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve. Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them. The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter. Education has been directed at the production of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, in short, the autonomous human being. Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species. Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all. The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others. It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy. Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction. This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself. It is also about children. WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children? There are, of course, the familiar and obvious reasons  connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too. When philosophers dismiss women as ‘not-men’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics. Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep. It would be well to know just what this entails. Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like. A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women, they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality, capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics. We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous? Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive. It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children. Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience? What is it to be treated as a child? Women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves. It is no accident that the liberation of women, such as it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general; liberation for one part of the ‘not-men’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you. The assumption that all groups in the ‘not-men’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children. ‘That's what they used to say about women’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false. But it should make us very suspicious. That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all, but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill's famous disclaimer in his essay On Liberty . Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection, Mill (1910) asserts: this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the  maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. (p.73) This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings. The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational. If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children. I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place. Partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘children’ covers such a wide range of potential images, I shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society. She is the child of this paper unless I indicate otherwise. Throughout we should ask ourselves, does this (whatever is being said) apply to her ? First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past. One thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults; in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have. NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18…. the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty; the woman has but its authority is imperfect; so has the child, but in this case it is immature. (Aristotle, 1959,1260A) Children…are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained the use of speech but are called Reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. (Hobbes, 1914, p. 21) [Children]…love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined…[by which]… I mean, that you should  make them sensible by the Mildness of your carriage, and the composure even in your correction of them, that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them. (Locke, 1968, p. 181) In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done. Young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are, or they get puzzled and ask question after question. But as we approach the age of youth reason appears. At what age ought the education for youth to begin? Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect… The youth…is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement. (Kant, 1930, pp. 250–1) If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences. (Mill, 1910, p. 139) What are the philosophers' children like? They have an ‘immature’ deliberative faculty (Aristotle), are not ‘endued with Reason’(Hobbes), until roughly the age of 10 (Kant) and are ‘incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives’(Mill). But they are not completely lost causes. The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the ‘possibility apparent’ of turning into rational beings (Hobbes); they love to be treated as though they were rational though they are not so yet (Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles (Kant). Until the time when these things happen then Mill's disclaimer comes into operation. Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions. The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; that is, on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals. It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both. In either case, the political implication is that denying rights  to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests. In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection. Beyond that, the similarities seem remote. There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle. Apart from being false, such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states. The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational, non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill. Children, according to Hobbes, have the ‘possibility apparent’ of becoming reasonable. In what does the possibility consist? Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the ‘possibility apparent’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones. But what? Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have. It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child. Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others. But then, either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘intelligently’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals. In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it. Locke's remarks are just as puzzling. Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were. How is this possible? Apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is. Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice? Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes; I must at least say something. Is it just that I talk to them that they love? Maybe, but I can also, if I like, talk to my car, but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational. Lockean children have the added  amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves, while Kantian kids, two stages back from rationality, have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions. Mill's minors are a little more complicated. Part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree. But in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions. Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene. All in all, it is a pretty unconvincing picture. If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are. If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults. Hobbes et al . are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why, often in the same sentence, they produce these contradictions. The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery. ILLEGITIMATE INFERENCES The recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot, therefore, be denied it on any account. We should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left, the pederast lobby or children themselves. It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought. In Escape from Childhood (1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be. He sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children's needs, and an oppressive invention at that. He suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote, to manage their own financial affairs, to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and  to make and enter into, on a basis of mutual consent, quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms. Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience. He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years, and remarks: We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add. Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible? (Harris, 1982, p. 49) Now Holt and Harris both have many wise, enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children, but as these remarks show, putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter. Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions. What, we may ask Holt, happens to the child who, dissatisfied at home, seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him? What if no one wants him? Our papers are currently full of ‘hard-to-place’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents. In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others. What, we may ask Harris, happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination? To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination. He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults. These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise. In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here. Suppose Holt's 6-year-old does opt out of school? What happens to her then? What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her? Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead? However much she may enjoy such pursuits, there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied. Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her, who will? His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide. Holt's child is actually the Artful Dodger; mercifully, not all children are. There are other difficulties too. It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to, but Holt clearly does not. He proposes that ‘the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them’(Holt, 1974, p. 15). If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children, then he is mistaken. The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them. He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties, but he cannot forgo them. They are not just available to him, they are his. That is what being a citizen involves. Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children. Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them. But the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities. Failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral; failure to carry out one's duties is not. It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens. Children still would not have full political status. Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen; they are an integral part of being a citizen. Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities  and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark: I do not say, either, that these rights and duties should be tied into one package, that if a young person wants to assume any of them, he must assume them all. He should be able to pick and choose. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) If he can ‘pick and choose’, I suggest, he is not a citizen, he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option. Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem. They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all. Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness. WHEN IN DOUBT, GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense. That it is firmly tied must be correct; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information. Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it. Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the Politics which I quoted earlier; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority. What did he mean? What he did not mean is that women lack rationality; they can and do deliberate. At first sight what he seems to be saying is simply that no one is going to take any notice of the conclusions which a rational woman reaches after deliberation. On further reflection, I think this is exactly what he is saying, and its significance is immense. His  view is that the judgements which women make have no standing. Keeping to the domestic front for the moment, what this means is that the conclusions which women reach, no matter how carefully and intelligently they are worked out, can never have the status of decisions. You cannot decide, though you may desire, to divorce your husband if the law does not allow; you cannot order the wine if only his signature makes the order legitimate. And your inability to decide or to order has nothing to do with your mental powers. But Aristotle is not just making a sociological point about what is and is not permitted to women in his society. His remark goes deeper than that. It refers not to power but to authority, and what I think he means is that although a woman can make good and wise judgements, she cannot be the arbiter of that goodness or wisdom. For that she needs the ratification of men, and that is enough to conclude that her judgements lack authority. Now that is quite different from saying that women always make bad judgements, that is to say, that they suffer from some deficiency of rationality. Aristotle only produces spurious suggestions about a woman's incapacity to think or to stick to principles when he is obliged to say something about why their judgements lack authority. It then looks as though the argument runs: (1) Women lack some moral or cognitive capacity therefore (2) Women (must) lack authority. In truth this version is the argument on its head; its real form is: (1) Women lack authority therefore (2) Women (must) lack some moral or cognitive capacity. The important point here is that Aristotle's women are not autonomous, not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority; that is, their right to make decisions, to speak for themselves is not acknowledged. This acknowledgement is absolutely essential, for without it no mental act which they perform, however well, will count as a decision at all. The point I am making here is based on an observation by Stanley Cavell (1979, p. 460) and repeated by him in many contexts: ‘a human being could not fail to know, confronting me, that I am a human being’. Why not? Because to see someone is to see them as a human being and to see them as a human being is to acknowledge them as such. This acknowledgement is not derived from a prior knowledge of facts, rather it is a precondition of there being any  facts. We do not, on the Cavell model, first discover certain truths about an object and then conclude that it is a person; we first acknowledge the person and only inquire into facts later if necessary. The point was put graphically by my colleague, Ian Ground. Faced with a row of objects we do not, he said, lampooning Wittgenstein, perform appropriately by pointing to one after the other saying that's a tree, that's a tree, that's a man, that's a tree. Rather we will say (pointing) that's a tree,(pointing) that's a tree,(waving) hello!(pointing) that's a tree. What makes us greet the man is not an albeit swift chain of inference, it is his presence which commands the acknowledgement while the presence of the tree does no such thing. Of course, if the man is clearly carved from stone then pointing is in order, and if we subsequently discover that ‘he’ is an inflatable rubber doll we are suitably embarrassed. But we are embarrassed because we got it wrong when usually we do not. In our viewing of the other we see ourselves being viewed; the recognition is mutual. How then is it possible to withhold acknowledgement? Cavell's answer is that it is not. There is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being. In a poignant discussion of the hypothesis that Southern slave owners did not see their slaves as human beings he disagrees: When he wants to be served at table by a black hand, he would not be satisfied to be served by a black paw… Everything in his relation to his slaves shows that he treats them as more or less human — his humiliations of them, his disappointments, his jealousies, his fears, his punishments, his attachments. (Cavell, 1979, p. 376) Treating people as if they were not people is not a possibility; to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster, but it always breaks down. What is possible is to treat people as more or less human. We can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts. This may not be downright evil, but in the absence of potential disbarments (like possibly being a rubber doll) it requires a considerable amount of bad faith. It is very hard to do. This is what Aristotle appears to do to his women. They are human, and are acknowledged to be, they can think but they are not to be acknowledged as authoritative, and if their presence demands such  acknowledgement, they are bad women who should have been taught to hide or repress such demands. Rousseau's blueprint for the education of Sophie is directed at this end, and if it is truly successful, she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement. Then she has been infantilised and she is no longer autonomous. But Rousseau's blueprint contains its own contradiction. If you need to teach people or compel them in some other way to repress their natural demand for acknowledgement as rational, competent, authoritative human beings then you have no answer to the charge of some malefaction between bad faith and dreadful wickedness. Is this unfair to children? When we deny autonomy to our 10-year-old, are we too guilty of bad faith? What reason could we produce to allow that she may have the capacity to act autonomously while denying her the capacity-to-act-autonomously? Whatever it is we should first notice that while the capacity to act autonomously is construed as a psychological capacity, the capacity-to-act-autonomously is not. It is a social capacity which depends upon the acknowledgement of others. What we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust; we have to ask, does her being demand it. CARRYING THE CAN To do this we need to consider another element in the picture of autonomy which was so meticulously side-stepped by Holt. That is, the matter of responsibility. In Freedom and Resentment (1974, p. 19) Strawson talks not of a child's emerging autonomy but of ‘the progressive emergence of the child as a responsible being’. Responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lip-service is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children. I believe it to be central. In his essay, ‘In Defense of Anarchism’(1970), R. P. Wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy. He argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to take responsibility for those actions. To take responsibility is to accept the duty of deciding for oneself what is right. A man, Wolff argues, can forfeit his autonomy by not  taking the responsibility on himself; by, for example, obeying commands blindly; but he cannot abnegate the responsibility which the possibility of choice confers upon him. Since being autonomous includes both freedom of choice and the capacity to reason about those choices, the impairment of either is a bar to autonomy. Against this background he makes two remarks about children: It is quite appropriate that moral philosophers should group together children and madmen as beings not fully responsible for their actions, for as madmen are thought to lack freedom of choice, so children do not yet possess the power of reason in a developed form. It is even just that we should assign a greater degree of responsibility to children, for madmen, by virtue of their lack of free will, are completely without responsibility, while children, insofar as they possess reason in a partially developed form, can be held responsible (i.e. can be required to take responsibility) to a corresponding degree. (Wolff, 1970, pp. 12–13) All men refuse to take responsibility for their actions at some time or other during their lives, and some men so consistently shirk their duty that they present more the appearance of overgrown children than of adults. (Ibid., p. 14) There is a striking similarity between Wolff's way of talking about children and the views we saw put forward by Hobbes, Locke and Kant. Wolff begins with the assurance that children are not rational and then immediately back-pedals to say that actually they are, partially at least. Four paragraphs later where the second quotation appears, the child is not unable to take responsibility but is refusing to take it. She is not an incompetent but a degenerate. Having denied that she is incompetent, I am certainly not going to concede that the only alternative is to make her a degenerate; there must be another choice available. What is missing from Wolff's analysis, though it is present in his terminology, is the recognition of the public face, the mutuality of responsibility. He talks of assigning responsibility to children,holding them responsible,requiring them to take responsibility and these are natural ways of speaking. What they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason; now a third party is present and is an  active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role. People are not only responsible for something, they are responsible to God, other individuals, society or themselves, and this latter Kantian notion is derived from the primary social context in which it makes sense for the concept of responsibility to be invoked. This is just what I was claiming for authority. To say either that someone acts authoritatively or that someone is responsible for his actions may depend upon the possibility of ascribing mental states or capacities but neither is merely a shorthand way of ascribing them. In the case of the fully autonomous person, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. The capacity-to-act-autonomously is the coming together of the two. If both or either is impaired then so is this capacity, and both depend upon the psychological capacities of the agent plus the recognition of other members of the moral and political community. This raises a difficulty. PASSING THE BUCK The problem here seems to be this: am I saying that a child is responsible if and only if we declare her to be so, given that she knows what she is doing? This view has some historical clout. Given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions. Children were still being imprisoned and deported when Mill wrote that disclaimer. Is it then just a matter of fashion, of the times in which we live? Not entirely; to begin with we might take a pragmatic line in the light of new knowledge about the long-term effects of such treatment on a child's subsequent development. We might argue that while we can hold her responsible, the consequences of so doing turn out to be unacceptable. But the horror which writers such as Dickens expressed at the cruelty of his times was prompted by no such knowledge. Dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up at all. What Dickens saw was what most of us see, the inhumanity of treating a child in certain ways. In what does the inhumanity consist? Not just in harsh action; increased concern about children is almost always part of a larger concern about people in general, but when horrible things are happening to people it is not unusual to focus on children and try special pleading on their behalf. This special pleading is, no doubt, partly emotional but it might very well include reference to  children's lack of knowledge and understanding. Yet the inhumanity does not consist in the ascription of certain cognitive states either. We may be quite right to ascribe agency to a child for his acts. The inhumanity seems to lie in allowing the full weight of responsibility to fall on the child. Responsibility is not only about agency. ‘When we say a person is responsible for what he does we mean not just that he was the agent…we also say that the act reflects (back) on the agent,’ writes David Wood (1973, p. 191). How much reflecting goes on depends upon the reflective capabilities of the child and also on the strength and direction of the beam which we, the adults, determine. Perhaps now we can take Mill's insight on board without opening ourselves to the charge of arbitrariness. Mill wanted to protect children against the harm which they might do themselves. The problem which was supposed to bring liberal theory crashing to the ground was that we do not wish to justify interfering with adult liberties on these grounds. It may be that what we are protecting children from is not so much the awful consequences of their ignorant decisions but of the burden of responsibility for those decisions which children are not yet ready to bear and which, for entirely non-political reasons, we cannot choose to impose upon them. If giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a one-person game, then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but I have already argued that they are not and could not be. We can only play at ascribing responsibility outside this mutual interaction; making the horse a senator, blaming the toy which the child trips over are games which do not fool the horse or the toy. Growing up, maturing, emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly. Respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it. We leave unhappy teenagers who ‘don't want to talk about it’ alone; the tearful 5-year-old comes and dumps the problem in your lap. In between, we say, we ‘play it by ear’ and what we listen for is the child's own claim to have its decisions treated as authoritative and to be ready to bear the responsibility. This claim is not a conscious, spoken claim; if it gets to that stage, we have already left it too late. The claim is implicit in the child's own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we  can do no other than acknowledge it. But neither can we impose it. Holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible; we may succeed in the former, without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter. Now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that I have still, therefore, failed to distinguish them from children. However, there is a difference. With children, the presupposition is that we take the responsibility until they show us that they want it; with adults we assume that they take the responsibility unless they show us that they don't. (We are surprised when the ‘man’ turns out to be a robot.) That is what membership of the moral and political community is, and it is a serious business which deserves more attention than I can give here. It is quite correct that children's application for membership should be taken seriously; once accepted there is no turning back, resignation is not an option. To end, a word about voting. Voting is not just a matter of knowing how to put a cross on a piece of paper, nor of having a rough or even quite refined view of the policies of the major political parties. It also, in a democracy, involves being responsible to some degree for the society which we have. Maybe ‘I didn't vote Tory’, but even that does not enable me to opt out of that responsibility entirely. Why else would I buy the sticker? Let us ask our 10-year-old's mother if her daughter is ready to take that responsibility. What would she say? Perhaps that, yes, her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable; yes, she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions. Also, perhaps, that sometimes at night, she finds her crying for the starving of Africa or unable to sleep with the terror of the possibility of nuclear war or desperately seeking a denial of the reality of the horror of the Holocaust. Perhaps she would be angry if, by trying to impose responsibility on her daughter by giving her the vote, we were also taking from her the only comfort which she has, namely that when she is older she will change all that. Or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready; she would be right. Denying the vote to children is not based on some false assumption about 10-year-olds' political knowledge, nor to deny that they have interests, nor to protect them from the harm their votes might do. It is to take responsibility to ourselves for the way the world is. And that really does belong to us."
ACA ACA-FEF-001 6.17 "1. Maxwell's equations One of the chief peculiarities of this treatise is the doctrine which asserts, that the true electric current on which the electromagnetic phenomena depend, is not the same thing as the current of conduction, but that the time variation of the electric displacement must be taken into account in estimating the total movement of electricity. JAMES CLARK MAXWELL A treatise on electricity and magnetism Oxford 1873 ALL the problems we shall be concerned with may be solved by calling upon one or more of the following equations: . Where do the above equations come from? They are contained (though not quite in the same form and not in the same system of units) in Chapter IX of Maxwell's Treatise on electricity and magnetism published in 1873. Are we to conclude that electromagnetic theory has made no advance in the course of a century? That conclusion would essentially be correct. Our technique of solving the above equations has improved, and of course we are in a much better position now to evaluate the material constants, but fundamentally electromagnetic theory stands now as it stood a century ago. As far as the interrelationship of electromagnetic quantities is concerned Maxwell knew as much as we do today. He did not actually suggest communication between continents with the aid of geostationary satellites, but if he was taken now to a satellite ground-station he would not be numbed with astonishment. If we would give him half an hour to get over the shock of his resurrection he would quietly sit down with a piece of paper (the back of a bigger envelope, I suppose) and would work out the relevant design formulae. The lack of advance on our part should not be attributed to the idleness of a century, much rather to the genius of Maxwell. The moment he conceived the idea of the displacement current, a new era started in the history of mankind. Events of similar importance did not occur often. Newton's Principia and Einstein's first paper on relativity would qualify, and perhaps two or three more learned papers, but that's about all. If we assume that our kind of beings will still be around a few millennia hence, I feel certain that the nineteenth century will mainly be remembered as the century when Maxwell formulated his equations. What was so extraordinary about Maxwell's contribution? It was the first (and may be the best) example of reaching a synthesis on the basis of experimental evidence, mathematical intuition, and prophetic insight. The term  (1.1) had no experimental basis at the time. By adding this new term to the known equations he managed to describe all macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena. And when relativity came, Newton's equations were found wanting but not Maxwell's; they needed no relativistic correction. I could go on for a long time in praise of Maxwell. Unfortunately we have little time for digressions however entertaining they might be. But before we get down to the equations I must say a few words in defence of the approach I choose. I know it must be hard for anyone to accept a set of equations without going through the usual routine of presenting the relevant experimental justifications. It might seem a little unreasonable at first sight but believe me this is a possible approach, and under the circumstances it may very well be the best approach. You are already familiar with the mathematical operations curl, div, and grad (I prefer using them in vector-operator form), and you need no introduction to the concepts of electricity. You have heard about electric charge, current, magnetic field, etc. All the eqns (1.1) -(1.7) do is go give a number of relationships between these quantities. So if some of them are known, you can use the equations to work out some of the others. The notation is fairly standard but still I should better say what is what: H, magnetic field strength; E, electric field strength; D, electric flux density; B, magnetic flux density; J, current density; p, charge density; F, force, q, charge; v, velocity of moving charge; u, permeability; e, permittivity. The  two latter quantities are constants depending on the material under study. Using the subscript zero to denote their values in free space, they come to . The rest of the course will be concerned with the various solutions of eqns (1.1) -(1.7). Isn't this boring for an engineer? Shouldn't this be done by mathematicians or by computer programmers? Not for the time being. Perhaps one day computers will be big enough and numerical analysts clever enough so that the engineer will only have to pose the problem, but not yet, and not, I think, for some time to come. In the large majority of cases a straightforward mathematical solution is just out of the question. So one has to use that delicate substance known as physical intuition. How can one acquire physical intuition? There is no easy way. One has to start with a simple physical configuration, solve the corresponding mathematical problem, then solve a similar problem and then another problem, and then a little more difficult problem, and soon. The first breakthrough comes when one can predict a solution without actually doing the mathematics. In order to have a unified view of the subject we have started with Maxwell's equations. It means a new approach but not a radical departure. The subject is still the same. You will be able to see that the laws you love and cherish (Coulomb's, Biot-Savart's, Snell's, etc.) all follow from our eqns (1.1) -(1.7). The order of discussion will follow the traditional one: electrostatics first, followed by steady currents, then we shall move on to slowly varying phenomena, and reach finally the most interesting part, fast-varying phenomena, exhibiting the full beauty of Maxwell's wonderful equations."
ACA ACA-FPG-001 4.43 "DIRECT FILE ORGANIZATION 6.1 Introduction Records can be retrieved directly from files that have been organized in many ways. In this chapter we shall be dealing with files that have been designed to make direct record retrieval as easy and rapid as possible. These are known as directly organized files . It is possible to process the records in a directly organized file either directly, using the keys in any desired order, or serially, taking the records in the order they are stored and ignoring their keys. Both direct and serial processing of directly organized files are dealt with in this chapter. Direct processing of files organized sequentially or using the indexed sequential technique is covered in the chapters devoted to those types of organization. Records are often processed in a random order. A bank cannot predict which of its customers wish to withdraw or deposit money on any given day; a travel firm cannot control which of its package tours will be booked at a particular time. Customers arrive as a result of their own decisions, and not in an order dictated by the travel agent or bank. As these transactions are not predictable they present a processing problem. When an immediate response is not required, the transactions can be collected into batches, sorted into a key sequence that matches the appropriate master file, and processed sequentially. However, if the customer is waiting for an immediate answer, there is no time for this. The record has to be checked at once— to see if a booking is available, for example — and this means that the file has to be referenced without preparatory sorting or processing. As the records are processed in a sequence that cannot be predetermined, we are faced with the problem that we know the key or control number of the record but have no indication of its location in storage. It would be possible to search through the file until the record was located, but this technique, and the more refined methods available for searching sequential files in which there is no direct relationship between the record key and its storage location, are too slow for the needs of most enquiry systems. We must look for a way of establishing a relationship between the key of the record and its address , and using this relationship to retrieve the record rapidly. The relationship can take several forms. First, it can be an index of every  record position in the file; modifications of this method lead to indexed sequential files , and are dealt with in Chapter 7. Second, each record can be stored at an address that is directly related to its key, e.g. at the address which is the same as the key (record 20 in address 20 and so on). This type of file is known as a self-indexing or self-addressing file . If it is not possible to find a relationship of this sort, some other method of assigning addresses to keys has to be found. Usually, a suitable algorithm is used to convert keys to addresses; the file is then described as a randomized file , and the algorithm used is called a randomizing algorithm . The process is often also described as hashing . The application of these methods of assigning storage positions to records is discussed in detail in this chapter, and reference tables are provided to aid the file designer. This is followed by sections on optimizing the performance of direct files, and on the practical steps that can be taken to maximize the efficiency of these files in operation. 6.2 Self-indexing Continuous key sequences If record keys are numeric and there are not many gaps in the sequence, it is often possible to allocate a storage position based directly on the key. In the simplest case, records with keys such as 00 000 to 99 999 could be allocated to any contiguous set of 100000 storage positions. Some direct access devices have available storage areas starting from 00 000 or 00001, and addressed by a simple number. When devices of this type are available, the storing of records with a continuous set of keys is straightforward. However, the conversion from a numeric user-address to a device address in terms of cylinders and records is carried out by the manufacturer's software, and thus involves an overhead of both primary storage space and CPU time. If locations with the same addresses as the record keys are available, then each record is stored in the appropriate position, and a record can be retrieved by the use of the relationship: If a contiguous area of storage is available elsewhere, or if the keys are continuous but start at a figure outside the range of the storage addresses available, an addition or subtraction will be needed. In this case: where β is a constant. For example, if 20 000 records with keys  are to be stored in locations , then: An additional factor arises when keys do not go up in ones, but in twos, threes, fives, tens or some other increment. In this case, to allow for the increment not being unity, the relationship becomes: where α and β are constants. An example of this might be keys 00 003, 00006, 00 009, 00012, etc., to be stored in positions 00352, 00 353,…. Then: As explained in Chapter 2, many disks have a discontinuous or complex address format. An example of this is the IBM disk range, in which the basic form of disk address is CCHHR, where: CC is a two-character cylinder number; HH is a two-character head number; R is a one-character record number. R starts from record 1 on each track, as record 0 is a control record. Because there is no record 0, the nearest that can be obtained to a continuous set of numbers will be: Thus addresses: are missing. Such a near-continuous set of numbers can only be obtained if nine records are stored per track, and this will usually not be the best number of records for the file under consideration. Normally we shall have sets of addresses of the form: As calculations in main storage take very little time, it is well worthwhile converting the key values into this form by means of an algorithm. For example: a file is to be stored on a 3380 disk, fourteen records per track, starting at cylinder 23. The record keys are continuous starting from 14 836; the position of a record with the key 15 302 would be calculated as follows: i.e. this is the 467th record in the file: This means that it will be stored as the fifth record on the thirty-fourth track of the file. As there are fifteen tracks per cylinder on the 3380, this means that the record address will be cylinder 25, track 3 (the fourth track on the cylinder because IBM use track numbers starting from 0), record 5. The full address will be  The general formula here is that, with: where we consider only the integer part of the division. If the remainder is R: where we consider only the integer part of the division. Let the remainder be R'; then  This calculation may look cumbersome, but it takes very little time and provides record storage positions very effectively. Integer arithmetic should be used, to avoid the problems of approximate answers. If necessary, considerably more complex calculations are justified because of the speed of internal storage operations, and because use of such a calculation allows the unbroken key sequence to be exploited. Manufacturers usually provide relative record addressing which carries out these calculations for the user. Broken key sequences Inherently continuous sequences Although the key sequence in a new file is often continuous, gaps will usually soon occur. Customers turn elsewhere or go out of business, old product numbers are replaced by new, and so on. The advantage of being able to store such a file on a direct access device in addresses which are directly related to the key then has to be balanced against the waste of space involved. A self-indexing file can be referenced sequentially by normal sequential processing, and directly using a single seek because of the relations between key and storage address. No other file organization can achieve this, so it is worth accepting a fairly low packing density to retain the file in this form. If direct access capacity is a limitation, a loss of 15 — 20 per cent of space will still compare well with other file organizations (see Chapter 7 and the calculations of packing density for randomly organized direct files later in this chapter). Where access time is the vital criterion and direct access storage is abundant, a packing density of as little as 50 per cent is justifiable for a file accessed both directly and sequentially. Where maximum direct access throughput is essential, even lower packing densities may be accepted (see the average space used by randomized files to compare, p. 310). Unused storage positions should be filled with dummy records, so that they can be recognized at once. In setting up a file with a number of dummy records, these dummies will be filled with a character such as & or •that will be tested for during serial processing. The problem should not arise during direct processing, as every valid key has a corresponding record. If it does, then an error will be indicated. However, the test for a dummy must be carried out during direct processing to guard against an invalid key being processed (see Fig. 6.1). This technique is only directly applicable to fixed-length records. It can be applied to variable-length records by padding or the use of fixed-length   buckets for variable records, as discussed previously. In the latter case addressing will probably only point to a bucket number, and in searching the bucket for a particular record using the direct technique it will no longer be an error to detect a dummy record, but part of the search. Naturally broken sequences Record keys often do not start as an unbroken sequence. In a simple case, we might have the following key set: These thirty-four records need only 34 storage positions, but if they were stored in self-indexing form they would take up 359 storage positions, and there would be five gaps of 91, 1, 1, 94 and 138 positions respectively. These gaps can be eliminated by a sequence of tests of the type shown below: The gaps are eliminated as shown in Fig. 6.2. Typically, keys form broken sequences because they contain separate items of information. For example, a product code used as a key may contain sections for such fields as: There may be room left for additions to the number of products, product types, factories, categories, etc. This can lead to a series of continuous keys with gaps left in it at intervals. This can be converted into a continuous sequence of keys so long as the various constants involved in the key are known. For example, if the category can take the values 1 to 7, the factory number can be 01 to 11, the product type can be 01 to 37, and the number of products in the type can range from 001 to 999, with 147 being the largest required at present (the number varies with type), then we might have the following runs of continuous numbers made up of the digits representing the category, factory, product type and number of products: These runs of continuous numbers have to be turned into a single sequence, starting from 1. There are 2849 runs of numbers; as given above the most in one run is 147, and the least shown is 84. One way of combining these runs into a single sequence is shown in Fig. 6.3. This process requires a table of 2849 entries, each showing the cumulative total of records up to the start of that set. To ensure that all the product types for a given category and factory are kept together, the following algorithm is used: This arranges for every product type for category 1 and factory 1 to come first, and every factory in category 1 to precede those in category 2. If this routine is written in a programming language such as PL/1, Algol or Fortran, the calculation is not necessary; the subscript facility can be used, and the table entries referenced as TABLE (CAT, FAC, PROD). In the example shown in Fig. 6.3, the entry required would be TABLE (1, 1, 3). This example requires a large table; if there is not room in primary storage for such a table it is not possible to handle the file as a self-indexing file, and a different method of addressing must be used. It is almost always a lack of storage space, or the fact that the file is dynamic and so cannot be loaded in a single operation, that prevents self-indexing, and not the time taken to carry out the calculations. Before leaving the subject of self-indexing, it is worth mentioning perfect hash functions . These generally refer to finding a self-indexing function for tables in main storage; Jaeschke has developed a method originally proposed by Cichell, and he has shown that, however complicated the key sequence is, a self-indexing function can be found for up to 40 keys so that they fit exactly into a table with the same number of storage positions. For larger tables — up to about 1000 keys — a more approximate but less time-consuming method due to Sprugnoli can be used. The small size of these ‘files’ make such techniques applicable only to main storage tables; in that sphere, they are very useful. 6.3 Algorithmic addressing The keys used for many data files are not suited to any practical self-indexing transformation, so other methods of establishing a relationship between record keys and storage addresses have been developed. What is needed is a transformation — usually called an algorithm — that can be carried out on a key to yield a storage address. Naturally, it must always yield the same address from the same key. Any such transformation will involve the compression of a diffuse key set, containing many gaps, into a much smaller range of addresses; if this is not the case, the file should be self-indexed. Whatever the size and complexity of the key, the factors that control the transformation are the same. They are: 1 The number of addresses to be generated. This will depend on the number of records if each record is to have its own address. If groups of records are to be stored in buckets, it will be related to the number of buckets required. 2 The direct access space required and, in some cases,its distribution . It is desirable to have a single file area, both for efficient file processing and for simplicity, but this is not always possible. At all events the user will have to estimate the amount of direct access storage space the file needs, and this will affect the algorithm used. A number of techniques are available to handle files that have dynamic space requirements, and these are discussed later. 3 The direct access starting address . It will not be enough to produce a set of generated addresses corresponding to the number of record storage positions required. They will also have to start from the specified starting address on the device, and must all lie within the allocated range. The process will be as shown in Fig. 6.4. Assume that n records are to be stored, and N addresses are available for record storage. Transformation of keys into addresses by an algorithm will produce r addresses. The relationship between r, n and N is: Ideally just one key would be associated with each address and every address available would be used. In this case . In practice neither condition is likely to be met. The factors determining how closely the ideal case can be approached are examined in the following sections. How synonyms occur Sometimes two or more record keys are transformed by an algorithm into the same address. The first record to be allocated that address can be stored there, and is described as the home record . Any subsequent record to be allocated to that address has to be stored elsewhere. It is called a synonym , and will overflow from its natural home address because that is already full. The situation is modified when records are stored in buckets holding several records, but synonyms still occur. This is examined later (see p. 173). As a synonym is not held at the address the program has computed, a further search is needed to find it. This leads to loss of time, and synonyms are the reason that algorithmically addressed files give a slower response than self-indexing files; home records are retrieved just as quickly. Much of the rest of this chapter shows how to minimize the number of synonyms, and to reduce the effect of those that remain. It might seem that a suitable algorithm could be found which would not generate synonyms. This is very unlikely. In some cases the algorithm will spread the addresses evenly over the allocated storage area, and in the ideal case will have an equal probability of generating any address within that area; in other cases the existing key order can be used to improve the efficiency of record storage. In either case some addresses will be generated more than once, while others will not be generated at all. A different set of keys will produce a different set of synonyms, and of unused record spaces. Statistically, however, the chance of avoiding synonyms altogether is vanishingly small. Heising has pointed out that if n records are randomized into N addresses, there are N n possible record distributions, only  of which allocate no more than one record to any address. If 4000 records are stored in 5000 addresses then only one algorithm in every  will achieve this, which rules out a search for a perfect randomizing algorithm on a trial-and-error basis. This can be seen in a qualitative way by considering the party game in which participants guess how many people would need to be asked their birthdays, on average, to find two with birthdays on the same day. Many people will answer 365 (or 366!). Some will answer 365/2 or 183 for safety. Few will guess that a group of twenty-three will, on average, contain two people with birthdays on the same day. This is followed by experimental proof, to general surprise. As twenty-three birthdays spread at random over 365 addresses can cause duplication, it is not surprising that no randomizing algorithm can avoid synonyms when packing thousands of records into a set of addresses that is only 10–20 per cent greater than the number of records! When records are randomly distributed among the available addresses, the probability of 0, 1, 2,…,x records being allocated to any given address that can hold a single record can be calculated as follows: Let the number of records be defined as n and the total address locations as N. This corresponds with the symbols used in equation (6.1). When records are randomized to N locations the probability of any particular address being generated due to the transformation of a single key is 1/N. As a result of n records being allocated, the probability of a given location having been allocated x records is given by the terms of the binomial expression: Thus  This expression is precise. However, it has the disadvantage that it is not general, but has to be calculated separately for every n and N.  When n and N are very much larger than 1, which applies in any normal data file, the Poisson distribution may be used as an approximation to the binomial. The derivation of this is given in statistics textbooks and practical examples of its application, and an assessment of the closeness of the approximation, are given later in this chapter (see p. 169). The advantage of using the Poisson distribution is that p (x ) now depends on the value of the ratio (n/N). This represents the packing density of the file, and is much more general than n or N used independently, as all files with the same packing density give the same results irrespective of the value of N and n . From the Poisson distribution: By evaluating the above expression for x and setting …we can obtain the corresponding probabilities that a given address will have: and so on. Where a file area contains N addresses we can expect: In theory we could provide just sufficient space in the file for all the records. This would certainly simplify equation (6.3) to yield: but it is clear intuitively that we cannot completely fill the file, as the last available storage position would on average be half the file area away from the last record's computed address. We shall look at ways of choosing a more suitable packing density in more detail later (see p. 172). 6.4 Methods of randomizing Whenever an algorithm is used to store a direct file, the implication is that self-indexing is not practical. This usually means that the keys of the file are too diffuse to store directly, and the key range has to be compressed by using an algorithm. There are two possibilities: either to exploit the existing key  order — if that is possible — or to completely destroy that order, and to allocate keys to addresses as randomly as possible. Both of these options are examined below. Order-preserving algorithms 1 Using the low order part of a key  Where a key is a long number, consisting perhaps of ten digits, but we only have 8000 records and hence need only to allocate 10 000 storage positions, we could use the last four digits of the key as a storage address. This is suspect because keys may always end in 2, 5, or some other specific number, or always be divisible by 2, 5 or some such constant. There might also be a departmental or other code in the centre of the key, and we might obtain all the records in three areas starting with numbers such as 03, 05 or 07 if the choice of storage address is unfortunate. This is analysed further elsewhere. This technique can, however, give very good results if the low order digits of the key are consecutive integers with few gaps. 2 Using middle or upper order parts of a key  The same considerations dictate against the use of either of these as storage addresses. It may not be obvious that order exists in the key sequence, yet it may be present and damaging. 3 End folding  A ten-digit key such as 1 234 567 890 may be reduced to ‘fit’ 50 000 storage positions by carrying out the steps: This method is fairly effective. It destroys the original key pattern more completely than operations 1 and 2 above, but retains the ability to separate keys that are part of consecutive runs. This can lead to results that improve on perfect randomization, but it depends on the key sequence and is not reliable (see Buchholz and Lum et al. for further details). 4 Division by a non-prime  If we divide a large key by an appropriate number — probably dictated by the  file storage area — and use the remainder as an address, this will provide a precise method of fitting addresses to available storage. For example, if we have 98 000 positions of storage in which to store the records, from 50 001 to 148 000, we could carry out the following calculation: The record address is 124 790. This process looks effective, but the last three digits of the key are unchanged by the division. It turns out that any number divided by 98 000 will give a remainder with the last three digits unchanged, as 98000 itself is divisible by 1000. This means that the last part of the original key pattern remains: if this includes a code of, say, 05 then randomization will be incomplete. For that reason a divisor should be chosen that is not itself divisible by 2, 3, 5, 10 or any of their simple multiples. In our example the divisor is divisible by 1000, which leads to three unchanged digits. Buchholz has shown that non-prime odd numbers can give very good results, but are not reliable unless they have no divisors less than about 19. This choice is also discussed by Lum et al. 5 Division by a prime  The logical extension of avoiding multiples of 2, 3, 5, 10, etc., is to use a large prime number. This usually leads to removal of the effect of any repeating pattern such as a 2, 5 or 0 in the last digit because every digit in the number divided is involved in the division, and so may be altered. However, sequences of keys differing by one will yield remainders differing by one. So long as two key sequences do not produce overlapping remainders this can achieve results considerably better than true randomization. The process is as follows: a) Decide on a packing density for the file. If n records are to be stored in N addresses, this packing density (α) will be  Let n be 85 000. A suitable α might be 85 per cent(this is discussed in more detail later). In our example this would mean that  storage positions would be required for the file. b) Select a prime near to 100 000 — say 99 991 — and divide. The remainders of this division will lie in the range 0–99 990. If the storage area does not start at 0, then a simple addition will convert this figure to the address range required. c) The number of synonyms resulting from this process should be compared with those to be expected from perfect randomization; see p. 166 for methods of doing this. If the results are similar to or better than those predicted theoretically, the transformation is satisfactory. If not, a different prime number should be selected and the process repeated. In selecting a prime number, primes of the form  should be avoided, where B is the number base and k a small integer. This is because the binomial expansion of  shows that the remainder will contain superposed m digit groups of the original key. This tendency remains for small integer values of k, reducing as k increases in size. Thus primes such as 4999, 7001, 79 999, etc., are best not used for decimal keys. A table of prime numbers, selected so that they are not too near to a factor of ten, and close enough in value to allow any packing density to be selected within half of a percent, is given in Appendix 4. Decimal keys should be retained in decimal form; alpha or alphanumeric keys are best handled in binary. Some prime numbers can usually be found that give a good transformation — in fact it is the high probability that any suitable prime chosen will do so, allied to the ease with which this technique can be used to fit any number of records into precisely the required storage space, that makes this such a convenient method. However, if a number of primes have failed, it may be sensible to consider complete randomization. 6 Order-preserving algorithms in general  A large number of order-preserving algorithms were examined by Amble and Knuth, showing how they compared for completion of successful and unsuccessful searches for records. Many of these are suitable only for table searching in main storage, but the principles are of interest to direct file designers. Ouksel presented a method in which parts of the original key such as area code, factory number and part type can be retained by the use of bit tables. Garg and Gotlieb have developed a method that is related to interpolation searching, and in which the algorithm is based on an analysis of the key sequence, rather than on a presupposition such as the effectiveness of any particular procedure — say mid-square or division. Order-preserving algorithms are still being developed, but the success of division shows that order-preserving algorithms are an important resource to the file designer. Genuinely randomizing algorithms 1 Square the key and select a part  This depends on squaring the whole or part of the key, and taking a number of digits from the centre of the resulting value. An example might be: This gives a potential range of addresses between 000 000 and 999 999. The records can be compressed into some other range such as 250 000 by repetitive subtraction of 250 000, and the method usually gives very good randomization. It is often not convenient to square a large integer so a selected part of the key may be squared instead. This technique is not always as effective as division, but does achieve a nearly random distribution, and so is useful when it is not possible to exploit any existing order in the key sequence. 2 Selecting digits from different parts of the key  Sometimes, rather than selecting a single part of the key, several areas are used. This may operate as follows: This would normally be expected to produce results rather worse than the mid-square method, but it has proved to be very effective on occasions (see p. 169 for further discussion). 3 Quadratic and quadratic quotient hashing  These two techniques, due to Maurer (quadratic hashing) and Bell (quadratic quotient hashing), can be used to eliminate primary and secondary clustering of keys after division. Primary clustering results from runs of keys, in that they will be allocated to adjacent storage positions after division; this is dispersed by quadratic hashing, in which the final storage position of the record depends on a function of the remainder from the original division, summed with a function of the square of the remainder. This does separate members of a run of keys, but it fails to separate two or more records that randomize to a particular storage position. Bell termed this ‘secondary clustering’ and showed that, by using both the quotient and the remainder from the original division, it was possible to eliminate it. These two techniques are primarily intended for use in table searching in main storage, and are only incidentally usable for direct files; it is worth noting that they are intended to eliminate the order-preserving properties of division, while using division as a convenient randomizing algorithm. Examples of randomizing algorithms in practice Although small files cannot be used to analyse the way in which randomization techniques perform, they are useful to demonstrate the essential features of these techniques. The ways in which division, mid-square and end-folding operate are illustrated below. 1 Division  Assume that a ‘mini-file’ of seventeen records is to be stored as a direct file, and that the file is to be 85 per cent packed. The file will therefore require twenty storage positions. Seventeen random numbers in the range 000 to 200 (representing the record keys) can be selected by choosing the first numbers within the required range occurring in a random number table. They are in the following order: 059, 035, 078, 136, 171, 148, 005, 135, 010, 196, 057, 187, 110, 100, 030, 127, 197. These numbers are divided by 19, to give remainders in the range 0 to 18. This leaves the twentieth position of the storage area as an ‘overflow’, since no record will randomize to it. In effect, the key range 000–200 is cut into 19 digit sections, and the remainders that result from the division in each section are superposed on each other to provide the record addresses. The records in the same section cannot randomize to the same address, so that synonyms arise by records in different sections having the same remainder. The result of this operation, for the keys given above, is shown in Fig. 6.5(a). As a result of dividing by 19 there will be six synonyms — 00, 02, 02, 05, 15 and 16. This is  or 32.4 per cent of the total, and compares with an ‘expected’ value of 32.63 per cent. This is sheer chance, but suggests a good average result from the use of the algorithm! This set of keys is intended to be random and so has no order to preserve. If a key includes fields to indicate district, stock classification or the like, runs of keys will occur in the key sequence. Division will avoid keys in the same run clashing, and causing synonyms. Seventeen records are to be stored as an 85 per cent packed direct file. Consider the key set: The remainders after the division by 19 are shown in Fig. 6.5(b). The very good performance of division reported in some cases (Lum, Yuen and Dodd, Severance and Duhne), and relatively poor performance in others (Kaimann), is likely to have been the result of few or many clashes of this kind. Because there are fewer runs of keys than separate keys, the results of division are likely to be more variable than those of genuine randomization. However, division has a fundamental advantage, which is the reason for its good performance: no two records in any single section into which the key sequence is ‘cut’ by division can interfere with any other in the same section, because no two different numbers can have both the same quotient and the same remainder. Effectively, this means that if the file has been ‘cut’ into m sections, the effective packing density of the file — from the point of view of records colliding and causing synonyms — is: 2 Mid-square  In this case we square the whole key and take a centre part of it to allocate the records to buckets. In order to fit the result of selecting two decimal digits (a maximum value of 99) into a range of twenty storage positions, 20 is subtracted repetitively from the two digits until the result is less than 20. This process gives eight synonyms (00, 02, 02, 04, 08, 10, 10, 10). It is rather unexpected that most of the values obtained are even. This is not a general result, and shows that this algorithm, which gives  or 47 per cent of synonyms, does not suit this key set. The reader might like to check that, if the second and third digits are used instead of the third and fourth, there will be seven synonyms instead of eight (00, 01, 01, 04, 09, 12, 12). However, this is still not a good result. Applying the same algorithm to the other key set, the results are shown at the top of the next page. This gives a reasonable result in terms of synonyms: six out of seventeen, or 35 per cent. The reader may care to confirm that, if the third and fourth digits are selected instead, there will be eight synonyms. 3 End-folding  Usually we would be satisfied with the results of one or other of the first two techniques. Out of interest, we will try one other method on these key sets — end-folding. This involves ‘folding’ one part of the key under the rest and adding. If the value we get is more than 19, we will subtract 20 repetitively until it is brought into the range 0 to 19. For example: Interestingly, this creates only four synonyms, and is thus a very effective algorithm. With the five runs of keys, the resulting addresses are: Here, the number of synonyms is three. In general, end-folding does not achieve such good results, but this illustrates how — with a very small ‘file’ and key size — results can be variable. In this case, due to the form of key and the end-folding digits chosen, end-folding is acting very similarly to an order-preserving algorithm. 6.5 Testing for successful randomization After an algorithm has been selected, it is wise to ensure that it will be successful before using it in a program. A reasonable guide will be if it produces results near to or better than those predicted by equation (6.3). The algorithm and the file keys have to be analysed, which can be done either by writing an analysis program and inputting the keys, transforming them into addresses and recording the numbers of synonyms, or by using a standard analysis program. This is obtainable from manufacturers or from many bureaux, and will give numbers of synonyms, their distribution and comparisons with the ‘ideal’ randomized distribution. Kaimann has carried out a series of randomizing experiments, based on a file of 48 950 records. These were randomized to 100 000 storage positions. We shall examine the results of his experiments and compare them with the results that we would expect if the records were perfectly randomized. In order to decide this we shall calculate the expected probability that an  address will contain no record, one record only, one synonym (two records allocated to one address), two synonyms and so on. It was stated earlier that the Poisson distribution was a satisfactory approximation to the binomial in a case such as this; to test this assertion both equation (6.2) and equation (6.3) have been used to calculate the expected ‘perfectly randomized’ results. Using equation (6.2) derived from the binomial theorem, the probability that an address will have x records allocated to it is: Now: Thus  This looks formidable, and the probabilities for higher values of x are complicated to calculate. However, an iterative method of calculation can be developed from equation (6.2) as follows: Using equations (6.6) and (6.7) we can calculate a starting value, p(0), and a factor by which this and each succeeding value is to be multiplied to yield the next value. This is  This binomial figure is relatively easy to calculate, but the Poisson values derived from equation (6.3) are a great deal simpler, in particular the starting value p(0). Equation (6.3) stated that: From this: Dividing the probabilities for x and (x — 1): As the Poisson calculations also provide general rather than specific figures, it would be preferable to use them if there is no reason to reject the results. Using equations (6.9) and (6. 10) the required Poisson values can be calculated very rapidly; they are particularly suited to a pocket calculator, as the starting value can be calculated and then modified by multiplying the contents of the calculator by the packing density and dividing by the next value of ‘x’: 1 when the calculator holds p(0), 2 when it holds p(1) and so on. The values obtained for binary and Poisson probabilities are shown in Table 6.1 for the case where a file of 48 950 records is randomized to 100 000 storage positions. It is clear from the table that the correspondence between binomial and Poisson values is very close. For a file of this size, no value has been altered materially due to the simplification of using Poisson values. In any real case a variation of several hundred from the predicted value would be expected due to chance alone, while predictions based on the two methods do not differ by as much as one record in any file examined by the author. For this reason the simpler and more general Poisson calculations are used from now on in this book. One of the most comprehensive studies of the results of randomization trials that has been reported was due to Kaimann. The values tabulated   here give us a measure of comparison for Kaimann's experimental results. Fig. 6.6 shows the theoretical curve for the values of p(0) to p(7), taken from Table 6. 1, plotted against equivalent curves for the following techniques: 1 The remainder after division by 100000, i.e. the last digits of the nine-digit key. 2 The five high-order digits of the key used directly as an address. 3 The middle five digits of the square of the key. 4 Five of the six junior digits, discarding the thousands digit and combining the rest. 5 Five of the digits from the nine-digit key, two from the first five and three from the next four, e.g. for 987 654 321: 6 The remainder after division of the key by the largest prime under 100000 (99 991). Table 6.2 shows the number of addresses that have been allocated the stated number of records per address (up to seven), and the percentage of the total number of records in the file that was successfully allocated by each of the six algorithms used by Kaimann. The very wide differences between the results achieved by different randomization techniques are shown in Table 6.2 and Fig. 6.7. However, none of the results given here indicate randomization that is fully successful. It is interesting that a fairly ad-hoc method of transformation (Test 5) is in most respects more successful than division by a prime number. This suggests that by chance some underlying order in the key sequence has affected randomization. However, the number of long synonym chains is less after division by a prime than by this digit selection. A further search for a successful algorithm — probably for a more suitable prime — is indicated in      a case like this. As the key range, nine digits, is potentially 10 000 times the address range, 100 000, even division can only be expected to equal or very marginally improve on perfect randomization. 6.6 Minimizing the effect of synonyms Now that the inevitability of synonyms occurring has been made clear, we must consider how to deal with them. This can best be described in a series of steps: 1 Ensure that the number of synonyms is at a minimum. This can be achieved by the selection of a suitable bucket size, packing density, randomizing algorithm and record-loading technique. 2 Use an efficient method of storing and retrieving the synonyms generated. 3 Arrange that the most frequently referenced records are in the home positions. 4 Reorganize the file at intervals — unless a randomization technique that allocates space as it is required has been used. Each of these measures is examined in detail below. Minimizing the number of synonyms Packing density and bucket size If we decide to store each record in a storage position able to hold only one record, even a perfectly random distribution will give a high proportion of synonyms. Table 6.3 has been calculated using equation (6.6.). The table is built up by calculating p(0), and hence the probability that any given address would not have a home record allocated to it. Multiplying this by 100 and subtracting the result from 100 per cent, we obtain the percentage of addresses that will contain home records. This is shown in the second row. Subtraction of this figure from the total of all the records as a percentage of the addresses, i.e. from the packing density, gives the number of synonyms as a percentage of the addresses. This figure is expressed as a percentage of the records in the bottom row. For 30 per cent packing the calculation is as follows: A glance at the percentages of synonyms shows that even when the file is   only 20 per cent packed, almost 10 per cent of the file will be stored as synonyms. When we wish to retrieve a synonym, the algorithm will give an ‘incorrect’ address. Whatever method of storing synonyms is used, time will be lost as a result. Some way must be found to reduce the number of synonyms, in order to increase the efficiency of direct retrieval. If buckets large enough to hold several records are used, we can expect that these buckets will be more evenly filled than individual records fill single addresses; this can be examined using the Poisson distribution. Equation (6.3) for randomization to individual addresses is: Let the number of buckets be B; then during a single address calculation each bucket location has a probability of being generated of (1/B), and a probability (1 — 1/B) that it will not be generated. Assuming the number of buckets is large, the Poisson distribution can once more be used as an approximation to the binomial distribution. Then: Note that the value (n/B) will now usually exceed unity, and that the packing density of the file will depend on how many records can be stored in each bucket. To calculate p(0) substitute (n/B) for (n/N) in equation (6.8): and also, modifying equation (6.9): The percentage of records that will be stored as synonyms, for any given bucket size and packing density, can be derived as follows (the full explanation of the calculations is given in reference 15): Let the packing density be p and the number of records per bucket be r . The percentage of synonyms to be expected for any given case, assuming that record allocation to addresses is entirely random and that synonyms are only stored after all home records, is as follows: Define the total file storage capacity as 1. The sum of the probabilities for space to which records have not been allocated, P EMPTY , is: The rest of the total file area must therefore hold home records, i.e.  (Note : The proportion of the file area that contains home records is calculated indirectly rather than directly, because the sum of home record probabilities is made up of an infinite series, while that of the empty positions is finite, as is clear from equation (6.13).) As the packing density is α, a proportion α of the total file area will hold records when the loading process is complete. The probability of a record becoming a synonym is therefore given by subtracting the proportion of the file area occupied by home records from the total proportion of the file area taken up by the file, that is α. The user will normally wish to express this as a percentage of the records loaded, which is: The value of P SYNONYMS can be calculated using an iterative procedure by combining the expressions given in equations (6. 13) and (6.15): This expression can be summed iteratively, as the first term within the brace has the value . Let this be . Then each successive term is obtained by using the relationship: Table 6.4 shows the expected percentage of overflow records when records are randomized to buckets containing from one to 600 records. The table shows figures down to 0.01 per cent of synonyms, and Fig. 6.7 is useful for extrapolation between values, and understanding the overall relationship between bucket size and packing density. From the table and figure, it is clear that far fewer records will be displaced if we randomize to a multi-record bucket rather than to an individual record position. For example, with a file that is only 50 per cent packed, we must expect 21.31 per cent of the records not to be stored in their home record positions if we randomize to a specific address. Using buckets capable of holding only two records will improve this figure to 10.36 per cent. If we use buckets of eight records at a time, less than 1 per cent of the records will be synonyms, and this is reduced to 0. 1 per cent for buckets of fifteen records. Hence it is clear that, if records are randomized to individual storage positions or to small buckets, many records will become synonyms. Unless the records are stored singly there is no corresponding improvement in speed of finding the desired record, because the access comb will reach the track at a point decided by chance, and there will be an average delay of at least half a revolution before the start of the record is reached. The advantage of single records is that they can be stored in CKD format — with separate keys — and the track can be scanned for a particular record without having to read unwanted records into main storage. Multiple record buckets cannot be handled in this way, as groups of records that randomize to the same bucket do not generally have anything else in common, so that the whole bucket has to be searched to see if the desired record is in it. So, although there is clearly an argument for using buckets that are as large as possible, over-large buckets will mean that an extended search through the bucket will be required to locate the desired record. Since there are advantages both in storing records singly and in using large buckets, one solution is to randomize to a track but to store records singly in CKD format. This is particularly useful when manufacturers' software is available (as for example SEARCH ON KEY for IBM computers) to carry out the search automatically. Although a number of writers suggest that    a full-track bucket is always too large, they are talking of a bucket that has to be transferred as a whole into and out of main storage. The solution suggested above allows the very low synonym levels of a multi-record bucket — in this case a track — to be combined with the CKD format of individually stored records, which makes it possible to search the whole track and retrieve only the desired record. As very few records will not be on their home tracks, this procedure is extremely efficient. Fig. 6.8 shows how increased bucket size delays the onset of synonym occurrence in a well randomized file. The curves show divergence from the relationship  (for n records stored individually),(for records stored in buckets with a capacity of   ten records), and  (for buckets with a fifty-record capacity). They thus show the number of synonyms created, assuming a perfect randomizing algorithm, for various packing factors. Randomizing to buckets with a capacity of ten records markedly decreases the number of synonyms, and there is a further decrease if buckets with a capacity of fifty records are used. Appendix 5 provides extended synonym tables and curves for more precise work in this field. In general, the file designer will choose a bucket size and packing density that reduce the percentage of synonyms to an acceptable level, bearing in mind the increased retrieval times large bucket size can cause. As is made clear below, bucket size may also affect the algorithm chosen. Randomizing algorithm In choosing an algorithm, the file designer will aim to minimize the number of synonyms. The key type and format should be assessed, to decide on the occurrence and frequency of runs of keys. The range of key values, divided by the number of addresses to be generated (the calculation is shown on page 161), will indicate the potential improvement, over and above the synonym percentages predicted by the Poisson distribution, that can be aimed for. practical trials will indicate the success of any algorithms the designer selects, and this step in file design should never be omitted. For general guidance on choice of algorithm, the author has compared the number of accesses observed by Lum et al. in practical trials with the theoretically predicted number, for buckets holding five, ten, twenty and fifty records. The results of this comparison are shown in Fig. 6.9. As can be seen from the figure, for buckets holding five records division is not as effective as mid-square (which closely approximates the ‘theoretical’ figures) for packing densities above 0.7. For buckets holding ten records, division is superior up to a packing density of about 0.85, while for larger bucket sizes division is more efficient at all packing densities. In general, the success of a randomizing method is partly dependent on the technique used to store synonyms, and this will be discussed further in a later section of the chapter (see p. 184). However, it is fair to say that division is usually the most efficient technique if synonyms are to be handled by chaining or tagging, but that if they are to be stored using the consecutive spill technique, bucket size and packing density should also be considered before a decision on randomizing method is made. Before leaving randomizing algorithms, it should be made clear that the treatment of them here is based on the assumption that the file size, once created, can only be altered when the file is reorganized. Records can be added of course, but this will increase the packing density. There is a great deal of interest at present in developing hashing algorithms for files that may vary in size. This is usually termed dynamic hashing ; a particularly useful review of these techniques is given by Sachs-Davies et al., describing both extendible hashing , in which a set of buckets   is referenced via a directory, and linear hashing , which is genuinely a direct technique in that there is no directory. Both of these methods suffer from oscillations in performance associated with their mode of action, and neither performs as well as‘static’ randomization methods. A form of extendible hashing that does not suffer from oscillations and is claimed to outperform most indexing methods, was reported by Lomet He named the method bounded index exponential hashing ; it is not strictly a direct technique, and suffers from the drawback that the file packing density  is generally low, but offers many advantages for files which can grow at a rate that cannot be accommodated in a static system. Designers looking for examples of how to code randomizing algorithms should consult Snader, who gives examples of various functions coded in Fortran, Basic and Pascal; Morris, who gives Fortran code both for chaining and hashing; and Johnson and Cooper, who provide comprehensive coded examples in COBOL. File loading When a direct file is loaded for the first time, we may have little or no information about the individual records that make it up. However, it is still possible to keep the number of synonyms to a minimum. Records will be read into primary storage, their keys will be transformed by the algorithm being used, and if the address the algorithm produces is free they will be stored in that address on the direct access device. When a record turns out to be a synonym, there are two alternatives: these are to store the synonym at once, in which case the process is called a one-pass load , or to load it in two passes, which is called a two-pass load . A one-pass load will result in the creation of unnecessary synonyms, as shown in Fig. 6. 10. To avoid the creation of extra synonyms, the file has to be loaded in two passes. On the first pass, all the home records are loaded, but synonyms are not. On the second pass, all the synonyms are loaded. This process maximizes the number of home records in the file, and so maximizes the number of records that can be retrieved without further searching. All the calculations carried out so far have assumed that it is possible to allocate any number of records to a given address. This is implied in the calculations, as no allowance has been made to store the synonyms that arise in other free addresses. Instead, the number of synonyms has been calculated, but they have then been ignored by the mathematics, and so have not interfered with the ‘storage’ of other records. This is precisely the process that occurs during a two-pass load, as the synonyms are stored on the second pass. Although the calculations available in the literature have very largely assumed that direct files are loaded using two passes, there are a number of cases in which a one-pass load occurs in practice. These are: 1 If a simple one-pass load is used for the file. 2 Whenever records are added to an existing file, as both home and synonym records from the original load have already been stored; in this case the probability of an addition that is a potential home record being prevented from taking up its home position by a synonym that was loaded earlier is high. 3 In databases that offer the CALC option — as each record is loaded when it is added to the database, whether it is a home or synonym. To estimate the number of synonyms that occur during creation of a direct   file using a one-pass load, let us examine the result of storing n records at random in N addresses, on the assumption that each record has to be stored at once and each address can hold only one record. The first record will be stored in its calculated address. The second record has a probability of 1/N of becoming a synonym. The nth record has a probability (n — 1) /N of becoming a synonym. Summing this series of probabilities, and dividing by the number of records loaded, we obtain: For files of more than a few hundred records, ½N can be ignored. Thus the proportion of records stored as synonyms will be roughly equivalent to half the packing density in a file created using a single-pass load, and with single record buckets. The author has developed an iterative method of calculating the synonym percentages that would be expected as a result of loading buckets of various capacities to a range of packing densities. These results have been confirmed using simulation techniques, and are given in Table 6.5; they should be compared with Table 6.4. The divergence between the two loading techniques depends on packing density, and for single record buckets it is almost 10 per cent— one record in ten — for an 85 per cent packed file. Although the difference is less marked for multiple record buckets, it is still significant. To provide quick reference for the file designer the data in Table 6.5 has been plotted in Fig. 6.11. As the penalty that a one-pass load imposes in terms of extra synonyms is very quickly understood when it is shown visually, Fig. 6.12 compares the results of one-pass and two-pass loads for a number of bucket sizes. Storing and retrieving synonyms When a record cannot be placed in its home position, it must be stored at an address that can be located quickly. There are three widely used methods of doing this and we shall look at each in turn, assessing their advantages and drawbacks. 1 Consecutive spill (also called progressive overflow) The simplest method of storage is to place a synonym in the first vacant record position following its home address. (This applies in just the same way if records are being randomized to multiple records buckets. The record is stored in the first bucket with available space following the original home bucket.) This method of storage, in which there is no link or pointer to the synonym from its home bucket, is called consecutive spill or progressive overflow . Record retrieval takes place as follows. 1 Seek the home address. 2 Check whether the records or records in the home address have the required key. 3 If not, search the rest of the track. If the record is not found on the track, search the rest of the cylinder. Note that, if the key that has been requested is not present on the file, the unsuccessful search length is potentially limited only by the size of the file. Very few records will not find a place anywhere on the cylinder. Take for example a file that is 90 per cent packed, and can hold 250 records per cylinder. In this case the cylinder can be treated as a very large bucket. From Table 6.4, 99.86 per cent of records will be stored in their home cylinder and only 0.14 per cent will overflow on to another cylinder. As the packing density is usually lower than this and the number of records per cylinder greater, overflow from a cylinder is not usually a problem. It is shown in    Appendix 7 that, for a cylinder holding one hundred records and with other conditions as given above, the average retrieval time for all the records in the file will be 0.78R, where R is the rotation time of the device. This compares with 0.5R for a self-indexing file. A potential drawback of consecutive spill is that, while this method of handling synonyms can be effective in some circumstances to retrieve records that are held in a file, it is not a good method of dealing with records that are not in the file. As there is no way of knowing how many synonyms exist for any given home address, an unsuccessful search might require half the file to be scanned on average. The usual way to limit this search commitment is to place a synonym in any free position on its home cylinder, and in an independent area if no free space can be found in the cylinder. A second method is to note the longest search required to find a free storage position when synonyms are stored, and to limit searches to this length during retrieval. 2 Chaining The second method generally available for synonym handling is to chain together all the records that randomize to the same address. A chain takes the form shown in Fig. 6. 13. The home record storage area holds the address of the first synonym. This holds the address of the second synonym, and so on. A null link indicates the end of the chain. If it is found that the home record is not the one required, the link address is used. This points to the second record that randomized to the home address. The chain is followed until the desired record is located or the end of the chain is reached. It eliminates the need to search the file sequentially. The calculations involved in assessing the effect of chaining synonyms are complicated. For that reason they are given in detail in Appendix 6, The Effect of Synonym Storage Techniques on Search Times. Only the conclusions are discussed here. Records randomized to individual record positions, with 90 per cent packing and ten record positions per track, give the following figures: This shows that about one record in every 500 (0.2 per cent) will be part of a chain of six records. Of these, one-sixth (0.03 per cent) will be home records and an equal number will be first, second, third, fourth and fifth synonyms. At this packing density the average search time for a given record is 0.732R, where R is the device rotation time. When records are randomized to larger buckets — in this case we will examine ten record buckets — this will cause fairly long chains. Fig. 6.14 shows the pattern of record allocation for 80 per cent and 90 per cent packing. Buckets can hold ten records only, and any further records ‘allocated’ to a bucket will become part of a synonym chain. Fig. 6.14 shows that quite long chains must be expected. For 90 per cent packing, just more than one bucket in every 200 (0.53 per cent) will have a chain of eight or more synonyms. A more detailed analysis shows the following: As 91.4 per cent of records will be located in their home buckets, the advantage of having relatively few synonyms outweighs the disadvantage of there being some long chains. The average search time for 90 per cent packed records stored in ten record buckets is 0.654R. This figure is  a great deal better than that for the consecutive spill method of handling overflows, and even chained records randomized to individual addresses show an advantage over consecutive spill. A price has to be paid, however. To provide the links, an extra field has to be added to the home bucket or home record, and an extra field to each synonym. This effectively reduces the file packing, and may also cause fixed lengths to become variable in length. The last point could be put right, wasting more space, by adding a potential link field to every record. This might then be used when necessary, but be left empty in other cases. If the problem of providing space for link fields can be suitably handled, this method can offer considerable savings. 3 Tagging One difficulty when processing linked records is that, if a record in the centre of a chain is inadvertently overwritten, the end of the chain is ‘lost’. This can occur when adding records to the file. The third method of handling synonyms avoids this. It is called tagging . The technique used is to tag each synonym individually from the home address. Each tag will have to hold at least the information: This will mean that the few home addresses or home buckets which have large numbers of synonyms will have to allocate a lot of space for these tags. An example of the situation where there are five synonyms for a home record is shown in Fig. 6.15. The tag system uses a little less space than the chaining system, as there is no need for a terminal ‘link’ field at the end of the chain. However, all the extra space is required in the home records. This can make planning and file creation difficult. If these problems can be overcome, it offers two advantages that chained overflow record handling does not. Firstly, the file organization is more robust, as the accidental overwriting of a record only affects that record itself and not other members of a chain. Secondly, it is never necessary to carry out more than two searches to locate a record. These are: 1. Search home record — if record not found pick up address from tag; 2. Search the address shown in the tag. Using the example of a 90 per cent packed file with single-track buckets that can hold ten records: from Table 6.4, 91.4 per cent of records are located on their home tracks. Thus 8.6 per cent of records will require a full revolution of the home track, then a pick-up of the address required from a tag, then an average of R/2 while the record is located. The overall time required for the search will be: If the records are stored on a 25-track cylinder, Table 6.4 indicates that 0.14 per cent of records will overflow from the cylinder, i.e. will not be held in a 250-record bucket. Although the tags will point to the required record  addresses directly, accessing or retrieving these synonyms requires a head movement of at least one cylinder. Assume that the time to move from one cylinder to the next is the same as the rotation time of the device, which applies for some disk devices. This will mean an increase in the average access time of 0.0014R. Thus the total average access time is: Comparing the techniques in practice It might appear that chaining or tagging would always be preferable to the simpler system of storing records in the next available position. In practice they do not always turn out so much better, for a number of reasons. These include the following: 1 When records are stored in the next available position (i.e. using consecutive spill), no extra space is required for chain or tag fields. 2 Manufacturers' software is usually available for a SEARCH ON KEY operation throughout a whole cylinder. The search for a required record can start on the home track and continue until the record is located. There need be no holdup due to consecutive spill storage, however short. By comparison, following a chain or tag involves reading the link field, finding the key in it, picking up the address and searching for it. This will be carried out at primary storage speeds, but will still take time, often due to lost device revolutions. A home track and a track holding synonyms will appear as shown in Fig. 6. 16. Examining chained records first, tracks with spare space for the storage of synonyms often have room for a number of records, as is clear from Fig. 6. 14. Tracks that have overflowed during the original file load will not have any synonyms from other tracks present on them, which explains the likely track formats shown in Fig. 6.16. In some cases members of the chain may directly follow each other on a track holding synonyms. This could cause the loss of a whole revolution for each member of the chain, because the processing of the link field might take long enough to miss the start of the next record. This would happen as shown in Fig. 6.17. The tagged records case is straightforward. The tag is picked up at the end of a track and the synonym will also, on average, be at or near the end of a track, not in the middle. For this reason the time required to pick up the tagged record may be rather more than R/2. This depends on the manufacturers' software. Sometimes the start of a track has to be sensed before processing of the data stored on it can begin. This will lead to delays. In some systems, tag or chain link fields are stored at the start of a track, which will reduce delays caused for this reason. Lum et al. investigated the performance of a number of large files, and the author has analysed their results further. Fig. 6.18 shows a plot of Lum   et al.'s figures on the basis of average accesses per retrieval; it appears from the curves that consecutive spill is only useful for larger bucket sizes, but the figures are misleading, as the chained overflow was to a separate file area, necessitating head movement. Table 6.6 shows the very different results obtained when the actual time required for each retrieval, including head movements, is used to calculate break-even points, rather than average accesses per retrieval. Although most of the work reported in the literature has examined chaining to a separate overflow area, this is not the most effective way of using chaining. If records are stored in the next available position in the prime data area — the consecutive spill method — but a link field is provided from the home record or from the last synonym, this avoids unnecessary head movements and cuts down the search time required for the consecutive spill techniques. Table 6.7 compares the additional times added to an average record seek due to consecutive spill (for files using mid-square and division randomizing techniques), chained overflow in a separate area and chained overflow in the prime data area. The results tabulated here show that, for low packing densities, the most effective technique is generally chained overflow. At higher packing densities a separate overflow area may be useful for small bucket sizes, while chained overflow in the prime data area remains best for large bucket sizes. Choosing an overflow technique Tagging is superior to chaining whenever it is feasible (see Appendix 6 for an analysis). Very large numbers of synonyms for even a few home addresses can make it impractical, however. The distribution of records produced by a given algorithm should be checked to see that this will not occur. If it is unavoidable, chaining should be employed (assuming, of course, that the packing density is too high, and bucket size too small, to make consecutive spill attractive). In general, consecutive spill should be considered for low packing densities and/or very large bucket sizes. In the intermediate range of these factors, chaining or tagging records stored in the prime file area is the most efficient solution, while at packing densities in excess of unity a separate overflow area will be required. Although many writers recommend it, it is seldom worth using such a separate overflow area when the packing density is below unity. The packing density referred to here is measured in terms of the total number of records, both in the prime and overflow areas, divided by the prime data storage capacity only. Reducing the effect of synonyms on access times The analysis of the last section has shown that synonyms will slow up direct access to records on average. The average figure means little in this case, however. Access to home records only requires a single seek and search, just as in self-indexing files. This is increased for any synonym by at least half a revolution of the device. There are at least as many home records as synonyms in all circumstances (Table 6.5 shows that, even with 100 per cent packing and randomizing to individual record positions, 50 per cent of records are home records; with a two-pass load 63 per cent are home records). If all records are accessed equally frequently, the effect of any synonyms will be directly proportional to the figures in Table 6.4. However, this is a very unusual state of affairs. Normally, some records are accessed more frequently than others, and this tendency can be used to decrease average access time. The potential improvement in performance and ways of achieving that improvement after a two-pass load are discussed below. Patterns of record access A rule-of-thumb often used for updating is that ‘20 per cent of the records give rise to 80 per cent of the transactions’. It is certainly true that, in most applications, some records are processed far more frequently than others, and a number of commonly occurring distributions of update frequency are examined below. 1 The 80/20 arrangement . Assume that 20 per cent of the records are equally frequently accessed and give rise to 80 per cent of the total transactions. The remaining 80 per cent of the records are also equal in update frequency, but account in total for only 20 per cent of transactions. 2 A smooth curve of accesses in which some records are updated more regularly than others . The case shown in Fig. 6.20 is taken as an example of a very frequently met distribution (it is probable that the original 80/20 rule-of-thumb is based on a similar curve). 3 A random distribution . In this case a few records are updated very frequently, a few very seldom, and most records are updated more or less an average amount; the distribution is shown in Fig. 6.21. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of possible situations; the intention is to show how to tackle any distribution that occurs in practice. A limitation must be mentioned here. It is not possible to improve on equal access synonym handling in two cases. The first is when all records are equally likely to be accessed, i.e. there is no difference in access frequency to exploit. The second is when there is no permanent pattern. If a record that is updated or accessed frequently in one time period is likely not to be referenced at all in the next, any analysis breaks down and the equal access assumption is the best guide for design decisions. Usually there will be some random variation of this sort superposed on a relatively constant overall pattern. In examining the effect of the patterns defined above, random influences will be ignored. Each of the three cases will be examined for 90 per cent packed files, randomized to individual record positions and to a bucket that can hold ten records. 1 The 80/20 case When 20 per cent of the records generate 80 per cent of the accesses to a file, and the file is loaded in a random order, the percentage of accesses to synonyms will be the same as the percentage of synonyms; if the file is 90 per cent packed and randomized to individual record storage positions, accesses to synonyms will be 34.063 per cent of all accesses. If the 20 per cent of records that are most accessed are loaded first, the situation is quite different. As the file will be 90 per cent packed when it is fully loaded, 20 per cent of the records will occupy 18 per cent of the available storage addresses. This ‘mini’ file will have 8.483 per cent of synonyms, so that the 80 per cent of accesses made to these records will be split in the proportion of 91.517 home accesses to 8.483 synonym accesses. When the whole file has been loaded, it will contain 34.063 per cent of synonyms. However, as the first fifth of the file (20 per cent) only contained 8.483 per cent of synonyms, the four-fifths of the file loaded later must have a higher average number of synonyms than 34.063 to bring the overall average to that figure. Let that higher number be y . Then: Hence, the four fifths of the file loaded later contains 40.458 per cent of synonyms, and 59.542 per cent of home records; the 20 per cent of all accesses to the file that are to these records will therefore be split in this proportion. The total accesses to home and synonym records will thus be as follows: By loading in access frequency order, the accesses to synonym records — and these are the records that slow up the average retrieval times of the file — have been cut from 34.063 per cent to 14.878 per cent. This reduces the effect of the synonyms to a figure that could have been achieved by choosing an initial packing density of just over 33 per cent for the file — but this file is 90 per cent packed. Fig. 6. 19 shows the improvement that can be achieved in 80/20 type files — those in which 80 per cent of the accesses are to 20 per cent of the records — for buckets holding one, two, three and four records over a wide range of   packing densities, and Table 6.8 provides figures for a number of bucket sizes and packing densities. These curves and figures apply only to the 80/20 case. A general expression to assess the potential improvement that access frequency loading can provide for any case in which A per cent of records account for B per cent of accesses is derived below. It should be made clear both that (A + B) does not need to add up to 100 — it is an unfortunate chance that the 80/20 or 90/10 ‘rules’ are so well known — and that access frequency loading will only be of benefit when A is less than B. If A were greater than B, meaning that the less active records were loaded first, file access times would be poorer than those of randomly loaded files! The following symbols will be use in the derivation: A is used for the per cent of records loaded first. B is used for the per cent of accesses made to A (in total). α is used for packing density. r is used for bucket capacity: S is used for synonym per cent. Suffices of S are equations that will be evaluated in any given case to give a packing density, followed by r to indicate bucket size, so that the correct synonym percentage can be calculated or looked up. The percentage of synonyms when A per cent of the file has been loaded is  As these records have given rise to B per cent of accesses, the percentage of references to synonyms from these records will be  After the remaining records have been loaded, the percentage of synonyms in the whole file will be . Of these: had been loaded previously so: have arisen from (100 — A) per cent of the records, and the percentage of synonyms in these later records is: These records will give rise to (100 — B) per cent of the total accesses to the file. Thus the percentage of references to synonyms from these later loaded records will be: This simplifies to: Combining equations (6. 19) and (6.20), the total accesses to synonyms will now be: For the case in which A = B this equation simplifies to , as would be expected. As , which is approximately true for large values of r , the value of equation (6.20) tends to  This compares with the value  if records are stored in random order. Division of equation (6.22) by  to show the improvement expected after access frequency loading, yields (100 — B) /(100 — A), i.e. the general equation of which the value ⅓ for the 80/20 case is an example. When A per cent of records that give rise to B per cent of accesses is loaded first, the improvement obtained tends to (100 — B) /(100 — A) as . Table 6.8 shows the percentage of accesses to synonyms to be expected for various bucket sizes, in the 80/20 case. Many situations cannot be handled on the basis of ‘A per cent of records give rise to B per cent of accesses’. For this reason two other common situations are analysed here. 2 A smooth access curve Fig. 6.20 shows a histogram of records divided into nine groups of equal numbers. The most active group accounts for 43 per cent of accesses, the least active for 1 per cent. It is no longer enough to divide the records into two groups, and the analysis has been carried out on the nine separate groups of records responsible for 10 per cent, 20 per cent , 30 per cent …, 90 per cent packing. As the calculations required in this case are complex, they have been set out in Appendix 8. The results show that a 90 per cent packed file of this type loaded in access frequency order into single record buckets will achieve a   reduction from 34.06 down to 16.63 per cent references to synonyms. If instead the file is loaded into ten-record buckets, the reduction is from 8.59 per cent down to 1.36 per cent. 3 A random distribution If the records are very variable in their number of accesses, but this variation is distributed about a mean value, a curve such as that in Fig. 6.21 occurs. There is an average number of accesses during a specified period of about sixty-five. However, a small group of records have been accessed over 120 times, and another small group less than ten times. To analyse this, the   frequency curve in Fig. 6.22 (case 3) is constructed relating the percentage of accesses to the file to the percentage of records loaded at any cumulative percentage of records loaded, using the methods shown in Appendix 8. From the case 3 curve we can decide on the percentage of accesses corresponding to the 10–90 per cent packing points, i.e. 11.1 per cent, 22.2 per cent ,…of records. This can be used to calculate the required information; it turns out that the improvements that can be achieved by access frequency loading are to reduce accesses to synonyms from 34.06 per cent to 28.4 per cent for single — record buckets, and from 8.59 per cent to 4.90 per cent for ten-record buckets. Assessment of possible improvement The cumulative frequency curves for all three cases analysed earlier are shown in Fig. 6.22. The more to the left of and above the dashed straight line a curve is, the more potential exists for improvement. This can be seen by comparing the three cases discussed above with each other, and with the data for the 90/10 case, that has been included for comparison. If in doubt as to the possible use of this technique, the user should collect enough data to plot a curve of this type. A visual check will indicate whether improvement can be expected, and will give some indication of its magnitude. In general terms, however, if there is a consistent access frequency pattern, this type of load will be of benefit. Even in the third case analysed above, the use of an access frequency load is equivalent to reducing the packing density of the file by nearly 20 per cent, or doubling the bucket size. This improvement can be achieved by collecting and using access data as explained on page 399. Additions to access frequency loaded files Additions to a file set up by loading in access frequency order will have a disproportionate effect on file access time; this is because they will be of at least average activity and often more, as new records tend to be very active, but are loaded into a densely packed file. A high proportion of them will be synonyms — if the file is 85 per cent packed, for example, 17 in every 20 would be expected to be synonyms — and this will lead to rapid deterioration of the file access speed. The key figure here is the number of seeks per access . This will rise markedly as additions are made, and should be monitored frequently. The deterioration to be expected has been analysed by the author, and results for the 80/20 case are given here. Tables 6.9(a) and (b) shows the result of access frequency loading up to 20 per cent, 30 per cent , 40 per cent , 50 per cent , 60 per cent , 70 per cent , 80 per cent and 90 per cent packing, followed by additions of records of average activity until the file is 100 per cent loaded. The results are tabulated for ten-record buckets and single-record positions, and the rapid deterioration in both cases is very clear. Fig. 6.23 shows the results of additions of average access frequency to an access frequency loaded file. The dashed curves trace the results of a full access frequency load to 100 per cent packing, while the unbroken curves show the effect of adding records of average activity from the packing densities set into each curve. In reality, as pointed out above, these curves are likely to represent a ‘best’ case, as additions to a file are usually new customers, products, personnel, etc. and tend to be highly active, while they also have a high probability of being synonyms. Fig. 6.24 superposes the deterioration of access frequency loaded 90/10 files as a result of loading additional records in random order, on to an 80/20 file loaded in the same way. The dashed and dotted curves do not intersect, which makes it clear that the rate of deterioration caused by adding records of average activity to an access frequency loaded file is only dependent on the starting point of the random load, and not on the particular file access situation, such as 90/10, 85/25, etc. The situation has been explored in detail by the author, and Figs 6.25 and 6.26 are taken from that paper. They provide the file designer with reference charts for buckets of size one and ten records, and can be used to predict the rates of deterioration of any access frequency loaded file using the given bucket sizes. The unbroken curves show the improvements due to loading files with asymmetries in access frequency of 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, 90/10 and, for single-record buckets, 99/5. These are provided for convenience, but the designer can use the charts from any point, and the slope of the broken lines indicates the rate of deterioration to be expected. Similar curves for buckets holding 2, 3, 4 and 5 records are given in Appendix 1. The figures against the broken lines correspond to the packing percentages from which a 90/10 case file has received random additions. The broken curve shows the percentages of access to synonyms as more random additions are made, demonstrating how rapid the degradation is. In this section we have seen that it is usually possible to reduce the number of accesses to synonyms by loading first the records most frequently accessed. In cases where a small number of records is accessed very   frequently, the saving is marked, and may even be dramatic. When a file is first set up it may not be possible to load in most frequently accessed order. The savings that can be made usually justify the collection of statistics during the life of the file, and some ways of arranging this are described in the next section. 6.7 Practical considerations in setting up direct files Preparing a device for a direct file Self-indexed files will need little or no prior formatting of the direct access device on which they are to be stored. It is essential to ensure that every storage position has been initialized, or at least to remove any data remaining from previous uses of the device. In every other respect the file load will be a normal — and sequential — operation, except that some positions may be left vacant to retain the address/key relationship. When files are randomly organized using an algorithm, the device must  first be initialized to remove all prior data. If this were not done, data from previous files might still be present in addresses to which records were not allocated. If the records are to be stored in full track buckets, no formatting is required as the track address is available at all times. However, if the records are to be stored in individual address positions, the addresses and record storage positions have to be created before the file is loaded. This applies both for single-record positions and for buckets that are only part of a track in size. Some manufacturers provide pre-formatted buckets of various sizes on a track. In this case the user only needs to specify the bucket size required from the alternatives provided, as the formatting and addressing have already been carried out by the manufacturer. However, it is then often necessary to read a whole bucket into primary storage at a time; it is not possible to search the bucket and read in only the required record, but this does not apply if a device such as ICL's CAFS-ISP is available to speed up the search. Some manufacturers provide a capacity record at the start of a track, used to indicate whether space remains on the track during loading. If this is not provided, the user will need to set up an equivalent record. The load process will be: 1 Decide on the bucket size required. 2 Initialize the file area on the direct access device. 3 Pre-format the file area by setting up dummy records of individual record or bucket size, to provide all the addresses within the range that the address algorithm can generate. 4 Load the file. File statistics In order to get the best possible performance from a direct file, information is required. Run times will give an indication that reorganization is due; access data will allow more efficient processing; service times will indicate the effect of user demand or the need for file reorganization; a log of the number of sequential processing runs required may point to the use of ancillary files or a different file organization technique. We shall look at each of these in turn. Run times The basic criterion for the need to reorganize a direct file is that the number of seeks per access has risen appreciably. When a direct file is being processed on its own, the run times for the file will point to this. A predetermined figure should be set, and when this is reached the file should be reorganized. This situation may come about in several ways. First, the file may be growing. If new records are added faster than old records are deleted, the packing of the file will get higher; as we saw earlier in the chapter, this will cause more synonyms. Second, the randomizing algorithm  may be becoming less useful due to some pattern in new record keys. Third, many of the new records will have become synonyms; if they are relatively frequently accessed this may cause a marked increase in run times. Van der Pool described what he called the ‘ageing’ process in direct files, pointing out that performance degrades over time due to additions, even if the packing density does not change. Usually a direct file will be one of a number of files being processed at any time. In this case the manufacturer's operating system may be used to keep track of the file run-time. It is helpful to keep a count of references to home and synonym records. This can be held in main storage during processing and be printed out on the log or stored in a file label area at the end of the run. A figure for the ratio of seeks required per access should be specified on the basis of the design criteria used, and the file should be reorganized when this figure is exceeded. Access data It was shown on page 195 that knowing how frequently a record is accessed can lead to reduced seek times. Usually we do not have this information when a file is set up. There are two ways in which it can be provided for in later reorganizations of the file. The first is to have a count field in each record, and increment it each time the record is accessed. This has the advantage that records can be sorted into descending count order for loading during reorganization. When records are being updated during the run, and so have to be written back on to the device after they have been read into main storage, this method involves no loss of time. However, if records are only being referred to, the position is different. A half-revolution would be lost for every record, just to update the count field. In this case a second method of gathering access data is preferable. It is to set up an ancillary file with the records in sequential key order and each record consisting only of a count field. This file will be very small and, if indexed, it will usually match the access speed of a larger direct file because it can be held on a single cylinder of disk, with its index in main storage. When the master file is to be reorganized, this ancillary file will be sorted into descending count order, and the records are read from the old direct file and loaded on to the new in this order. The resulting master file will be in access frequency order. Access data is only useful when records remain relatively constant in their activity. This often happens, as large customers will always remain more ‘active’ than small customers, and some lines of stock are consistently required more frequently than others. In other cases it is not true; for example, a flight will be available in an airline booking system long before it takes place. At first, bookings will be few, then they will increase, and after the flight date the record will vanish. Statistics of overall popularity of flights will help in planning, but the profile of interest in any one flight will vary with time. However, some flights will naturally be more likely to be accessed than others. A Boeing 747 flight between London and New York will always be a candidate for a home position. A DC9 or BAC 111 cannot hold so many passengers and would tend to be loaded later. Naturally, if a small aircraft is overbooked consistently, it might rate early loading. In that case, it would also be likely to merit a larger aircraft. In some cases no clear pattern emerges. Then it may not be possible to load records in any predetermined order, and lower packing densities and changes in bucket size or type of algorithm may be needed to give an acceptable performance. Service times The access times considered in this chapter have been simply the time taken to position the device access mechanism to read or write a selected record. In practice this is not complete, since two additional times need to be considered in order to obtain the true picture. The first of these is the data transfer time . This depends mainly on the size of the record and the operating speeds of the direct access device in question. For example if the records took up half a track on a device with a rotation time of 25 ms (2400 rpm) then the data transfer would take about 12.5 ms. The second is the time taken from the moment a record is requested by the program to the time when accessing and transfer takes place, known as wait time or queue time . This may be zero, though in multi-programming or multi-tasking it is likely to be finite. For example, if the direct file were being used by an on-line system there could be several concurrent terminal tasks at any one time using the file, and queues would then develop. Indeed, some operating systems are geared to handling queues by offering the user a choice of queuing algorithm. If the accesses on a file are completely random, it is often sensible to sort the accesses into cylinder address sequence and minimize individual seek times. Input or output requests to a file are queued by the operating system and then sorted into sequence before any operations commence. Updating of a direct file by sorting a batch of update records into their physical order after using the algorithm, and so avoiding the typical random sequence of seeks, can provide rapid ‘sequential’ batch updating. This has been discussed by Nijssen. Type of processing Some files may be predominantly processed directly, but occasionally be processed sequentially. If a file is self-indexed, this presents no problem. If it has been randomized, then the process has to be reversed. A list of keys in sequential order is fed into the program and the keys are transformed into addresses in the usual way. Every synonym will need to be accessed, so no benefit will be derived from the order in which the records were loaded. This may mean that a file which operates well under normal conditions, i.e. many home records being accessed but few synonyms, may take a relatively long time to process sequentially. In such a case it can pay to set up an ancillary file when the file is loaded. This will be a sequential or indexed-sequential file, in key order, with the actual device address of each record as the data. This actual address will be identical with the key as transformed by the algorithm for home records, but will be different for synonyms, as the ancillary file used will allow all the records to be reached in a single seek, as if the file were self-indexed. The use of such a file will eliminate extra searching for synonyms and may save a fair bit of time. It will need to be updated whenever the direct file is updated if the file is very volatile, and this may require the two files to be on-line together. If there are relatively few additions it may be updated in batch mode later. This latter case will favour the use of a sequential magnetic tape file. The former will tend to require an indexed sequential file on a direct access device. Additions and deletions Precautions have to be taken to avoid the possibility of excessively long search times or of failure to retrieve records held in a direct file. When a file has been newly loaded, a search for any record will allow it to be retrieved whether it is a home or a synonym record. Additions or deletions can change this situation. An addition may nut he able to take up its home address, because it is already occupied by a synonym from some other address. Deletion of a home record may mean that, even though the home position is now free, a number of other records that originally randomized to that address are held as synonyms. Either of these cases may give the appearance that no home record exists for this address, and this situation will thus cause a ‘no record found’ error to be given, even though the desired record is in the file. Thus, if the consecutive-spill method of handling synonyms has been used, a search may still be necessary even if no home record is detected when the home position is searched. The precautions that should be taken to avoid this situation were set out in the section on consecutive spill, page 186. If the chaining method is used, the lack of a home record will lead to the inability to retrieve any record further along the chain. Only the tagging method of handling synonyms is unaffected. To avoid these problems, addition and deletion algorithms will have to ensure that at least one home record remains in any bucket to which any records randomize. When a record is added, this will involve storing it in its home address unless a home record is already in that address; a synonym from some other address would have to be moved to make way for it. When a home record is deleted, any synonym that is stored elsewhere, or the first if there are more than one, should be placed in the home address to take the  place of the original home record. This is particularly important if records This system, which is discussed in detail by Montgomery and Wallace leads to a fairly high number of accesses required to retrieve records from a well-aged file , i.e. one that has had a large number of additions or deletions since it was last loaded. A stricter file housekeeping discipline, requiring that every home record possible is stored in home addresses, was analysed theoretically by Johnson. This requires that when a record is added to the file it is stored in its home bucket if any record that is a synonym is at present in the home bucket, and that if space becomes available in a bucket, any synonym that randomizes to the bucket in which space is now available is moved into the home bucket. The predictions made by Johnson were tested by simulation studies, which showed that even for a 100 per cent packed file, if the discipline he recommended is adhered to, the average number of accesses can be kept down to 1.5 per retrieval, and for larger bucket sizes this is reduced to around 1.25. Despite the extra work involved in moving records about to ensure that all possible records are held in their home addresses, compared with the less restrictive requirement of at least one home record discussed earlier, this stricter file housekeeping pays off when retrievals outnumber additions and deletions. This is the usual case, but if it turns out that a particular file is very volatile the less restrictive system should be used. The most appropriate bucket size The optimum bucket size to minimize the time taken by operations carried out on a file depends on the nature of the operation. When retrievals and updating predominate, which is the usual situation, the optimum bucket size is as small as possible. This means a single sector for sector-oriented devices, or one record per bucket in systems that allow the user to choose any bucket size within the capacity of the device. This does not invalidate the earlier comment that a full-track bucket is advantageous, so long as records are randomized to a full track but stored in single-record format on the track. If additions and deletions are more numerous than retrievals and updates, it turns out that the larger the proportion of additions, the larger the bucket size that provides the minimum number of accesses per reference to the file. This is a result of the very much larger number of accesses required to find spare space for an addition, in comparison with those required to locate a record already in the file. (This only applies for files that are relatively fully loaded; a 50 per cent packed file would require approximately equal numbers of accesses for addition and reference.) However, even if additions make up most of the processing carried out on the file, it appears that bucket sizes small in comparison with a full track give optimal results. The full-track bucket, but single-record storage, remains a good option in this case. Conclusion Direct files have been used less than might be expected in data processing. There is certainly a security problem, in that arranging for security and integrity of data is more complex by comparison with sequential files and this, coupled with their poor performance for sequential applications, makes it obvious why they are not used if a sequential file is appropriate. It is equally true that they are not as suitable for a truly mixed sequential-direct application as indexed sequential files. However, for enquiry systems with no sequential requirement, or when that requirement is minimal, a well-designed direct file will outperform a well-designed indexed-sequential file, often very substantially. The probable reason that indexed sequential files are so often used when direct files would perform better is the ready availability of software. Direct files require extensive design work, because every file and every algorithm will differ slightly from every other. This means that manufacturers' software can only provide the more basic requirements such as GET and PUT macros and record-formatting software. Randomizing algorithms are sometimes provided, but it is generally wise for the user to allocate and test them for each file on an individual basis. This chapter has shown the steps that can be taken to ensure that a direct file is optimized, and if the file designer follows the rules laid down here, good results should be obtained in almost any situation. The choice between indexed sequential and direct files is examined in Chapter 9, and security of direct files in Chapter 10. Revision questions 1 What is meant by self-indexing files?

ACA ACA-FPG-002 5.63 "INDEXED SEQUENTIAL FILES 7.1 Introduction Sequential processing of data files makes up a large proportion of data processing. However, there is often a need to refer to sequential files just to answer one or relatively few enquiries. Such a need could be met by processing the whole file sequentially and looking for the records required, but this would be very inefficient. If the file is large the query may take some time to answer; meanwhile the computer is occupied processing unwanted records rather than doing useful work. A second technique that greatly improves the speed of searching a sequential file is to use a logarithmic search. This method has been described in Chapter 5 on sequential files (see p. 119). It is very useful for a few enquiries but cannot handle a large number, as a series of storage device movements is involved in each search. Although technically possible on magnetic tape, logarithmic searches are too slow to be economic, so they are normally only considered for direct access devices. When the number of enquiries gets too large for a logarithmic search, or even some form of interpolation search, an indexing technique can be used to retrieve records more quickly. The simplest form of index is one that holds the address of every record. This is called full indexing and provides a very rapid means of locating any given record. If the main file is large this index too will be large and there will be problems due to its size. For this reason one or more indexes may be used in a hierarchy, with the lowest-level index pointing to records while higher-level indices point to the index next below them. Because of the way in which direct access devices operate, it is not normally necessary or desirable for the lowest-level index to point to every record. Usually one record per track (IBM) or bucket (ICL) has an entry in the index. This is sometimes called partial indexing . A sequential data file that is indexed is called an indexed sequential file . The facilities provided by this type of file usually include: 1 Rapid direct retrieval of records by the use of indexes; 2 Addition of records and subsequent sequential processing of them by the provision of overflow areas; 3 Deletion of records; 4 Statistics on the state of the file, giving warning when reorganization is necessary. Properly used, such a file provides an excellent compromise between the extremes of sequential processing with very rare enquiries that is best handled by sequential files, and direct processing with very infrequent sequential processing, for which direct files are most suitable. It is not as efficient as either in their own fields, but performs very much better than they can in a situation where a significant enquiry facility is necessary and where the data is frequently processed sequentially. The precautions needed to ensure that such a file performs satisfactorily are discussed in the main body of this chapter. 7.2 File structure An indexed sequential file generally has the following components. 1 A data storage area : this may include some unused space to allow for additions embedded in the data. It may also incorporate the lowest-level index elements. 2 A separate index or indexes : any enquiry will reference this index first; it will direct the enquiry to the part of the data file in which the desired record is stored. 3 An optional separate overflow area : the decision as to whether such an overflow area is required, and how best to allow for it, is considered later in this chapter. These parts of the file are interrelated as shown in Fig. 7.1. 7.3 Indexes General principles of indexing It was stated above that full indexing — knowing the position of a record on a track — is seldom useful, because it does not usually speed up the search for that record. The read-write head reaches any track at a time which is ‘random’ in the sense that it is not possible to tell which part of the track will be reached first. This means that, even if a given address is known, it will be reached no more quickly than if only the track on which the record is stored is known. This may not always hold good. It is a result of the physical make-up of present access devices. The main case in which full indexing is useful is that in which individual records take up a whole track (in IBM terminology) or sufficient buckets or sectors (eight, fifteen or twenty-five in ICL 2900 series terms, depending on the disk in question) to fill a track completely. The search time can be overlapped by using rotational position sensing, however (see Chapter 2), and in this case the ‘wasted’ time can be used by some other operation or program. In this case, knowing the address of the individual record may be useful. As most of the considerations discussed below do not depend on whether indexing is full or partial, the reader should assume from now on that partial indexing is being discussed. Exceptions will be pointed out as they arise. All the common direct access devices, whether disk, semiconductor ‘disk’ or mass storage device, have a track concept that is important in deciding on the best arrangement of indexes. It is not possible to control the part of an index track that is read first. This means that, on average, half a revolution of the device is necessary before the desired entry is found. If the software writers arranged that the start of the track has to be detected before the search begins, this becomes a full revolution; this is made up of half a track to locate the start, and half a track for the search. When the desired entry is not on that track, these search figures become a full revolution and one-and-a-half revolutions respectively before it is clear that the record is not on the track, and the search must continue on a further track. In designing a hierarchy of indexes, these figures are very useful. The following calculations assume that indexes are stored on a direct access device. Let I 1 and I 2 both be higher-level indexes, and of these let index I 1 be the higher-level index, pointing to index I 2 . Then the time to locate an address in I 2 will be: I 1 will only be created when it is quicker to search I 1 and then the track to   which it points in I 2 , than to carry out an average length search of I 2 . Assume first that I 2 is one track or less in extent. In this case a search will take R/2 on average, when the time of rotation of the device is R. Each additional track will add a further R/2 to this. In the case where the start of the first index track searched has to be located before the search begins, a single-track index will require an average search time of R, but each additional track will again only add R/2. Total sequential search times for these cases are shown in Fig. 7.2. When a higher-level index is first added, it can be expected to be less than one track in size. A search will therefore take the minimum time shown in Fig. 7.2. The higher-level index will point directly to the required track of the lower-level index, so this will also require the minimum search time. The break-even point is therefore two tracks if there is no requirement to seek the start of the track, or three tracks if there is. This shows that as soon as some part of a further track (over and above two or three respectively) is necessary for I 2 , a higher-level index I 1 should be created. This process is repeated each time the highest-level index existing at that time requires a third or fourth track to be added. The above discussion is based on a sequential search for index I 1 . An alternative is to search using the logarithmic technique. This is not significant for less than three tracks, as it is effectively the same as a sequential search for one or two tracks. In the three-track case it is possible to search the centre track first. This must be a complete search to ensure that if the desired record is on the track it is found. If the record is not on the centre track the first or last track will be searched, depending on a comparison of the key being looked for with the highest key on the track. This will take R (or 3R/2 if the start of the track has to be detected first) for the centre track, and R/2 for the other track searched. There is a ⅓ chance that the desired record is on the centre track, and this brings the average search time to (7/6) R (or (10/6) R where the track start has to be located). These figures are similar to those for sequential searching, although the lower one is slightly better. The logarithmic technique is not normally used because it requires an extra search for every power-of-two increase in the number of records, while a higher-level index only needs to be built when an index has reached three or four tracks in size. This means that an extra search will be added only for every additional (2n + 1) or (3n + 1) records, where n is the number of records per track. This can never be inferior to a logarithmic search (as n cannot be less than one) and is usually far superior. The effect is shown in Fig. 7.2 for several values of n . A number of types of index are in common use, and three of the most important are reviewed below. Types of index Balanced tree indexing Indexes are said to be of order e when there are e records per index entry, and of height h, where there are h levels of the index. A tree index is one in which the top level of the index, which is the one consulted first in a search for a record, points to lower levels of the index. This top level of the tree is often described as the root index of the tree, while the lower-level index items are equivalent to the branches of the tree, and the records are often called leaves or nodes . A balanced tree is one in which any record can be retrieved in a number of steps s or s — 1, that is the path length to the record varies by no more than one step. The balanced tree index shown in Fig. 7.3(a) is made up of a series of index levels, each pointing to the level below it. The records and the index entries are grouped into twos, so e = 2 and this is described as a tree of order 2 and height 4. When a record is added it is necessary to use an overflow area, as the data areas are already full. The added records have to be indexed, which requires a second index entry for each ‘track’ of the data file. By track here, is meant e records. The arrangement of the file after a number of additions is shown in Fig. 7.3(b). This type of index is used in the Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) that has been available on IBM mainframe computer   systems since the late sixties, and is now available on some microcomputers. The balanced tree index allows for deletions without difficulty, because records are tagged but not removed, so that no data manipulation is required. In some systems, tagged records are removed if they are pushed into overflow; this depends on decisions taken by the software writers. However, allowing for additions by providing areas that are logically extensions of the prime data tracks, rather than just physically, has made it necessary to double the size of the lowest-level index, with separate entries for records on the prime data and overflow tracks. Direct-link balanced trees A second indexing technique, that treats additions as part of the prime data track, is the direct-link balanced tree. This method of indexing was used on the IBM 1400 series computers — the control sequential method — and is at present in use with ICL's 2900 series. A direct-link balanced tree index would also look just as in Fig. 7.3(a) before additions. However, after additions it would appear as in Fig. 7.4. This technique is most effective for very volatile files, as the additions change the keys in indexes but do not cause alteration of prime data tracks. This means that additions are made quickly, but sequential retrievals suffer. McDonnell and Montgomery have shown that this technique is as good as the other balanced tree method for direct retrieval. Both methods suffer from the problem that performance of the file degrades as additions are made, and in consequence they both require that the file should be reorganized at regular intervals. In order to combat this problem, a number of other indexing methods have been developed. B-trees Bayer, McCreight and Kaufman proposed the B-tree. In this type of index, there are always more pointers than index items:. The order of the B-tree is said to be one more than the maximum number of keys per index block. A modified form of B-tree is used in IBM's VSAM files, to be discussed later in the chapter. Indirectly, B-trees are also used in IBM's DB/2 relational database system. Using the same data as before, a B-tree has been set up. Here,e = 2, so the order is 3. This is very low, and would never be used in practice, but it allows an example to be shown in a compact diagram. The minimum number of keys per block has to be e/2, which in this case is one (1). The keys given in the index entries do not have to be actual keys. Usually, they are intermediate values to allow for later additions. Fig. 7.5(a) shows the same set of keys as in Fig. 7.3(a), but stored in a B-tree. Note that they are now in groups nf 1 or 2. The number of index levels here is the same as in Fig. 7.3(a) — that is, the height is again 4 — but there is much more room for additions. The way in which additions are handled is shown in Fig. 7.5(b); the same additions have  been made, but have resulted in index and data block splitting, so that no records are in ‘overflow’. This prime data/index structure can continue to propagate itself as needed. However, it takes much longer to add records that cause splitting, so the addition versus update-only figures are very important in assessing the efficiency of a B-tree. A volatile file with relatively little processing might be better handled by a balanced tree index. VSAM uses a modified form of B-tree, so that the number of keys and pointers is the same, and index entries are greater than or equal to the keys pointed to rather than taking some intermediate value. The additions to this B-tree have had no effect on the index entries on the left-hand side of the tree, but have led to several changes to the right-hand index entries. In order to examine this further, let us look at another case. Fig. 7.6 shows an example of a B-tree of order 5. In this case the maximum number of keys per block is four (e), and the minimum is 2 (e/2). Note that the top level index may have as few as one. Choice of index technique It is clear that the changes to the indexes caused by even a very few additions mean a great deal of reading and writing of data into the index areas on disk. This is a definite weakness of the B-tree. It is counterbalanced by the ability of the structure to accept very large numbers of additions — given sufficient space, the structure can grow in an unlimited fashion. We therefore have a choice between index types that is affected by the use to which the file is put. In Table 7.1 the three methods are compared, scoring 1 for the best of the three, 2 for the second, and 3 for the worst. Bradley has discussed index design and optimization in some detail. Montgomery describes the nary tree method of indexing, and compares it with hashing of keys (discussed later in the chapter, see p. 230). Rathmann, in a paper particularly concerned with optical disks, compares the balanced tree method with the trie index technique, as did Severance. A trie index is particularly useful when keys are of varying sizes, and the path of a search at any point of the tree depends on a part of the key rather than its full value. As most available file organization techniques use the methods discussed earlier, rather than nary trees or trie indexes, they will not be discussed further here, but a full description of tries is given by Knuth. Index position The start of any direct search, and the first step in any sequential run, is a search of the higher-level indexes. The process, for direct reference, is as follows: Seek the highest-level index (an average head movement) Search the high-level indexes (a variable search time) Seek the data cylinder (an average head movement) Search the low-level index (a single track search time) Search the prime data track (a single track search time) Search the overflow area (a variable search time). As this is time-consuming, particularly in the case of direct reference, the file designer will aim to minimize it. The first high-level index set up by the software is called the cylinder index in ISAM files, or the seek area index in some ICL 2900 series systems. This index has an entry for each data cylinder of the file indicating the highest key on the cylinder. Ideally, the file designer will aim to reduce the time taken to reference this index; however, when it exceeds a certain threshold value described earlier, a master index , which has one entry for each track of the cylinder index, can be created to reduce the total search time as described above. IBM systems usually provide the software to create up to five higher-level indexes automatically in this way if the user specifies MSTIND = YES. If two or more higher-level indexes exist, each of them may be handled using a different one of the techniques described below aimed at reducing index search time, depending on their size. 1 To hold all or part of the index in main storage  This will avoid the need for a head movement to the index and can yield very marked savings. If the entire index is in main storage, the correct cylinder to search is located in well under a millisecond. This compares with head movement times that are usually orders of magnitude greater, and the direct access throughput is often roughly doubled if this technique is used. Unless the file is small or main storage is very large, the cylinder index size may exceed the space available for it. In this case IBM software allows the user to store an exact sub-multiple of the index in main storage, i.e. one half, one third, etc. When this applies, the average seek time will be reduced to a half, two thirds, etc., of average head movement time, as the information will be available in main storage — so saving a seek — in an equivalent proportion of cases. If, because of the size of the cylinder index, only a higher-level index than the cylinder index can be held in main storage, a 20–50 per cent improvement over the performance of the file when the master index is stored on disk can still be achieved. 2 To hold the higher-level indexes on fast devices  Head movement times for fixed-head disks or semiconductor ‘disks’ are much shorter on average than those of standard disks. It is very good practice to store high-level indexes on these devices, so that every direct reference is reduced by the difference in timing. When the device is dedicated to this file the benefits can be very marked, since the index cylinder on the fast device is available without head movement at all times; if IBM 3340, 3350 or similar devices that offer some fixed-head capacity are available, these indexes can be held in the fixed-head area. If the file is held on a mass storage device, location of higher-level indexes on a disk will make a very significant contribution to reducing run times. 3 Storage on a separate device  If no faster device is available it is often beneficial to use a separate device of the same sort. This can be most effective if this device can be dedicated to the file, but is still useful in normal multi-programming; there is certain to be constant arm movement if the file and its high-level indexes are stored on the same device, while this is less likely if they are on separate devices. 4 positioning on a device that also holds the data  When no separate device is available, the optimal position for the cylinder index should be determined. This has been investigated in great detail elsewhere, and the guidelines may be summarized as follows: a) If nothing is known about the distribution of hits in the file, the cylinder index should be placed in the centre of the file area. In a multi-pack file this will be the centre of one of the packs that is completely dedicated to the file. b) If, in a multi-pack file, the only information about hits is the relative number per pack or area, the index should be placed in the centre of the pack or area with the lowest hit density. c) If the hit density across a file area or areas is known, the index should be placed in the centre of the highest peak of hits on the least active pack used by the file. The objective of these guidelines is to place the cylinder index on the file cylinder that is of lowest possible activity, in such a position that the majority of head movements away from the index will be short. This allows movement back to the index to be rapid. Past practice has often been to allocate the cylinder index to a cylinder preceding or following the file area. This is never the best solution; as pointed out above, the centre of the file is the logical position if nothing is known about hit pattern. Fig. 7.7 summarizes the rules for placement of the cylinder index if it is to be situated in the main file area. Alternative indexing techniques There have been a number of suggestions for alternatives to the lowest-level index of indexed sequential files. Ghosh and Senko put forward an interpolation search in place of the track or lowest-level index, and showed that for normal key distributions it would improve the direct retrieval performance of IS files. In addition, this measure gives a potentially better packing density than conventional indexing techniques. Mullin suggested the use of hashing, rather than indexing, for the lowest-level index. As he makes clear, this is only of benefit when the average number of records that has overflowed from a track is two or more. This limits the possible uses of such a technique to very active files that the user does not wish to reorganize frequently. 7.4 Additions Most indexed sequential file software allows for additions to be made to the file without reorganizing it. The provision of space for additions is an optional feature. If no additions are expected, ii is not necessary to leave space for that purpose. When additions are expected, two techniques are used to store those additions so that they are available for both sequential and direct access. The first is embedded overflow . In this case, space is left unused in the main data area when the file is created, and additions are located on the same cylinder (IBM) or seek area (ICL) that they would have occupied if they had been part of the file when it was created. In this way the record can be found when necessary without movement of the access heads. Although this allows fast retrieval of records, it can lead to very low packing density of data because there may be many additions in one area and few in others. To allow for many additions to every cylinder, when only one cylinder has a large number of additions, is wasteful of space. This is discussed in more detail below. The second commonly used technique is to provide an independent or global overflow area which is used to store records added to any part of the file. This is a very efficient way of handling additions, because all the available space can be used before there is any need to provide extra overflow space. However, it means that references to added records will require movement of the access heads, which wastes a great deal of time. As one overflow technique saves time but wastes space, while the other saves space but is slow, many users choose a compromise. A reasonably-sized embedded overflow area is provided on each cylinder, while a small independent overflow area is used to store additions that overflow from their home cylinder. Variations in numbers of additions from one cylinder to another are to be expected. This method ensures that the file designer is not forced to provide very large embedded overflow areas on every cylinder, when only a few cylinders require them. The distribution of additions to a file guides the designer in allocating overflow areas. Before the appropriate decision can be made, the pattern of additions to the file has to be determined. Sometimes this can he predicted or measured, but on other occasions there may be no prior information for the designer to work on. A number of typical cases are discussed below. No additions expected This can arise when, for example, a file contains records of policyholders under a policy no longer offered. The number of policyholders cannot grow, and in this case the designer would not allocate any overflow areas. This provides a file that is well packed; however, if conditions change later the file needs to he respecified. Equal numbers of additions to each area This is a very unusual case. The designer must know that additions will be equal. It might arise if one  additional record were added to each group of consecutive records; for example, a group of stores might begin to open on a Saturday, and require an extra record for each store to record transactions. The superficially similar case in which there is an equal probability of additions to any area is covered below. If the designer is satisfied that equal additions to every cylinder are going to occur, then it is possible to provide only embedded overflow areas. This will allow rapid retrieval from the file as no extra head movements will be caused by additions. The designer has to decide on the size of the embedded overflow areas. Very often, if it is known that additions will be made precisely evenly throughout the file, it will also be known when they will be made. An example would be when an extra record is added for each project in a company every day. If this information is not available the designer will have to estimate it. The intention will be to plan how frequently the file will require reorganization to merge additions and remove deleted records. After this has been done several times, the actual frequency of reorganization can be compared with that expected, and the future reorganization schedule will be based on the results. All additions concentrated in a few areas This can occur when, for example, recruitment campaigns for customers have taken place in a limited area, or a competitor has gone out of business. In these cases, if customer numbers are based on areas, additions will be in groups. It is unusual for this to be the normal form of additions. If the designer is faced with it, the requirement for embedded overflow areas will be minimal or nil; the main provision must be a large independent overflow area. As this will lead to slow retrieval of added records, more frequent reorganization will be required than in any other case. If the times at which additions are expected can be predicted, it may be wise to hold additions in an ancillary file until each ‘burst’ of activity is over and then to reorganize the main file to include them. Additions equally probable anywhere This is both the most usual case and the assumption the designer should work on if no information is available. It is not the same as equal numbers of additions to each area, since there will naturally be variations from cylinder to cylinder in the number of additions just because those additions are random. The Poisson distribution used to predict synonym behaviour in direct files is the appropriate mathematical tool to use here (note that if the number of embedded overflow areas is small the binomial distribution should be used instead). Assume that l records are to be added to S embedded overflow areas. Then the probability p(x) that x records will be added to a given embedded overflow area is given by the expression: An overflow area will be able to hold some number of records n. The probability that this area will be able to hold all the records added to it will thus be: To demonstrate what this means in practice, assume that, on average, four records are to be added to each embedded overflow area, and that these overflow areas can hold a maximum of five records. From equation (7. 1), the percentage of embedded overflow areas that will have 0, 1,…n additions is given in Table 7.2. These figures are plotted in Fig. 7.8, where the shaded section shows the percentage of areas from which at least one record will overflow into the independent overflow area. This turns out to be about 21.5 per cent of embedded overflow areas . The percentage of added records that cannot be held in these embedded overflow areas is about 10.26 per cent. This difference is due to the fact that only one-sixth of the records added to the ‘six additions’ figure will overflow, two-sevenths of the ‘seven additions’, three-eighths of the ‘eight additions’, and so on. Table 7.3 shows the percentage of all additions that will be held in independent overflow for various combinations of embedded overflow area size and number of additions. This has similar values to those given in Table 6.4. The reason is that the addition of records to direct access files is mathematically similar to the random addition of records to overflow areas. The derivations given here are due to the author and were published in the first edition, but Larson has also carried out similar work independently. Cases of equal numbers of additions to each area and all additions concentrated in a few areas are depicted schematically in Fig. 7.9. This shows files with a twenty-cylinder prime data area, and a two-cylinder independent overflow area. Each prime data cylinder contains ten tracks. A track can hold up to five records. One track in each cylinder is set aside as an embedded overflow area. The files have each had eighty records added. The assumptions made are: a) equal numbers of additions have been made to every cylinder; b) additions of twenty, twenty-four and thirty-six records have been made to cylinders five, ten and fifteen. c) additions have been made as they occur, in an entirely chance sequence. As this is a small file, it is useful to check how accurately the Poisson distribution approximates to the more strictly accurate binomial distribution. Using equations (6.6)—(6.9), the figures obtained are shown in Table 7.4. The correspondence between the two sets of figures appears to be good. A check on this using the chi-squared significance test (see Moroney or any standard statistical text for further details) shows that there is no significant         difference between the two. This means that any real set of figures obtained by adding records to a file would be expected, due to normal random variations, to show larger discrepancies from the calculated figures. Thus the Poisson distribution can safely be used instead of the binomial for files of this size. These three examples show the wide range of conditions that will have to be handled in providing far additions. Whenever possible, the file designer will have data available on the pattern of additions to a given file. When no data is provided, or if the only information available is an average number of additions, it should be assumed that additions are equally probable anywhere. As experience is gained in using the file, any original assumptions about additions should be checked. Manufacturers' software often provides information about overflow areas that can assist in this; the use of this information is discussed in a later section. 7.5 Addition techniques The way in which additions to an indexed file are made can affect both sequential and direct access to the file. There are two commonly used techniques. In the first the record that is added is inserted into its correct position in the file, and the record at the end of the track to which it was added drops off into overflow. In the second, the added record is placed in overflow,linked from the record before it in sequence, and back to the record following it. Record insertion The principle is as shown in Fig. 7.10. The advantage of this technique is that, in subsequent processing, the whole prime data track can be handled   sequentially by the software, and overflow records are picked up only when the prime track has been processed. The disadvantage is that, on average, half the records on the track need to be shunted up (in this example records 113, 1 14 and 116 have been moved), and the overflow area will also require updating. Both of these functions can be carried out quickly and efficiently in main storage, and it is important to use the manufacturers' software and allocate space to allow this to happen. If half the records on a track have to be moved one at a time, and a device revolution is required for each movement, additions can take a great deal of time. This would be the situation if the programmer had not allocated sufficient working storage to the file. The IBM indexed sequential file management system ISAM works on the insertion principle. The cylinder index, a track index and a data cylinder are shown in Fig. 7.11(a) as they are set up. The file consists of four cylinders, 004) 3, and cylinder 01 is illustrated. Each cylinder index entry gives the address of the cylinder it refers to, and the highest key on the cylinder. In the case shown this is 341. This will remain the highest key on the cylinder . If a record with the key 342 is added, it will be stored on the first track of cylinder 02. The same principle applies to the highest key on any track; as the highest key on track 06 was 298 when the file was created, a record with the key 299 belongs logically to track 07, whether it is stored on that track already or has not yet been added. The form of balanced tree index used in ISAM operates as follows. There are two track index entries for each track. The functions of these entries are given in Fig. 7.12. The normal entry links the highest key at present on the prime data track with the address of the track. It allows a program to check what records are at present physically on that track. The overflow entry links the highest key on the logical track, which comprises both the prime (physical) and overflow parts of it, and the address of the first record in the chain of overflow records for that track. A program can check from this what     records are at present logically on that track. ‘Logical’ here means those records that are processed as if they were on the track. The effect of additions no processing times is discussed under the sections on sequential and direct access to indirect sequential files (see pp. 251 and 261). The way in which additions occur, and the changes to index and link entries, are shown in Fig. 7.11. The field shown as COCR in the track index stands for cylinder overflow control record . This is used to store information about the address of the last overflow record on the cylinder, the number of bytes of overflow space still remaining and additional data required if the file contains variable-length records. When records are added to a file organized in this way, there is an advantage to be gained by planning the additions procedure. Additions should be sorted into descending order. As the last record added is the first in the overflow chain, it is helpful if this physical order is also the logical order of the record keys. Coyle has pointed out that significant savings can be made in ISAM file timings by using this technique. Record linking This method operates as shown in Fig. 7.13. The advantage of the method is that records on the prime data track do not have to be moved; a link field has to be inserted in record 111, however. The disadvantage for sequential   processing is that there will be several rotations during the processing of a track with overflow. for direct processing the track index does not make it clear which records are in overflow and which in the prime data area; this prevents the first overflow record being retrieved as quickly as is achieved in the two-entry index system — at least while it is the only overflow record. However, the index itself takes up less space. IBM s control sequential file organization, used with the 1400 series computers, added link fields to the records shown above as 111 and 112. This was the organization that preceded the indexed sequential file management system. The smaller machines in ICL's 2900 series provide an eleven-bit link field that points back to the home bucket if the record is stored in overflow. This field is present in all records, whether they are in overflow or in a home bucket. However, it is only used if the record is in overflow. Otherwise all the bits are set to zero. If a record is stored in overflow, a tag is placed in the home bucket, pointing to the overflow storage position. This is made up of a twenty-four-bit field containing the overflow address plus control information, followed by the record key, which can be up to sixty-four characters in length. The details are shown in fig. 7.14. It is usually somewhat easier to insert link fields to handle overflow — particularly when they are already available in the records — than to move up all the records on a track to accommodate a record in its correct sequence. However, the extra speed of processing will repay the time taken to move these records if the file is frequently processed sequentially. If the file is mainly processed directly, the link method may be more efficient. In most cases, however, the user will have no choice in the matter. It is usually a case of accepting the method used by the manufacturer whose software is being employed. Addition techniques compared in practice Montgomery and Hubbard have compared the performance after additions of IBM's ISAM and ICL's 1900 series indexed sequential software, the files being held on a 2314 and its ICL equivalent, an EDS 30. They looked at: 1. random retrieval; 2. random insertion; 3. sequential processing; for buckets holding two, six and fourteen records. Random processing Random retrieval gave very variable results for ICL files. Buckets containing two and six 500-character records required retrieval times of 60 — 70 ms per record, while for fourteen-record buckets this increased to 120 — 140 ms. IBM files, on the other hand, yielded retrieval times of 75 — 95 ms and the effect of bucket capacity was small. The fraction of the file in overflow did not markedly affect performance until it reached 30 per cent of the total file; the only exception was the ICL fourteen-record bucket file, which began to perform worse as soon as additions were made. Random insertions were found to be variable in their effect on timing. IBM files performed better the larger the bucket capacity, while ICL files performed better the smaller the bucket capacity; very roughly, the six-record buckets were equivalent, while IBM two-record buckets performed as badly as the ICL fourteen-record buckets. The ICL two-record buckets required about 130 ms per insertion, and the IBM files showed little variation due to the fraction of the file in overflow, but ICL files improved as additions were made, up to 10 per cent, and degraded after this. Sequential processing The sequential retrieval times for both file structures were identical before additions, but IBM files outperformed ICL in every case after additions. This was most marked for large bucket sizes; IBM fourteen-record bucket files gave average retrieval times increased from 40 ms to 55 ms as a result of 40 per cent of the file being stored in overflow. Average retrieval times fur ICL files, however, increased from 40 ms to 150 ms due to the same number of additions. Comment on these comparisons These findings are generally in accord with the considerations on the two types of balanced tree discussed earlier. However, it should be noted that additions to IBM files did not take a great deal longer than to ICL files, while random retrievals from IBM files were not markedly more rapid. The authors point out that record size is an important factor which was not varied in the work quoted, and it would not be safe to draw far-reaching conclusions from a limited investigation of this sort. Further work may clarify the differences between these two methods of handling overflow records over a wider range of conditions. 7.6 Data format Individual records Manufacturers' software usually provides for two formats, as discussed in Chapter 3 (see p. 57). Because it is necessary for indexed sequential software to build indexes, insert records, etc., the keys of records must be available to the software. For this reason the separate count, key and data format is usually required, i.e.  The software that handles index building and additions can operate on the keys separately, while the size of the gap between key and data allows the data record to be transferred into main storage if it turns out to be the required record after examination of the key by the control unit. A SEARCH ON KEY, for example, will compare every record key with the search key value, but will only read in the data record or records that satisfy the search conditions. These are generally: KEY EQUAL KEY HIGH OR EQUAL KEY LOW OR EQUAL In the case of unblocked records, the most likely condition would be KEY EQUAL, as a particular record would be searched for. It is usual for the file to be arranged in ascending key sequence, and for the file creation software to expect input to the file to be physically in this order (on initial creation) or logically in this order (when a file with overflow records is reorganized). In principle, a file could be arranged in descending order, but most manufacturers' software checks that the order is ascending and, if it is not, halts until the input order is corrected. Blocked records Searching for a record in blocked format is complicated by the fact that only one key can be placed in front of the block. This is usually the key of the last record in the block, as is shown in Fig. 7.15. In the example shown in Fig. 7.15(a), record 112 is in the second block. If we were searching for this record, a comparison with the ‘key’ of the first block would be low, and of the second, high. Thus a HIGH OR EQUAL comparison condition will be used to search a blocked file looking for a given record. In this case the whole block will have to be moved into main storage, and the desired record will be retrieved by the use of a de-blocking algorithm. If the ISAM method is in use, the effect of adding a new record to   a block of records is to cause the block to be re-built, incorporating the new record and pushing the last record of the last block on the track off into overflow. If record 113 were an addition to the file in fig. 7.15(a), the new structure would be as in fig. 7.15(b). Record 119 goes into the next block, if that is on this track, or otherwise into overflow. Note that overflow records arise singly, however the prime data area is formatted, and that they are usually stored singly in indexed sequential files (but see discussion of VSAM on p. 266). The process described is that used in IBM systems. ICL does not provide a separate key format in its 2900 series buckets. Instead, home records are located using the bucket index and overflow records via the home bucket and a tag. Variable-length records In many cases variable-length records are not provided for by manufacturers' software. It is possible to pad out all records to the length of the largest and handle them as fixed-length. This wastes space, but the user will not be able to avoid such a shortcoming in manufacturers' software by any other technique. Often the solution is to move to a different operating system . The smaller IBM operating systems do not support variable-length records for indexed sequential files, but the larger ones do. There are obvious additional tasks to be carried out, such as de-blocking, overflow calculations and efficient packing of the file storage areas that make this limitation understandable. Even if an installation finds it convenient to use one of the smaller operating systems for much of its work, it may he possible to switch to an operating system that provides the extra facility to handle variable-length records, just for those files that need it. Overflow records It was mentioned above that overflow records arise singly. In addition, an embedded overflow area will usually contain varying numbers of records from several tracks. This leads to overflow records usually being stored in unblocked format, even if the records in the prime data area are blocked. There is some advantage in treating the whole embedded overflow area as a single large blocked record, and manufacturers' software often does transfer the whole track into main storage when an addition is to be made; this allows for the addition itself, creation of link fields, changes of index, etc. However, handling the whole track as a single block would prevent rapid transfer of individual records from the embedded overflow area during direct access reference, which is the reason this method is often not adopted (but see the section on software packages, p. 264). Key size On a 3330, the space taken up by the track index will be at least 57 per cent of track zero if all but one track of the device is allocated to data storage (the remaining track is assumed to be reserved for overflow records). If keys are greater than 155 bytes in length, the track index will exceed one full track in extent, and maximum length keys of 256 bytes will cause the cylinder index to take up as much as 28 per cent of the second track on the cylinder as well. Equivalent figures for the 3350 are even higher: the minimum track index size for a full cylinder file with no embedded overflow areas is 85 per cent of track zero, while maximum key sizes could expand this to almost one and two-thirds of a track. The influence of key size is shown in Fig. 7.16. 7.7 File packing The prime data area of an indexed sequential file is less densely packed than the data area of a sequential file. There are three reasons for this. They are as follows: 1 The records or blocks of records take up more space, because they are in the CKD format with separate keys. The effect of this depends on record or block size, but can be calculated using the methods given in Chapter 4 on blocking and buffering (see p. 75). (Note that in some cases sequential files also use this format. This point would then not apply.) 2 The track index will take up part or all of the first track on each cylinder. The system-defined parts of this are standard in size, but the record key length depends on the user. A typical value might be eight bytes, leading to an index size of rather more than half a track (the number of entries in the index depends on the number of tracks or buckets, while the size of the track depends on the device). If the user decided on very large keys — and IBM   allows up to 256 bytes, for example— the track index might take up more than a single track. This is one reason to choose a fairly short key for indexed sequential use. A further reason is the size of the higher indexes; they, too, will be very much affected by the key size. 3 If embedded or cylinder overflow areas are provided they will take up one or more tracks of every cylinder. The file designer will try to keep these areas as small as possible to produce a well-packed file. However, the considerations given earlier on overflow area size and the need to allow for a relatively long period between reorganizations will guide the designer to a reasonable compromise. If a great deal of direct on-line storage is available, the balance will be tilted towards a larger provision of overflow space. If direct on-line storage is limited, it may be worth accepting more frequent reorganizations as the price for cutting down overflow space. ICL 2900 series software allows the user to specify the packing of home buckets that is desired when the file is created. This can be used to replace or supplement a cylinder overflow area; it is a form of distributed free space that is more evenly available through the file than a cylinder overflow area. These three points will lead in most cases to something between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the space in the prime data cylinders being used to store records. The best that can be achieved is 95 — 98 per cent packing if keys  are small and no overflow is expected. There are, however, two further file structural areas that may reduce data packing. 4 The cylinder index and any higher-level indexes: it is unlikely that any but the largest files will require more than one cylinder for these indexes, although a complete cylinder has often to be set aside for them, as is required by some manufacturers' software. If this applies, small indexed sequential files bear a heavy burden compared with larger files. The probable penalty in packing density for a large file is of the order of 0.5 to 1 per cent, while for small files it can be very much more — 50 per cent in the most extreme case, when the file takes up only one data cylinder. 5 The independent overflow area uses additional space, although in most cases this will not be excessive as the increase in time caused by continual head movements to the independent overflow area from the prime data area and back will soon show up in run times. The usual loss in packing density is again of the order of 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent, but as with the high-level indexes, there will be a proportionately heavy overhead for small files if the software requires a complete cylinder to be used for independent overflow. Apart from the points discussed above, which are due to the structure of the file, two more considerations will influence the space required by the file. 6 Blocking of records: the demand for records in CKD format is more wasteful the smaller the record size. One way to use direct access storage more efficiently is to block effectively. This will depend on space being available to handle larger blocks in main storage; it was considered in more detail in Chapter 4 (see p. 75). 7 The use of variable-length records is sometimes unavoidable, but always leads to waste. It may appear as padding to a fixed size due to software limitations or it may be wasted space at the end of tracks and overflow areas because the record that should have gone there was too large. To this must be added the extra time and space demanded in main storage for relatively complex blocking — deblocking routines. The designer of an indexed sequential file will try to avoid using variable-length records; when they are necessary the discussion in Chapter 3 (see p. 67) should be helpful. Coyle has shown that it pays to leave some distributed free space within a file. As pointed out above, ICL allows the user to specify the packing density in buckets, but IBM does not. Dummy records can be provided to take the place of this space, by placing them where additions are expected, or in a pre-determined pattern throughout the file. This solution (used by Coyle) led to marked improvement in ISAM file performance. The packing density is not usually critical, but the additional space used does have an effect on file timing, which will be examined later. Indexed sequential files can be processed either sequentially or directly. As handling of the file is very different in these two cases, we shall examine them separately. 7.8 Sequential processing The user may wish to start at the beginning of the file, or at any other point. using IBM terminology, the SETL macro can be employed to indicate a starting point in the file and the ESETL macro to set a finishing point. When the processing program issues a GET macro the routine shown in Fig. 7.17 is initiated. The user is not directly aware of the steps shown but they will result in both ‘housekeeping’ processing time and input-output operations. The   sequence has been simplified for convenience, but it shows the essential stages in sequential retrieval. We shall refer to it in examining the various operations that can be carried out sequentially. Retrieval before additions All records will be in their correct places and the file will be physically as well as logically in sequence. The cylinder index (and any higher indexes) will only be referenced once at the start of the run. Head movement to the first data cylinder will be dependent on the size and position of the file. All further head movements will be from the current cylinder to the next and so will be of minimum duration — 3 to 10 ms for modern disks. For semiconductor ‘disks’ or fixed-head disks all that is involved is electronic switching, which takes negligible time. The length of a sequential retrieval run will be slower than an equivalent run using a sequentially organized file for the following reasons: 1 Reference to the cylinder index and any higher indexes  This is not likely to take longer than 100 ms and average times are much lower, e.g. 30 ms average head movement for the IBM 3330, 25 ms for the 3350 and 16 ms for the 3380, followed by a search of the index. Thus the addition to a given run time will not be significant. 2 Reference to the track index  There will be a rotational delay of half a revolution on average before the required track index entries are found. This will be repeated for every track on the cylinder, so it will cause a sizeable addition to run times. 3 Increased file size  The track index will take up part of the first track of each cylinder. Overflow areas, even if empty, will take additional space. This will mean that the data requires more direct access storage space than a sequential file. Timing will be increased by: a) extra cylinder-to-cylinder head movements; b) an increased number of data tracks, each of which will require index entries and so will add to the time required for rotational delays described in 2 above. As we are examining the case of sequential retrieval before additions, the items given above do not include overflow retrieval. However, there is more housekeeping activity in handling an indexed sequential file than the corresponding sequentially organized file. This will add to CPU usage, and the greater software module size will mean that more space is required in main storage. The two file organizations are fully compared in Chapter 8 (see p. 300). The effect of additions We shall examine random additions to a file; as the principles involved do not change if the additions are grouped or regular in pattern, the methods used can be adapted to suit those cases. Table 7.5 shows the percentage of tracks with 0,1,2,…additional records as a result of additions made randomly to a file. These figures only hold accurately for large files — 100 or more tracks in extent — although they will act as a guide even for very small files. Fig. 7.18 displays the results pictorially. Note that Table 7.5 only applies to the given number of records per track while Fig. 7.18 is more general. The impact of additions depends on the additions technique used. 1 Record insertion This is the standard balanced tree type of index, described on page 223. If a single record has been inserted, the last record logically on the track will now be held in overflow. The average wait before this is located would be half a revolution if the whole overflow track were full. Usually this is not the case so the average wait will be less than half a revolution. For timing purposes it is best to assume a wait of half a revolution, bearing in mind that this is usually an overestimate. The duration of this wait may often lead to the overflow record being processed more rapidly than prime data track records because processing    time will often be low enough to allow this record to be processed as soon as it is located. Records on the prime data track, as has been explained earlier, may each cause a full revolution to be lost if they cannot be processed during the time the inter-record gap is traversed. When there are two or more overflow records on a track, the first overflow record in logical sequence, i.e. the last to go into overflow, will require half a revolution on average to locate it. This is usually an underestimate as the first logical overflow record is always the last from that track physically and tends to be located near the end of the overflow track. Each later overflow record will require nearly a full revolution. Fig. 7. 19 shows the situation on an overflow track. In this case an overflow chain of three records has been established from the prime track. The logical and physical sequence of these records is inverted, and the wait-time spiral (WAIT 1 +WAIT 2+WAIT 3) shows that it will take more than two revolutions of the disk to access the three records. WAIT 1 cannot be overlapped, except with separate functions of this or some other program. WAIT 2 and WAIT 3 will be overlapped with the   processing of records 1 and 2, while the processing time for record 3 has to be added to the minimum delay of the three WAITS. The estimate of three revolutions for three overflow records will thus be fairly accurate in this case. As n overflow records will require (n — 1) full revolutions, to which the seek and processing times for the last record have to be added, this estimate will get more accurate the more records there are in the overflow chain. These timings will hold so long as wait times exceed processing times, which is often true. When this does not hold, additional full revolutions will be added to the total time because the next record to be processed will be missed, and a further revolution or revolutions will be required before it is available once more. 2 Record linking This technique is used in the direct-link balanced tree. If the overflow record is held on the same cylinder as the prime data there will be an average wait of half a revolution to refer to the overflow record. If processing time is negligible there will be an additional half a revolution to return to the next prime track record, and the total time to locate and process the overflow record will be precisely one revolution. The longer the overflow record processing time, the more frequently will this not be completed before the next prime-track record is available. This will mean that an additional revolution is lost, so the total time incurred per overflow record will exceed one revolution on average. The range of processing times that will allow processing to be completed in a single revolution is shown in Fig. 7.20. Note that, as the time available to process the prime record increases, that available to process the overflow record decreases proportionally. If the minimum figure — a loss of one revolution per overflow record — is assumed as an average, it will certainly not be an overestimate. For long processing times this will be too low a figure, but it will then be part of run times markedly higher as a result of overall long processing times and it is probable that overflow records will not cause much extra delay. 3 Comparison of the two techniques Experimental and simulation work carried out by Montgomery and his co-workers has shown that the sequential retrieval time for records increases as more of the file is held in overflow. This is less marked for smaller numbers of records per block and some trials have shown an improvement for blocks of only two records. McDonnell and Montgomery found that higher overflow percentages than 10–25 per cent led to increased retrieval times for all block sizes. Random insertions to balanced tree files that use two index entries per track took rather less time as the overflow percentage in the file built up. This was more marked for larger blocks than smaller ones. In comparison, the time required to make random insertions to direct-linked balanced tree files did not change with overflow percentage. This is to be expected, bearing in mind the way in which insertion is handled. The effect of hit rate One of the great strengths of indexed sequential files is that skip-sequential processing is made easy. When the hit rate — the percentage of records that has to be processed — is low, records, whole tracks and even cylinders may be skipped without reading them if they are not required. Although a sequential file using a record storage format in which keys are separate from data can also skip records, every key has to be checked so every track has to be traversed, whether any records on it are required or not. An indexed file can allow more marked savings to be made, as only the index entries need to be read, and these show which tracks and cylinders can be skipped. The effect of hit rate depends also on the pattern of hits. Analysis of this is mathematically similar to that of patterns of overflow record occurrences, and the following cases will be considered: 1. random; 2. even; 3. grouped; 4. grouped superposed on random. 1 Random update pattern When hit rates are low, the probability that two adjacent records will both require updating is also low. This implies that there is a good chance the processing of the first record will be complete by the time that the second record is located, so that skip-sequential processing win provide benefits. Whether such benefits are available depends both on average hit rate and on processing time. The results of a series of experiments have shown that the pattern obtained is very similar to those given for sequential disk files in Fig. 5.8(d). Thus the relationship between hit rate and overall run time is roughly equivalent to hit rate, but stepped in characteristic disk fashion. As hit rate reduces, more and more benefit is obtained from skip-sequential processing. This is examined in detail in Chapter 9. pages 300–307. 2 Even update pattern When every second, third,…nth record is updated, conditions are ideal for rapid skip-sequential runs. A constant period is available during seeks to process the records already in main storage, and if every record requires the same processing time this will lead to very predictable run timings. These will increase stepwise in that, up to some limiting time, processing will be entirely overlapped with seeking. Beyond this threshold processing time there will be a loss of one revolution for every one, two,…b records, depending on the number of 1 — O buffers,b , that is in use. A precisely even update pattern is not usual, so the designer is unlikely to be able to rely on such an occurrence in deciding on file timings. However, in the few cases where it does occur, this type of update pattern makes timing calculations relatively easy. 3 Grouped updates This pattern occurs frequently due to factors such as the way in which meter readings for, say, electricity supply are made from house to house, i.e. not at random, or the effects of localized advertising campaigns on a larger file in which many unaffected records are stored. The effect of grouped updates is to cause parts of the file to require few, if any, updates so records are being skipped, and other areas in which all — or most — records are updated, and thus there will be lost revolutions because  processing times exceed inter-record gap times. If skip-sequential processing is correctly used, whole areas of the file can be skipped, producing an improvement in run time similar to that achieved by sectioning a sequential file on magnetic tape (see Chapter 5 for details, p. 112). In group update areas, if every record in the group has to be processed there will be extra revolutions for every record, every second record,…every bth record, depending on buffering arrangements, where b is the number of buffers as before. For all normal record updating a loss of this magnitude can be expected, but it would not apply if the processing involved is trivial because then the records can be processed at reading — that is, rotation — speeds. In summary, the areas in which there are few updates can be skipped very quickly. Grouped update areas will take an overall time related to individual record processing time, buffer arrangement, update density, i.e. hit rate, and device rotation time. Although this is complex to analyse, the average times are easily checked in any given case. The file designer can measure the results of applying groups of updates to the file and make timing estimates based on the results of these tests. 4 Grouped updates with additional random updates This case also often occurs in practice due to the results of cases such as grouped meter readings from customers who were at home when the meter reader called, combined with customers' own readings carried out because they were out when the meter reader called, and a number of special checks that are carried out at a different time. Timings can be handled by considering the two separate situations and combining their effects. The skip-sequential processing of sparsely updated file areas cannot now be regarded as straightforward. Every cylinder, and quite probably most tracks, will have one or more records that require updating. However, the likelihood is that processing and seeking will be entirely overlapped so this will not hold up the overall run very seriously. In the grouped update areas there will be little or no effect, as the hit rate is already high. Additional transactions from the ‘background’ random distribution will only make it more unlikely that seeking and processing can be overlapped. This will reduce the variability of timings due to chance variations in overlap, and so make it possible to calculate run timings more accurately. The effect of blocking The blocking of records in general has been dealt with in Chapter 4 (see pp. 71 — 98). The main significance of blocking here is that, even if a low percentage of records is hit in a run, blocking them together will increase this figure. Again, the increase is not directly proportional to the blocking factor. The results of any given blocking factor on hit rate can be calculated from Table 4.5 and Fig. 4.6. For example, if a file has an individual record hit rate   of 1 per cent and the hits are randomly distributed, the results of varying the blocking factor are as shown in Table 7.6. The reason for the need to read more records is that as the blocks get larger there is an ever-increasing likelihood of at least one update being required from amongst the records in the block. Concentration of updates in a particular area — case 3 above — reduces the number of blocks that have to be read and in the most extreme case, where all or none of the records in a block require updating, the percentage of records that need to be read would not change due to blocking. At the other extreme, very even updating patterns would mean that most blocks or even every block required to be read and such a pattern would therefore make skip-sequential processing pointless. The main impact of blocking on the speed of skip-sequential processing is usually counter-productive, although it often achieves more in space-saving and rapid data transfer than is lost in increased block activity. Blocking will not usually increase the probability of having to read data from a given track, except insofar as it allows more records to be stored on that track. It will, however, mean that a larger quantity of data has to be transferred into main storage for each update operation, even if only one record in the block is required. Overall, a larger blocking factor will not markedly change the balance of choice between skip-sequential processing of sequentially and indexed sequentially organized files. 7.9 Direct processing The overall set of operations that take place when an indexed sequential file is directly processed is shown in Fig. 7.21. This sequence occurs whenever a reference is made to the file, and it is helpful to examine each stage of the process: Reference to the cylinder and higher-level indexes This will involve a head movement in most cases. If the file is small, the cylinder index may be partly or entirely held in main storage, as explained earlier in this chapter (see p. 228). Otherwise it should be stored on the most rapidly accessible device available. Reference to the track index This will take between three-quarters of a revolution and a full revolution as the start of the index will need to be located before it can be searched. This will take R/2 on average, followed by half the index — which is usually slightly over half a track in extent — before the required entry is located. Reference to the appropriate data track The timing here depends on whether the record in question is stored on a prime or an overflow track. 1 Prime track storage  If the record required is available on the prime data track it should be located, on average, in half a revolution. When the start of the track has to be detected, this will be modified; the track index start will have been found — taking a time R/2 — and the index entry will have been located, read and processed during a single revolution (in most cases). Thus the overall time to read the track index and locate the data record will be: These calculations will apply to files in which all the data records are held in sequence on the prime data track, as for example in IBM systems. Retrieval of records in files handled using linked overflow will not be so straightforward. Depending on the software and the linkages provided it is probable that overflow records will have to be retrieved and checked as they are encountered. This will add at least one revolution for every overflow record and will mean that the time to locate a data record, after the data track has been located, will be: where there is an average of m overflow records per track. The additional times caused by linkage handling can be avoided if the link held on the prime data track contains the record key, and if the software can detect whether the required record is in overflow quickly enough to avoid missing the start of the next record. 2 Storage on an overflow track  The effects here can be analysed in three stages. They are: a) first overflow records from a track; b) further overflow records from tracks on a cylinder stored in the cylinder overflow area; c) records stored in an independent overflow area on some other cylinder. First overflow records do not add any additional time if the index has two entries per track, and if the index items point to the first record in the overflow chain. The software will recognize the key concerned, and the prime data track will be bypassed. In the linked overflow case, however, each overflow represents a break in the search. Thus the link would be expected to occur on average after R/2, and the overflow record would also take an average of R/2tn locate (or R if the start of the overflow track has to be found before the record search can begin). Depending on the software, further overflow records may take no additional time — if it is not necessary to follow all chains — or the average time per overflow record may be nR/2, where there are n overflow records per track and every overflow chain has to be followed during a record search. Overflow records other than the first will cause a time lapse of at least(n — 1) R (see page 254 for details). Overflow records held on a separate cylinder will require a head movement to the overflow cylinder. An estimate of their number is given in Table 7.3 for the case where additions are random. There will be little difference between embedded (that is, on the cylinder) and independent overflow methods when additions are random, and independent overflow will prove to be very wasteful of time. As explained earlier, it is therefore important to avoid the use of independent overflow areas except as a safety precaution; the one exception to this is when updates are grouped in a few areas. The effect of overflow records on the average seek times for directly processed records has been investigated by Montgomery and Hubbard and the author. This work has shown the gradual deterioration of performance as random additions are made to a file, and the marked acceleration of this process as records are allocated to independent overflow. Factors involved in design 1 Blocking  Unlike its impact on sequential retrieval, the result of blocking on direct retrieval is not marked. The record search process is not usually lengthened at all, so only the increased data transfer time needs to be considered. This is generally of the order of a millisecond or so at most. 2 Batching and sorting input  Sequential processing of an indexed sequential file avoids many access head movements and minimizes those that are unavoidable. As an example, if there are 200 enquiries made to a file and the file is stored on a disk with 200 cylinders, a completely random distribution of these enquiries would lead to: 126 cylinders with one or more active records in them; 74 inactive cylinders. Handling these enquiries directly would involve 200 average head movements, about 200 × 30 ms for a 3330, giving a total of 6 seconds. By comparison, batching and sorting the enquiries would lead to 126 head movements, most of which would be an absolute minimum of 10 ms and none of which would be much longer than 15 ms. In addition, about seventy-four cylinders could be skipped so there would be around 126 × 10 ms required for head movements. This gives a time of about 1.3 seconds for head movements, rather less than a quarter of the earlier figure. The difference grows as numbers increase; with anything over 1000 enquiries all the cylinders would be likely to be referenced, thus giving a time of 20 × 10 ms or 2 seconds for the batched and sorted input, and 2000 × 30 ms or 60 seconds for the unsorted input. These figures do not allow for two important aspects of the situation. The first is that sorting itself takes time. This is relatively short, but there is also an operating time involved, and for safety a one-minute or five-minute overhead has been added to the actual sort times given in Fig. 7.22. These   compare batching and sorting times with direct reference, for a file that takes up the whole of a 2314 disk. The second consideration is that batching implies holding up the first enquiries to be received. For a true enquiry such a delay is probably not possible, but in cases where the input is directly processed for convenience alone it should always be considered. In the many instances where updates arise in a batch' mode, as for example incoming mail, there is seldom any good reason to process directly, as the overall level of service will be improved by batching and sorting. The few quickly-processed updates that are handled first, if direct processing is adopted, are more than counterbalanced by the shorter overall run time and thus better average service performance achieved by batching and sorting. The file designer will find it worthwhile to examine every direct processing application of an indexed sequential file critically. When batches are large, overall throughput will be much improved if any runs can be converted to batched and sorted operations. The break-even points between the two modes of processing can be seen clearly in Fig. 7.22; for numbers of records for which a sequential curve is above each straight line that represents the time required to process a record directly, direct processing is faster. After the curve is below any given line, batches of that size or greater should be processed by batching and sorting when that is possible. 7.10 The impact of software on indexed sequential files Manufacturers' software Generally, manufacturers provide software to format, load, update and reference indexed sequential files. Statistics on the number of embedded overflow areas that are full, how much space remains in the independent overflow area, how many non-first overflow records are being directly referenced, etc., are usually available. These are of considerable assistance to the file designer, and should be examined at the end of each run, at least while operating data for a file is still limited. The options available to the user will also allow definition of blocking factor, overflow technique and size of overflow areas. As all of these may have default options, it is important that the designer should make positive decisions about them and ensure that the file does reflect the design intended for it. Some other helpful features may be available but not made clear. For example, handling of overflow is facilitated in IBM systems if the designer allocates sufficient buffer space (usually this means defining more than two I-O buffers). A number of manufacturers provide a filestore facility that handles the storage of data files in a way that uses backing storage efficiently but does not allow the user any opportunity to optimize file performance. Although ease  of use is important, this approach to file design is not desirable unless the manufacturer's software also optimizes, which is seldom possible. On occasions manufacturers' software is not highly efficient for a given application, and software houses have taken advantage of this to provide alternative packages. The shortcomings focussed on by alternative suppliers a 1 Large user keys increase index size; 2 Records are unblocked in the overflow areas, which wastes space; 3 Separate software modules are required to handle direct and sequential retrieval, using a great deal of space in main storage; 4 Overflow records add markedly to run times; 5 When high hit rate files are processed, many revolutions are lost due to processing not being complete when the next record is located. Some of the software that is available to exploit these conditions is discussed below. Software packages The COMTEN AMIGOS software allows the user to replace two separate IBM modules, one for sequential and the other for direct reference to an indexed sequential file, by a single module that requires less space and performs the same functions; this is particularly helpful if a single run updates sequentially but allows enquiries during the runs. On the other hand, the dual-function module is larger than either of the single-function modules it replaces, so it offers no benefit for single-function runs. The AMIGOS package includes two other functions that improve space utilization and processing speed. As a standard, each track is divided into just THREE data blocks, so arranged that they are read in the order 1,3,2 as shown in Fig. 7.23. This allows a reasonable time for processing, and results in fewer lost revolutions than is normally possible. However, it doubles the minimum run time, and so will not help in some cases. The second change is that records are also blocked in overflow. Although this will mean a slightly increased retrieval time (of the order of 5 — 8 ms depending on the device) it is claimed that the space saving more than offsets this overhead. Universal Software Inc. offer a PSAM package that achieves improvement by splitting additions between blocks in the prime data area — i.e. providing distributed free space — rather than defining separate overflow areas. This provides more rapid access to established files, and less-frequent reorganizations. Freshly reorganized files are identical in performance, whether organized using PSAM or IBM's ISAM. It is also claimed to reduce space usage. Examples like these make it appear that the performance of manufacturers' software can always be bettered. Coyle showed that it was possible to improve the speed of an ISAM file by more than four times by using the    optimization options available in IBM's software. The steps he took are shown in Fig. 7.24. In the case he quotes it was decided not to use alternative software, and other users should ensure that they have already exhausted the possibilities of improving the performance of their present software before they turn to other sources. The manufacturers have incorporated some of the ideas introduced by software houses into their own offerings, and the facilities provided by IBM's VSAM illustrate this process. VSAM is of interest to us, partly because the indexing technique used, which has been described in detail by Wagner, is a modified B-tree. IBM's VSAM (Virtual Sequential Access Method) This file organization technique is a development of ISAM that incorporates many of the concepts used in the software obtainable from independent suppliers. The method is only available for use with virtual storage systems, and offers access to records in three ways. These are: 1 Reference by record key;, 2 Reference by address relative to the start of the file using the relative byte address (RBA for short); 3 Reference by relative record number (fixed-length records only). Of these, 1 (referring to the record by its key) can be compared to ISAM in operation, so the similarities and differences are examined here. A key-sequenced file or data set is created, with its associated indexes, as a cluster . For our purposes the cluster is an indexed file. Data storage is divided into control intervals which are continuous areas of storage of a size that is not necessarily related to the physical make-up of the device on which the data is stored. This is shown in Fig. 7.25. A control interval is the unit of data moved between virtual and backing storage. In a sense it is equivalent to a track in an ISAM file, in that there is one index entry per control interval. A group of control intervals makes up a control area . The whole of a control area is referenced by the entries in a single index record, and in a sense this is equivalent to a cylinder in ISAM terms. The index relates key values to the relative byte address locations of the data record. Indexes are arranged as follows. All the higher indexes are collectively called the index set , and they are divided into index records containing a number of pointers. One of these pointers indicates the next index record at this level, and is used to move sequentially through the file. The other pointers indicate the location of a number of index records at a lower level. The lowest level of index records makes up the sequence set , and in this case the pointers are to control intervals; the total number of control intervals indexed by one index record makes up a control area. The structure of a key-sequenced VSAM file is shown Fig. 7.26. Additions to the file are catered for by the provision of distributed free space . This can be allocated by allowing a number of control intervals to remain entirely empty, by leaving space at the end of every control interval that contains data records, or by a combination of both techniques. As all the space available in a control area is allocated when the file is set up, VSAM provides the equivalent of a cylinder overflow area in ISAM and a proportion of free space in data storage areas, just as was done in ICL 1900 series software. Records added to a file are blocked in the same way as the original data and not unblocked as in ISAM. VSAM does not leave deleted  records in the data area, as does ISAM. Instead, the area occupied by the record or part of a record that has been deleted is added to the distributed free space available. Within the control interval the remaining records are moved towards the start of the control interval, which requires their RBAs to be altered and avoids fragmentation of the free space in the control interval. When records are inserted, the RBAs of any following records will be increased as a result of their movement in the control interval. If there is not sufficient space for the inserted records in the control interval, a control interval split takes place under VSAM control. This uses any free control intervals in the control area rather than the free space in other control intervals containing data. The consequence of this is that the records may not be physically in sequence after a control interval split, although they will be handled in sequence by the indexes. If there is insufficient room in the control area to handle all additions, a control area split takes place under VSAM control. Approximately half the control intervals in the old control area are moved to the new control area, which is made available either as a result of decisions taken when the file was defined or by extending the file as required. The new control area is likely to be physically remote from the original site of the data. Although VSAM will handle it sequentially, the situation is similar to that of providing an independent overflow area in ISAM and should be avoided whenever possible. Splits in control intervals and control areas are shown in fig. 7.27. VSAM provides the possibility of holding alternate indexes , so the user can reference a file using a number of different keys. The index set defined first is known as the prime index, to distinguish it from the alternate indexes. Alternate indexes are updated when records are added or deleted, if UPGRADE is specified in the alternate index definition. Alternate keys can be duplicated, unlike primary keys, so that a department code could be an alternate key and allow searches to be carried out to select personnel from a particular department. Keys in all VSAM indexes are compressed, only the distinguishing parts of the keys being stored, in order to reduce the size of index entries. These facilities make VSAM more similar to database software than most of the file organization techniques that have been examined so far — in fact, many of the database systems available for mini- and micro-computers provide only this multiple index facility. VSAM itself is used to handle the tables in IBM's DB2 relational database software. VSAM can be optimized by careful design, applying the same principles that have been described earlier. The designer should look at the following factors: 1 The relation of data areas and index position to the physical characteristics of the device. The portability of a VSAM file from one device to another, and from operation under one OS/VS system to another, or from DOS/VS to OS/VS is helpful, as it allows for rapid conversion when different    disks are installed. However, for optimum performance the size of control intervals and control areas should be so arranged that a sequence set record will be stored on the same cylinder as the control area it indexes. This means that movement from, say, a 3330 to a 3350 will require the definition of new control area sizes unless the number of control areas on a cylinder is already 2n on the 3330. There will then be 3n control areas per cylinder on the 3350 and no loss of performance will result from the transfer. The way the conversion operates is shown in Figure 7.25. 2 The size and number of the buffers provided by the user for VSAM directly determines the number of higher index records held in virtual storage (as against backing storage). Hence, buffers should be both as large as possible and related in size to index record size. 3 Distribution of free space — the ability to define empty control intervals where they are required — means that careful planning with a knowledge of the likely distribution of additions will reduce the need for control area splits, and possibly of control interval splits. This will improve performance. Further details of VSAM are available in IBM publications. 4 The size of blocks used to hold data. Although the user may imagine that any block size will be acceptable, VSAM only uses blocks of size 512b or 2048b, where b can take any value in the range 1–16; this means that VSAM will round up any intermediate value to the next available block size, so wasting the difference between the two values. Choice of block size is therefore important if wasted space is to be avoided. Conclusion Wright has described both ISAM and VSAM files as applied to bubble memory, taking account of the particular design requirements imposed by bubble memory. He also provides a very detailed description of the medium. Jalics has compared the performance of IBM's ISAM on a PC AT, a 370/158 and a 3081; contrary to expectations, the micro comes very well out of this trial, due to its use of an improved balanced tree index structure. Indexed files are easily created as a result of the provision of software by manufacturers. Improvements are offered by many software houses; the designer will generally find that it pays to explore all possible optimization techniques for the manufacturers' software before examining alternatives. In some cases, however, the design philosophy of another supplier will meet the user's needs more precisely. A full examination of the application will lead to an informed choice, and optimum performance. Revision questions 1 Describe the main areas of an indexed sequential file.

ACA ACA-FSS-003 3.29 "INTERFERENCE WITH GOODS ENGLISH law governing remedies for interference with goods is exceedingly technical, partly because of the long survival and overlap of a number of different heads of liability and partly because the law, though tortious in form, is largely proprietary in function. The Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 has made some simplification by abolishing one head of liability but it is only a piecemeal attempt to deal with certain deficiencies in the common law and is in no way a code governing interference with goods. Accordingly, the law must still be sought mainly in the decisions of the courts and it is impossible to give an intelligible account of the developed law without a brief historical sketch. The most obvious forms of interference, such as removing or damaging the goods, were covered in early law by trespass de bonis asportatis , the forerunner of the modern ‘trespass to goods.’ Trespass was (and still is) essentially a wrong to possession and the defendant need not have asserted any right to deal with the goods or indulged in any ‘appropriation’ of them. Trespass was obviously unsuitable to deal with the case where the owner had voluntarily put his goods into another's possession and the other refused to re-deliver them, but this situation was covered by the remedy of detinue. In neither form of action could the plaintiff be sure of recovering his goods in specie since the judgment in trespass was for damages and in detinue gave the defendant the option of giving up the goods or paying damages but it is unlikely that this was considered a defect and it should be noted that the  remedy of specific restitution of chattels has remained unusual right up to modern times. However, detinue was open to the very serious objection from the plaintiff's point of view that the defendant could insist on the method of trial known as wager of law,i.e . getting compurgators to swear that they believed him to be oathworthy, although they knew nothing of the facts of the case. This was the principal reason for the remarkable development whereby detinue was all but wiped out by the encroachment of trover. Trover began as an action of trespass upon the case in which it was alleged that the defendant had converted the plaintiff's goods to his own use. By the mid-sixteenth century it had emerged as a distinct species of case involving four allegations. It was alleged (a ) that the plaintiff was possessed of the goods;(b ) that he accidentally lost them;(c ) that the defendant found them;(d ) that the defendant converted them to his own use. The losing and finding were soon treated as pure fictions and the defendant was not allowed to deny them. The new remedy rapidly encroached upon the spheres of trespass and replevin so that at one time it looked as if any ‘asportation’ or moving of the property might be regarded not only as a trespass to it but also conversion of it, but this very wide doctrine was restricted to a principle that the dealing with the goods must amount to a denial of the owner's title. Trover became a complete alternative to replevin despite the fact that it could be argued that, the goods being regarded as in the custody of the law, the distraint did not amount to a denial of the owner's title. The difficulty in extending trover to cases covered by detinue was that conversion could only be committed by a positive act — misfeasance as opposed to nonfeasance. Detinue lay where a man was in possession of another's goods and refused to give them up but could it be said that such a mere refusal was a positive act? The line between misfeasance and nonfeasance is apt to be a fine one and the courts after some hesitation took advantage of this and held mere refusal to redeliver to be conversion. Detinue, with its procedural disadvantages, wilted considerably under this treatment though it retained a place in the law because inability to redeliver as a result of loss or destruction of the goods could not amount to a positive denial of title for the purposes of conversion. Nineteenth-century legislation swept away the fictions upon which trover  was based and it became the modern action for conversion, though no change was made in the substance of the law. The abolition of the wager of law in 1833 caused some revival in detinue but in view of the expansion of conversion, detinue only really remained necessary where the defendant was unable to redeliver the goods. The process of simplification has now been carried a stage further by section 2 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 which abolishes detinue and provides that conversion now also covers the only case that was probably formerly the exclusive province of detinue —i. e . inability to redeliver goods as a result of their loss or destruction. It may be questioned whether this change achieves very much of a practical nature since (a ) one still needs to look back at the common law of detinue to determine what constitutes the new form of conversion and (b ) there still survive two torts of interference with property which have a considerable overlap with conversion,i.e . trespass to goods and replevin. TRESPASS TO GOODS Trespass to goods is a wrongful physical interference with them. It may take innumerable forms, such as scratching the panel of a coach, removing a tyre from a car, or the car itself from a garage, or, in the case of animals, beating or killing them. Putting out poison for an animal to take is probably not trespass since the interference is not direct, a requirement of all true forms of trespass. A defendant engaging in such conduct would, of course, be liable if injury to the animals ensued but his liability would be in what was classified before the abolition of the forms of action as case rather than trespass. Despite the fact that trespass is actionable per se , there is some authority to the effect that trespass to goods requires proof of some damage or asportation but the general view of textbook writers is to the contrary  and there must be many instances where, if mere touching of objects like waxworks or exhibits in a gallery or museum be not trespass, their possessor would be without remedy. Where, however, the touching is not intentional the law may well be otherwise. Diplock L.J. has said that actual damage is an essential ingredient in unintentional trespass to the person and if this is so there is no reason for distinguishing the case of trespass to goods. Certainly, the considerations of policy which point to making intentional meddling actionable even without damage have no application to unintended contacts. Assuming that some damage has been caused, is negligence necessary for liability for unintentional trespass to goods? The answer is clearly yes but the traditional view is that once a direct injury has been proved the defendant bears the burden of proving ‘inevitable accident’ as a defence. However, since the decision in Fowler v. Lanning , which held that in an action for unintentional trespass to the person the plaintiff must prove negligence on the part of the defendant the same may be true of cases of trespass to goods, though the matter cannot be regarded as finally settled. A more extreme view, but one not without its attractions, is that in the modern law trespass to goods is confined to intentional interference and that negligent interference is remediable only by the tort of negligence. Trespass, however, obviously remains appropriate where one takes another's goods in the mistaken belief that he is entitled to do so, for the act is intentional towards the goods. In Wilson v. Lombank Ltd . the plaintiff had ‘purchased’ a car from a person who had no title to it and had sent it to a garage for repair. The defendant, believing, wrongly, that the car was his, removed it from the garage. It was held that the defendant was liable in trespass. Possession essential As trespass is an interference with possession, it follows that if the plaintiff were not in possession at the date of the alleged meddling, he cannot sue for trespass. He may be able to sue for conversion, but that is a different matter. ‘The distinction between the actions of trespass and trover is well settled: the former is founded on possession; the latter on property.’ Alleged exceptions It is said that there are exceptions to this rule and that the following persons can sue for trespass although they had not possession —(a ) A trustee against any third person who commits a trespass to trust chattels in the hands of the beneficiary. (b ) An executor or administrator for trespasses committed to goods of the deceased after his death but before probate is granted to the executor or before the administrator takes out letters of administration. (c ) The owner of a franchise (e.g . a right to take wreck or treasure trove) against anyone who seizes the goods before he himself can take them. But it is questionable whether any of these exceptions is genuine. The language used in the authorities relating to the trustee is none too clear, but it indicates that the trustee has possession of chattels in the hands of the beneficiary, and not merely the right to possess them. It does not follow from this that the beneficiary himself cannot sue, for if he holds the chattels he seems to have joint possession with the trustee. Again, the executor and administrator have long been regarded as having the deceased's possession continued in them; when they assume office their title relates back to his death. They have not merely the right to possess: they are in possession. Similarly, in the case of the franchise, possession is deemed to be with the owner of the franchise. In Bailiffs of Dunwich v. Sterry , the plaintiffs had the right to wrecks at Dunwich and the defendant took a cask of whisky from a wreck before the plaintiffs could get it. The defendant was held liable for trespass, for ‘the right to the possession draws after it a constructive possession, which is sufficient to support the action.’ In a simple bailment determinable at will the bailor does not lose possession and may sue any wrongdoer other than his bailee in trespass, though the bailee also probably has sufficient possession to bring trespass. CONVERSION Conversion at common law may be committed in so many different ways  that any comprehensive definition is probably impossible but the connecting thread running through the cases seems to be that the wrong is committed by a dealing with the goods of a person which constitutes an unjustifiable denial of his rights in them or the assertion of rights inconsistent therewith. Thus it may be committed by wrongfully taking possession of goods, by wrongfully disposing of them, by wrongfully destroying them or simply by wrongfully refusing to give them up when demanded, for in all these cases can be traced conduct by the defendant which amounts to a denial of the plaintiff's rights or the assertion of inconsistent rights. But if this element was lacking there was no conversion. Thus if a bailee negligently allows goods in his charge to be destroyed the plaintiff's loss is just the same as if the bailee had wrongfully sold them to a third party but there is no conversion because the negligent (as opposed to deliberate) destruction is not an assertion of any rights in the goods. Such conduct is now conversion by statute but this is merely for the draftsman's terminological convenience and has no effect on the concept of conversion at common law: for this reason, it must be kept separate in our analysis. What constitutes conversion at common law (1) Taking possession Taking possession of another's goods will normally be conversion as well as being trespass, but there will be no conversion where the interference is merely temporary and is unaccompanied by any intention to exercise any rights over the goods. If I snatch your hat from your head with intent to steal it, that is conversion as well as trespass, but if I throw it at another person, that is trespass only, for I am not questioning your title to it. So, too, if you shift my bicycle from a public stand in order to get at your own, and forget to replace mine so that it is stolen by someone, that may be trespass, but it is not conversion. It is not, however, necessary that the defendant should assert rights of ownership over the goods: taking for the purposes of acquiring a lien or of temporary use have been held to be conversion. (a)Mere reception of goods . Where A, without lawful authority, transfers B's goods to C, the mere voluntary reception of them by C is in general conversion, however innocent C may be. This is abundantly supported by decisions with respect to receipt of goods by a buyer and a receipt of a cheque by a banker, and there are judicial dicta that appear to regard the rule as of general application. Some qualifications of it where the defendant acts bona fide are discussed below. A more questionable exception appeared in Spackman v. Foster to the effect that receipt of goods by way of pledge did not amount to conversion even though the same receipt by way of purchase would have. Whether or not this decision was ever good law it was reversed by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. (b)‘Involuntary bailee.’ Involuntary reception of goods is not conversion. Such is the case of an innocent person into whose pocket a thief, in order to escape detection, inserts a purse which he has stolen from a third person. Even where the receiver knows that the thing belongs to someone else, he incurs no liability by having it thrust upon him. It is no new thing for pushing tradesmen occasionally to send unsolicited goods to persons in the hope of making a sale, but this practice developed to the extent that it came to be regarded in some quarters as a serious social problem. By virtue of the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 the recipient of unsolicited goods is entitled in certain circumstances to treat them as unconditional gifts after six months from receipt, or 30 days from notice to the sender, so long as the sender does not in the meantime take possession of them and the recipient does not unreasonably refuse to permit  him to do so. Subject to this, the law relating to an involuntary bailee may be stated as follows — 1. He cannot, without his knowledge or consent, be made a bailee in the strict sense of that term. In Lethbridge v. Phillips , L, a celebrated miniature painter, lent a miniature to B who wished to show it to the defendant. B sent it to the defendant without any previous knowledge or consent on the defendant's part. The miniature was much damaged by being placed near a large stove in the house of the defendant who was nevertheless held not liable to L. 2. Mere negligence on the part of the recipient with respect to the safe custody of the thing will not make him liable. So, in Howard v. Harris , where a playwright sent the manuscript of a play to a theatrical producer who had never asked for it and who lost it, the producer was held not liable. 3. But he must not wilfully damage or destroy the thing. The law has not, however, been fully explored here. It is simple enough with a small and imperishable article like a book or a fountain pen, but what of a parcel of fish or a piano which is delivered at my house in my absence? I can distrain them damage feasant, but what I want to do is to get rid of them and I am certainly not bound to incur the expense of packing and returning them. If the sender is traceable, probably the most sensible thing to do is to notify him that the goods are at his risk and to request him to fetch them; and if (as is likely with perishables) the goods become a nuisance, the recipient would surely be justified in abating the nuisance by destroying them, even without notice to the sender, if the emergency were so pressing as to leave him no time to give it. The position is rather different when the goods came into the defendant's hands by reason of a genuine, voluntary bailment for then the bailee has a statutory power of sale of the goods if the bailor fails to collect them. 4. The involuntary bailee does no wrong if he acts reasonably in trying to return the goods. In Elvin and Powell Ltd . v. Plummer Roddis Ltd ., X, a swindler, directed the plaintiffs to supply the defendants at Brighton with £350 worth of coats. X then forged a telegram to the defendants: ‘Goods dispatched to your branch in error. — Sending van to collect. Elvin and Powell.’ Then a confederate of X called on the defendants, who delivered the coats to him under the impression that he was the plaintiffs' agent. The confederate disappeared. The plaintiffs sued the defendants for (a ) negligence as bailees and (b ) conversion. The jury negatived negligence and found that there was contributory negligence on the plaintiffs' part, and  Hawke J. held that there was no conversion, for the defendants had acted reasonably. Contrast with this case Hiort v. Bott , where A mistakenly sent an invoice for barley to B (who had ordered none), which stated that B had bought the barley of A through G as broker; and A also sent B a delivery order which made the barley deliverable to the order of A or of B. G then told B there had been a mistake and got B to endorse the delivery order to himself. G thereby got hold of the barley, disposed of it and absconded. Here B was held liable to A for conversion. Had he merely handed the delivery order to G for return to A, the decision might have been otherwise, but by endorsing it to G he had gone far beyond what was necessary to secure the return of it to A. (2) Abusing possession Abuse of possession which the defendant already has may take many forms, such as sale accompanied by delivery of the plaintiff's goods or their documents of title to another, pawning them, or otherwise disposing of them. Even the use of a borrowed car for the transporting of uncustomed watches is a conversion of the car, for such conduct if discovered leads to the forfeiture of the car under the Customs and Excise Act 1952 and its consequent loss to the owner. In less extreme cases of unauthorised use by a bailee the question whether his act amounts to conversion probably depends upon the degree of departure from the terms of the bailment. However, at common law an omission on the part of the defendant (e.g . negligently allowing the goods to be stolen) would not make him liable for conversion though if he were a bailee of the goods he might be liable in detinue in such circumstances. Since this type of detinue is now by statute assimilated to conversion there may now be liability in conversion. A mere bargain and sale or other attempted disposition of goods by a person without a transfer of possession,i. e . delivery, on the other hand, is not a conversion; the act is void and does not change the property or the possession. But in those cases where a person in possession of goods to  which he has no title may confer a good title on someone else by selling, pledging, or otherwise disposing of the goods, then, since the true owner is deprived of his title to the goods, such a disposition constitutes conversion whether or not the goods are actually delivered. The destruction of goods amounts to conversion and so does the alteration of their nature. If I make an omelette of your eggs or a statue out of your block of marble, that is conversion. The question to whom the omelette and the statue belong is another matter, and Salmond pointed out that the attempts of the older lawyers to transplant the Roman law of specificatio, confusio and the like to our system are of small practical use at the present day. The better method of solving the question is to split it into, ‘Who owns the newly created thing?’ and ‘Who is entitled to possession of it?’ The probable answer to the first inquiry is that ownership of material is unchanged by alteration of it; to the second, that the court will use its discretion in making an order for specific restitution and will award the thing to him whose interest is the more substantial, on condition that he pays the value of the other's interest. But if the thing is perishable, recovery of the value of the goods converted is the only remedy possible. Where the property of A is mixed with that of B which is of substantially the same nature and quality and they cannot practicably be separated (grain in a bin, oil in a tank) the mixture is owned in common in proportion to the quantity contributed by each and the law is the same whether the mixing is wrongful or by consent. Demand and refusal . Proof of a demand by the plaintiff for the return of the goods met by a refusal of the defendant is one of the common ways of producing evidence of conversion for it tends to show that the defendant's detention of them is wrongful. The refusal must, however, be unconditional or, if it is conditional, the condition must be an unreasonable one. It is certainly not unreasonable to refuse to give up a bank note which you pick up in the street to the first stranger who alleges it to be his, if you tell him that you must make further inquiries or that he must produce evidence which will authenticate his claim. Whether the length of time spent in making these  inquiries and the mode in which they are made are reasonable or not may be nice questions. Where, however, there is no question of pursuing enquiries to see whether delivery to the claimant is proper, the defendant cannot justify a refusal because compliance with the demand may have unpleasant consequences for him. In Howard E. Perry & Co. Ltd. v. B.R.B. it was held that the defendants' refusal to allow the plaintiffs to enter their premises to collect goods which belonged to them could not be justified by their fear of intensified industrial action. (3) Residual forms of conversion Though most cases of conversion at common law fall within the categories of taking or abusing possession, such acts on the part of the defendant are not a necessary element in liability provided he has dealt with the goods in a way inconsistent with the plaintiff's rights, such as signing a delivery order for goods which are delivered under that order. It has even been held that refusing to hand over the registration book of the plaintiff's car amounts to conversion of the car since the absence of the book makes it difficult to deal with the car. However, dicta in Oakley v. Lyster went further and suggested that a bare denial of the plaintiff's title unaccompanied by any possession of or dealing with the goods constituted conversion. The actual decision did not support such a wide doctrine, which was laid to rest by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. Where the defendant is in possession of the plaintiff's goods there is no doubt that an unjustified refusal to return them generally constitutes conversion but it has been held that where the plaintiff has possession there is no conversion if the defendant simply refuses to allow the plaintiff to remove them. In England v. Cowley M. owed money to both the plaintiff and the defendant, her landlord. The plaintiff held a bill of sale over M's furniture and put a man into M's house to take charge of it. When the plaintiff then attempted to remove the furniture the defendant forbade him to do so and stationed a policeman at the gate to make sure he did not. The defendant was held not liable for conversion. Bramwell B. said: ‘In order to maintain trover, a plaintiff who is left in possession of the  goods must prove that his dominion over his property has been interfered with, not in some particular way, but altogether; that he has been entirely deprived of the use of it. It is not enough that a man should say that something shall not be done by the plaintiff; he must say that nothing shall.’ Conversion under the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 Apart from one or two minor matters this Act did not interfere with the concept of conversion at common law. However, the Act abolished detinue, which was wrongful retention of a chattel. In most cases of detinue there would be a concurrent liability in conversion based upon a demand and refusal to return but as we have seen conversion required a positive act and had never lain where the defendant once had the plaintiff's goods but was unable to return them because they had been lost or negligently destroyed. Accordingly, to deal with this situation, the Act provides that an ‘action lies in conversion for loss or destruction of goods which a bailee has allowed to happen in breach of his duty to his bailor (that is to say it lies in a case which is not otherwise conversion, but would have been detinue before detinue was abolished).’ Conversion and co-owners As between co-owners there is unity of possession, each is entitled to possession and use of the chattel, and the mere enjoyment in one way or another by one co-owner cannot amount to conversion against the other. The assertion of exclusive rights will, however, be actionable in tort. By section 10 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 co-ownership is no defence to an action in conversion where one, without the authority of the other — ‘(a) destroys the goods, or disposes of the goods in a way giving a good title to the entire property in the goods or otherwise does anything equivalent to the destruction of the other's interest in the goods, or (b ) purports to dispose of the goods in a way which would give a good title to the entire property in the goods if he was acting with the authority of all co-owners of the goods.’ Paragraph (a ) is by way of restatement of the common law; paragraph (b ) extends it so as to make the disposition conversion even if it does not confer a good title on the disponee. Title of plaintiff What kind of right to the goods must the plaintiff have in order that interference with it may amount to conversion? The answer is that he can maintain the action if at the time of the defendant's act he had (a ) ownership and possession of the goods,or (b ) possession of them;or (c ) an immediate right to possess them, but without either ownership or actual possession. This seems to be the law, but it can be elicited only from a great confusion of terminology in the reports. Thus it is said in several cases that the plaintiff must have ‘a right of property in the thing and a right of possession’ and that unless both these rights concur the action will not lie. If ‘right of property’ means ‘ownership,’this might lead one to infer that no one can sue for conversion except an owner in possession at the date of the alleged conversion. But that is not so, for a bailee has only possession and not ownership (which remains in the bailor), and yet the bailee can sue a third party for conversion. And, as we shall see, one who has mere possession at the date of the conversion can generally sue, and so can one who has no more than a right to possess. Examples of right to possess There is no need to enlarge upon (a ) ownership and possession, or (b ) possession, for possession was analysed in Chapter 13. But (c ), the immediate right to possess, must be briefly examined. A reversionary owner out of possession certainly has not got it,e.g . a landlord of premises let together with furniture to a tenant whose term is still unexpired; if the furniture is wrongfully seized by the sheriff, it is the tenant and not the landlord who can sue for conversion. Again, a servant in custody of his master's goods has not possession of them, for it is constructively in the master. But if the master has made him a bailee of them so as to vest him with exclusive possession, then, like any other bailee of this sort, he has it; so, too, if goods are delivered to him to hand to his master, he has possession of them until he has done some act which transfers it to his master,e.g . a shop-assistant has possession of money paid to him by a customer until he puts it in the till. Up to that moment the master has only the right to possess. These examples are tolerably plain, but it must depend to a large extent on the facts of each case whether the law will attribute to a person the immediate right to possess. A bailor has it against a mere bailee at pleasure even if he never himself had actual possession of the goods and only acquired title by virtue of an illegal but completely executed contract of sale. In Manders v. Williams , brewers supplied porter in casks to a publican on condition that he returned the empty casks; held, they could maintain trover against a sheriff who took the casks in execution for the publican's debts, for directly they were emptied the right to immediate possession was in the brewers, the publican becoming a mere bailee at will. So, too, where furniture dealers transferred furniture on hire-purchase to X with an express proviso that the hiring was to terminate without any notice if the goods were taken in execution for debt, they could sue the sheriff for conversion when he levied execution on them. The wrongful sale of goods subject to a hire-purchase agreement will constitute a repudiation and hence vest a right to immediate possession in the finance company even though the agreement does not expressly provide for this. In a simple bailment,i.e . one which does not exclude the bailor from possession, an action for conversion against a third person is maintainable by either bailor or bailee; by the bailee because he is in possession, by the bailor because it is said that his title to the goods draws with it the right to  possession, that the bailee is something like his servant and that the possession of the one is equivalent to that of the other. A buyer of goods can sue the seller or a third party for conversion if he has ownership of the goods even though he has not yet got possession of them. but he cannot sue the third party if ownership has passed to such third person by reason of exceptions to the rule nemo dat quod non habet, e.g . by bona fide purchase for value in market overt; the seller, however, is liable for conversion to the original buyer. A person who is entitled to the temporary possession of a chattel and who delivers it back to the owner for a special purpose may, after that purpose is satisfied and during the existence of his temporary right, sue the owner for conversion of it;a fortiori he can sue anyone else. Jus tertii Once a system of law accepts possession as a sufficient foundation for a claim for recovery of personal property it is faced with the question of how far the defendant should be allowed to raise the issue that a third party has a better right to the property than the plaintiff — the jus tertii . There are arguments either way. On the one hand, refusal to admit the jus tertii allows recovery by a plaintiff who may have himself wrongfully dispossessed the true owner and also exposes the wrongdoer to the risk of multiple liability. On the other hand, it may be argued that a person who has dispossessed another should have no right to raise such issues concerning the relationship between the dispossessed and some other party having a claim over the goods, for there is a serious risk of abuse and of the interminable prolongation of actions. The common law compromised. If the plaintiff was in possession at the time of the conversion, the defendant could not set up the jus tertii , unless he was acting under the authority of the true owner. Where, however, the plaintiff was not in possession at the time of the conversion but relied on his right to possession jus tertii could be pleaded by  the defendant. To this rule there was an exception where the defendant was the plaintiff's bailee, for the defendant was regarded as being estopped from denying the plaintiff's title unless evicted by title paramount or defending the action on behalf of the true owner. These rules were fundamentally changed by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. Since then, in an action for ‘Wrongful interference with goods’ the defendant is entitled to show, in accordance with Rules of Court, that a third party has a better right than the plaintiff as respects all or any part of the interest claimed by the plaintiff or in right of which he sues. Rules of Court made under the Act require the plaintiff to give particulars of his title and to identify any other person whom he knows to have a claim on the goods. The defendant may apply for directions as to whether any third person with a competing claim should be joined and if that third person fails to appear on such a successful application the court may deprive him of any right of action against the defendant. The general purpose of these provisions is to allow the court so far as possible to settle competing claims in one set of proceedings. Where all the claimants are before the court under section 8, then the relief granted is to be ‘such as to avoid double liability of the wrongdoer,’ which presumably means that the court is to apportion the damages representing the value of the chattel according to the respective interests of the claimants. The Act is perhaps not so clear where only the claimant with a possessory title is before the court, for example, because the true owner does not appear or cannot be found. A literal interpretation of section 8 might suggest that the ability to plead the jus tertii provides the defendant with a defence, but it is submitted that in such a case the provisions of section 7 preserve the common law rule that a claimant relying on a possessory interest may recover the full value of  the thing converted. In such a situation the true owner may have been divested of his claim against the wrongdoer under section 8(2) (d) but if not, he might still be entitled to sue by virtue of his title. Two provisions of the Act are aimed at this problem. By section 7(3), ‘on satisfaction, in whole or in part, of any claim for an amount exceeding that recoverable if subsection (2) applied [i.e . where both claimants are parties], the claimant is liable to account over to the other person having a right to claim to such extent as will avoid double liability’; and by section 7(4), ‘where, as a result of enforcement of a double liability, any claimant is unjustly enriched to any extent, he shall be liable to reimburse the wrongdoer to that extent.’ Thus if A loses his goods, which are found by B and then converted by C, both B and A might bring successive claims against C. If B accounts to A under section 7(3), A must then reimburse C. If B does not so account, B is liable to reimburse C. A ‘double liability’ would, however, still exist if both A and B were insolvent. It has been suggested above that where the true owner of goods cannot be involved in the proceedings the common law rule that a mere possessory interest entitles the plaintiff to recover the full value of the goods against a wrongdoer still applies. Does this mean that if there is clear evidence that the goods were stolen by P from X (who has since disappeared) P may nevertheless recover from D, who converted them? It seems that the law's answer is that notwithstanding the general rule about the jus tertii P's claim may be barred by public policy if to assist in recovery of the property would offend the court's conscience. However, not every illegal acquisition by P will call this into play. Finding The popular saying that ‘Finding is keeping’ is a dangerous half-truth, which needs a good deal of expansion and qualification to make it square with the law. A finder of a chattel has such a title as will enable him to keep it against everyone, with two exceptions: 1. The rightful owner. Far from getting any title against him, the finder, if he appropriates the chattel, not only commits the tort of conversion, but is also guilty of the crime of theft unless he appropriates the chattel in the belief that the owner cannot be discovered by taking reasonable steps. 2. The occupier of the land on which the chattel is found may in some cases have a title superior to that of the finder. The Court of Appeal in Parker v. British Airways Board took the opportunity to restate the law in a comprehensive manner and bring order to an area in which there were numerous conflicting precedents. The cases in which the occupier of the land has the superior title are — (a) Where the finder is a trespasser on the land. (b) Where the property is attached to the land, as in South Staffordshire Water Co . v. Sharman where gold rings were found in mud being cleared from the plaintiff's land. (c) Where he is the occupier of premises in or on which the chattels (not attached to the premises) are found and, before the finding ‘he has manifested an intention to exercise control over the [premises]and the things which may be upon it or in it’. The burden of proof of this rests upon the occupier, though in some cases the matter speaks for itself: ‘If a bank manager saw fit to show me round a vault containing safe deposits and I found a gold bracelet on the floor, I should have no doubt that the bank had a better title than I, and the reason is the manifest intention to exercise a very high degree of control. At the other extreme is the park to which the public has unrestricted access during daylight hours. During those hours there is no manifest intention to exercise any such control. In between these extremes are the forecourts of petrol filling stations, unfenced front gardens of private houses, the public parts of shops and supermarkets as part of an almost infinite variety of land, premises and circumstances.’ In Parker's case itself the plaintiff found a gold bracelet on the floor of the  executive lounge at Heathrow Airport and was held entitled to it as against the occupiers. The facts that they restricted entry to the lounge to certain classes of passengers and gave their staff instructions as to what to do with lost property were insufficient to manifest the intention to exercise the requisite degree of control. It is, of course, open to the occupier to regulate the right to possession of lost property by contract with the entrant; it remains to be seen whether merely putting up notices at the entrance declaring that lost property is to vest in the occupier will be an effective manifestation of the intent to control required by Parker's case. DEFENCES TO CONVERSION Licence and the exercise of a right of distress are two common defences to an action for conversion but these have already been considered in relation to trespass to land. It remains to examine the following: Mistake The first thing to be said about mistake is that it does not usually provide a defence, for liability in conversion is strict: ‘At common law one's duty to one's neighbour who is the owner…of any goods is to refrain from doing any voluntary act in relation to his goods which is a usurpation of his proprietary or possessory rights in them. Subject to some exceptions…it matters not that the doer of the act of usurpation did not know, and could not by the exercise of any reasonable care have known of his neighbour's interest in the goods. This duty is absolute; he acts at his peril.’ This rule was set solidly into our law by the House of Lords in Hollins v. Fowler . B fraudulently obtained possession of cotton from Fowler. Hollins, a cotton broker who was ignorant of the fraud, bought it from B and resold it to another person, receiving only broker's commission. Hollins was held liable to Fowler for the conversion of the cotton. The justification for such a rule is not at all obvious, particularly when in the typical case the  plaintiff will have handed his goods over to a rogue on some flimsy excuse while the defendant has acquired the goods not only in good faith but from some reputable dealer who has himself been deceived. One solution which has been suggested would be to apportion the loss between plaintiff and defendant in such a case but this has been rejected as impracticable by the Law Reform Committee. An alternative approach would have been to apply the ‘ready-made’ system of apportionment in the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 to liability in conversion. There was some authority for this but the matter is now governed by section 11(1) of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 which firmly states that contributory negligence is no defence in proceedings founded on conversion, or on intentional trespass to goods. There are, however, many exceptions to the rule that innocent mistake is no defence. The first group consists of what is sometimes known as the exceptions to the rule nemo dat quod non habet whereby a bona fide purchaser of goods from A commits no conversion but actually obtains a good title to them even though the goods really belonged to B and B never intended to allow A to sell them. B's remedy is against A alone. In such cases the law has sought to strike a compromise between the competing principles that ownership of property must be protected and that speedy commerce in goods should be facilitated. Details of this very large topic must be sought elsewhere but the principal exceptions are briefly as follows: (1) Sale in market overt. (2) Estoppel by representation or by negligent conduct. (3) Sale under a voidable title. (4) Disposition in the ordinary course of business by a mercantile agent in possession of the goods or documents of title with the owner's consent. (5) Second sale by seller in possession. (6) Sale by buyer in possession. (7) Private purchaser of vehicle subject to a hire-purchase agreement. Another apparent exception to the general rule that ignorance of the plaintiff's rights does not excuse was recognised by the Privy Council in Maynegrain Pty. Ltd . v. Compajina Bank . The defendants were bailees of barley belonging to X which had been pledged to the Y Bank by means of warehouse receipts. Unknown to the defendants Y Bank was acting as agent for Z Bank, the plaintiff. On X's order and with Y's tacit consent the defendants dispatched some of the barley to Kuwait. This was done without Z's authority. Z's action for conversion failed: Y Bank was agent for an undisclosed principal, Z Bank, and the defendants were entitled to act on Y's consent. Though consent is undeniably a defence to an action for conversion, there are difficulties in reconciling this result, sensible as it may seem, with general principles of agency, for since Y's act was unauthorised it could only be effective if done within an ostensible authority — but that doctrine is inapplicable to undisclosed agency. The act of shipping the barley in Maynegrain was assumed to be sufficient to amount to conversion, but the position is different where the defendant innocently interferes with P's goods whether upon his own initiative or upon the instructions of another, when the defendant's act amounts to nothing more than transport or custody of the goods. Blackburn J. in Hollins v. Fowler said that: ‘…one who deals with goods at the request of the person who has the actual custody of them, in the bona fide belief that the custodian is the true owner, should be excused for what he does if the act is of such a nature as would be excused if done by the authority of the person in possession, if he was a finder of the goods or entrusted with their custody…. A warehouseman with whom goods have been deposited is guilty of no conversion by keeping them, or restoring them to the person who deposited them with him, though that person turns out to have had no authority from the true owner.’ Similarly there is no liability if a railway company, acting upon A's directions, carries B's goods, honestly believing that A has B's authority to give such directions or, of course, where a finder removes them to a place of safety. It must be confessed that this test is a rather artificial one. We have first to pretend that, in the event of A wrongfully directing an innocent person X to do something to B's goods, A is in the position of a finder or custodian of the goods; and then we must ask ourselves, ‘Would X's acts have been excused  if these were the facts?’ If aye, then X committed no conversion. But allowing for this criticism, the test seems to be workable. It would protect all those persons in Hollins v. Fowler who merely handled the cotton ministerially, such as a carrier who merely received and delivered the goods in the ordinary way and it would not save the man who had sold the cotton to another. A solicitor of an undischarged bankrupt who receives after-acquired property on behalf of his client and transfers it to another agent, even with knowledge that that agent has been instructed to sell, is not liable for conversion at the suit of the trustee in bankruptcy, for the solicitor's act can be described as ministerial within the test laid down by Blackburn J. Unfortunately, as Blackburn J. himself admitted, it is doubtful how far it goes. Does it protect X if A wrongfully gives him B's wheat to grind into flour and he innocently does so? The learned judge thought not (and indeed a mere finder of lost wheat could not authorise the grinding of it), and yet he felt that it would be hard to hold X liable. No doubt a finder of perishable commodities would be justified in taking any reasonable steps to preserve them pending the ascertainment of their owner;e.g . he would not commit conversion by making jam of strawberries if that were the only mode of preserving them. But cases like these might well be based on the general defence of necessity. Retaking of goods This is a species of self-help. If A's goods are wrongfully in B's possession or control, there is no need for A to go to the expense of litigation to recover them. He can retake them, peaceably if he can, and in any event with no more force than is commensurate with the violence of B's resistance. Indeed, retaking may be his only opportunity of doing himself justice, for delay may mean destruction or conveying away of the goods by B, who may be quite incapable of paying their value. It should be noted that, while maiming or wounding are not justifiable for simple recaption of property, yet they may well become justifiable for another reason — self-defence. This may occur where B, in endeavouring wrongfully to resist A's attempt to recapture the goods, commits an assault upon A and so justifies A in using violence to protect himself. And if B's violence takes the form of assault with a deadly weapon, A may even inflict death if his own life is in peril. But as the test is that A must use no more force than is necessary, and as this necessity varies with the facts of each case, self-help is likely to be just as dangerous a  remedy here as elsewhere. Moreover, there are other qualifications of A's right to retake goods. Qualifications (a) With respect to persons. He can retake the goods not only from B, the original tortfeasor, but even from a third person subject to the apparent exceptions which arise where that third person has acquired a good title even against A. Such exceptions are only apparent because A, having lost his right to the property, has got nothing which he can retake. (b) With respect to place. There is no doubt that the person entitled to goods may enter and take them from the land of the first taker if the taker himself wrongfully put them there. But it is by no means certain what the law is when the goods are on the premises of one who was not responsible for bringing them there and who has committed no tort with respect to them. The only case of any real assistance is Anthony v. Haney , and even there the dicta are obiter and, although of considerable weight, do not probe the question of recaption very deeply. Tindal C.J. in that case gave as examples of permissible retaking by A from the land of an innocent person, C,(a ) where the goods have come there by accident;(b ) where they have been feloniously taken by B and A follows them to C's land;(c ) where C refuses to deliver up the goods or to make any answer to A's demand for them. As to(a ) accident, the Chief Justice's examples were A's fruit falling upon C's land, or A's tree falling upon it by decay or being blown upon it by the wind. By ‘accident’ it seems clear that ‘inevitable accident’was meant. Negligent or intentional placing of goods on the land of another is a tort,e.g . where a cricket ball is hit by any ordinary stroke out of the ground into another person's premises or onto the highway. The occupier of the premises, far from being put under any obligation to allow the owner of the goods to enter and retake them, is entitled to distrain them damage feasant until the owner of the goods pays for such damage as they have done. Where, however, the entry of the goods was inevitable, not only is there no liability for trespass on the part of their owner, but the view that he can  retake them seems to be right, even if there is no direct decision to that effect. It may be hard that the occupier of land should have no right to compensation for harm done by the fall of a large thing, like a tree, on his premises, but his plight is no worse than in any other instance of inevitable accident. As to(b ), the rule that if A's goods are feloniously taken by B, A may follow them onto C's land rests upon a passage in Blackstone which commended itself to two of the judges in Anthony v. Haney . The distinction between felonies and misdemeanours no longer exists but there seems no reason why the rule, if it is a rule at all, should not apply wherever B's taking is criminal. As to(c ), Tindal C.J. thought that where C refused to deliver up the goods or to answer A's demand, ‘a jury might be induced to presume a conversion from such silence, or at any rate the owner might in such case enter and take his property subject to the payment of any damage he might commit.’ The learned Chief Justice had already dealt with inevitable accident, so that he was presumably contemplating a case in which the presence of A's goods on C's land was due, not to that, but to the tort of A or of someone else for whose act A was in some way or other responsible. If so, it is doubtful whether his dictum about A's right to retake the goods is law. Later dicta leave it quite uncertain whether A can do so where C's refusal to deliver up the goods amounts to conversion, and they are decidedly against such a view where C's conduct in obstructing A's entry does not; and this, too, even where the goods come on C's premises without any tort on A's part. Thus in British Economical Lamp Co. Ltd . v. Empire Mile End Ltd ., C let his theatre to B. B did not pay his rent, so C re-entered and thus terminated the lease. B left in the theatre some detachable electric lamps which he had hired from A. A sued C for detinue of the lamps. It was held that the facts did not show any detinue and it was also said that C had done no wrong by not allowing A to enter and remove them. Note that A had certainly committed no tort to C in leaving the lamps there. Thus it is not easy to predict what  the law is either where the occupier of the land commits conversion by his refusal or where he is blameless. It may be argued on the one hand that where the owner of goods was under no tortious liability for their appearance on the occupier's land, he ought to be able to retake them in any event, provided he does no injury to the premises or gives adequate security for making good any unavoidable injury. On the other hand, it may be urged that self-help ought to be strictly limited even against a wrongdoer and forbidden altogether against one who is not a wrongdoer, except that retaking might be permitted in circumstances of inevitable accident or of necessity (e.g . where the goods are perishable or are doing considerable damage to the land and it is impossible to communicate speedily enough with the occupier or his agent). It has been held that the owner of a swarm of bees has no right to follow it onto another man's land, but this is of no general assistance for, once the bees get onto that land they become again ferae naturae and the property of no one. Tindal C.J. did not profess to make an exhaustive list of the cases in which recaption is permissible, but be the extent of this justification of trespass and conversion what it may, one thing is clear. The retaker, before he attempts to retake, must, if required to do so, explain to the occupier of the land or the person in possession of the goods the facts upon which his proposed action is based. A mere allegation that the goods are his, without any attempt to show how they came on the premises, will not do, for ‘to allow such a statement to be a justification for entering the soil of another, would be opening too wide a door to parties to attempt righting themselves without resorting to law, and would necessarily tend to breach of the peace.’ MEASURE OF DAMAGES FOR INTERFERENCE WITH GOODS Defendant not in possession Where the defendant is no longer in possession of the plaintiff's goods because, for example, he has destroyed them or disposed of them, the plaintiff's remedy is judgment for the value of the goods together with any consequential loss which is not too remote. After some initial hesitation it now seems to be generally accepted that the value should be assessed at the  date of the conversion (though it should be noted that in other contexts the courts show some resistance to any universal rule that damages are to be assessed at the date of the wrong). The recovery of consequential loss is illustrated by Bodley v. Reynolds , where a carpenter's tools were converted and he was thereby prevented from working. £10 above the value of the tools was awarded as special damage. Generally, however, loss incurred as a result of the plaintiff's inability to deliver the goods under a lucrative contract of sale is too remote unless the defendant is aware of the contract. There are many cases of conversion of documents which are intrinsically valueless but have a value in that their possession confers rights on the holder. It is clear that the measure of damages for the conversion of a negotiable instrument is prima facie the face value, not the value as paper but it has been held that this principle is inapplicable to non-negotiable documents such as holiday credit stamps. With respect, this approach seems curiously narrow and may be inconsistent with other authorities. Defendant detaining goods The only remedy for conversion at common law was the purely personal one of damages. However, when the defendant was in possession of the goods and refused to deliver them up on demand his act was not only conversion but also detinue and the form of judgment in detinue might include an order for the delivery up of the goods. Detinue has now been abolished but the remedies for conversion where goods are detained by the defendant are now found in section 3 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which is modelled on the common law remedies available for detinue. The relief available is in one of the following forms: (a ) an order for the delivery of the goods, and for payment of any consequential damages, or (b ) an order for delivery of the goods, but giving the defendant the alternative of paying damages by reference to the value of the goods, together in either alternative with payment of any consequential damages, or (c ) damages. Relief under (a ) is at the discretion of the court, but the plaintiff may choose between (b ) and (c ). If the plaintiff chooses (c ), the defendant cannot satisfy the judgment by returning the goods. Improvement of goods The problem of a converter improving goods is illustrated by Munro v. Willmott . The plaintiff was given a temporary licence to leave her car in the defendant's yard. After the car had been there for some years the defendant wished to convert the yard into a garage but was unable to communicate with the plaintiff. Accordingly, he ‘did up’ the car (then worth £20) at a cost of £85 and then sold it for £100. In proceedings for conversion, Lynskey J. felt obliged to assess the value of the car at the date of judgment (£120) but he gave credit for the sum expended by the defendant, leaving £35 as the damages recoverable by the plaintiff. The matter is now governed by section 6 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 which provides that if the improver acted in the mistaken but honest belief that he had a good title, an allowance is to be made for the extent to which the value of the  goods at the time at which it falls to be assessed, is attributable to the improvement. The requirement of good faith would seem to make the law somewhat narrower than it was before. Effect of judgment Where damages for wrongful interference are assessed on the basis that the plaintiff is being compensated for the whole of his interest in the goods (including a case where judgment is subject to a reduction for contributory negligence) payment of the damages or of any settlement in full extinguishes the plaintiff's title to that interest in the goods. Until payment of the damages, however, the plaintiff retains his property in the goods and may exercise all his rights as owner even after judgment has been given in his favour. In Ellis v. John Stenning & Son A sold land to B, reserving to himself the right to cut and sell the uncut timber on the land. He then sold the timber to E. B wrongfully removed some of the timber and E obtained judgment against him for conversion but took no steps to enforce his judgment, because B was insolvent. B sold the timber to S. E then sued S for conversion of the timber. It was held that S was liable because, the judgment against B not having been satisfied, title to the timber remained with E. OTHER CAUSES OF ACTION FOR WRONGFUL INTERFERENCE WITH GOODS Replevin As we have seen, replevin is an ancient cause of action which is theoretically applicable to any trespassory taking of goods but in practice is limited  to taking by wrongful distress. The modern procedure in the action is for the plaintiff to apply to the registrar of the county court, who will see that the goods alleged to have been wrongfully taken are restored to the plaintiff on his giving security to prosecute an action of replevin in the county court or in the High Court. The plaintiff thus recovers his goods without having to await the outcome of the action while the defendant is protected by the security given by the plaintiff. Replevin is therefore now a form of interlocutory relief. Section 4 of the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 adds a new and more important form of interlocutory relief, available in the county court and High Court, whereby goods the subject of present or future proceedings for wrongful interference may be ordered to be delivered up to the claimant, or a person appointed by the court, on such terms and conditions as may be specified. The procedure is particularly apt if there is a risk that the goods may be destroyed or disposed of before trial of the action but it is not confined to such situations. An order was made under it in Howard E. Perry & Co. Ltd . v. British Railways Board even though the goods were in no danger and the defendants recognised the plaintiffs' title: the shortage of stock caused by industrial action was acute and damages would not adequately compensate the plaintiffs for the injury to their business. Distress and related matters Distress is a remedy given by the common law, whereby a party in certain cases is entitled to enforce a right or obtain redress for a wrong in a summary manner, by seizing chattels and retaining them as a pledge until satisfaction is obtained. Illegal, irregular and excessive distress are actionable at the suit of the owner of the chattels but interference by him with a distress may in its turn be actionable as rescous or pound breach."
ACA ACA-FSS-004 4.02 "INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT OR BUSINESS IN this chapter we are concerned with a group of torts the function of which is to protect some of a person's intangible interests — those which may loosely be called his business interests — from unlawful interference. As we have already seen, the law has been less ready to protect these interests from negligently inflicted harm than it has been to protect person and tangible property, but we are now concerned only with liability for intended harm. It is not possible, however, to say simply that whenever one man intentionally causes harm to another that is a tort for, as we have also seen, the mere fact that my motive in performing an otherwise lawful act is to cause damage to another will not of itself make the act tortious. Provided we give a narrow meaning to ‘intention’ the law may well for practical purposes come close to the proposition that it is tortious intentionally to cause damage by any unlawful act, but it has developed by way of distinct, nominate torts and it is necessary to retain that division for the purposes of exposition. Three further prefatory remarks are necessary. First, a great many of the cases in this area of the law are concerned with industrial strife of one kind or another and where this is so the common law has been excluded or modified since 1906 by statutory immunities granted to persons acting in a ‘trade dispute.’ The scope of this immunity has been changed no less than six times in the last 20 years. Since the legislation assumes the existence of the common law background we must first endeavour to ascertain the general principles governing this area of tort and then see shortly how it is affected when there is a trade dispute. Secondly, the torts considered in this chapter may also come into question in cases of alleged unlawful competition between traders, but in practice they are of little significance because of the common law's refusal to adopt any principle of ‘fair competition’ other than the prohibition of obviously unlawful acts like torts and crimes and breaches of contract. Any full study of ‘unfair competition’ would have to take account of the legislation protecting intangible business property like trade marks and patents, and of the  statutory controls over restrictive trading agreements and monopolies, which have little or nothing to do with anything resembling the law of tort. One of the most significant sources of competition law is the EEC Treaty, which may be directly applicable in England and override municipal law. Article 85 prohibits agreements which have the effect of restricting or distorting competition and Article 86 prohibits the ‘abuse of a dominant [market]position.’ It is virtually certain that Article 86 gives rise to a cause of action in English law at the suit of a person damnified by its contravention and it does so on the basis of an action for breach of statutory duty so that the court may award damages. This is a remarkable development and leads to a sharp distinction according to whether the alleged improper trading practice can be shown to be within the purview of the Treaty as affecting ‘trade between member states.’ If it can, the scope of the remedy in damages is immensely wider than under pure municipal law, the modern legislation in which has generally eschewed the private action for damages as a means of enforcement. However, in Bourgoin S.A . v. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food the Court of Appeal, while regarding itself as bound by the view that Article 86 gave rise to a claim for damages, held that another directly applicable provision, Article 30 (dealing with quantitative restrictions on imports) attracted only the remedy of judicial review. Further consideration of these problems belongs to the study of European law and competition. Finally, the common law contained areas of tortious liability for interference with family and service relationships which were based upon the archaic idea that a man had a proprietary interest in the services of his family and his servants. For example, a husband whose wife was incapacitated by the defendant's negligence had his own action against the defendant for the value of the domestic services which she had formerly rendered and for the loss of her ‘consortium’(or society) and a master had a remedy for ‘enticement’ against one who wrongfully persuaded his servant to leave his employment. Some of these causes of action were restricted by judicial  decision and by legislation in 1970. The Administration of Justice Act 1982 swept away the remaining ones without putting anything in their place. The Act does not as a matter of law preclude a court from holding that an action for negligence lies in favour of a person who could formerly have brought an action based on loss of services but in view of the current law on economic loss it seems most unlikely that such a development will occur. INTERFERENCE WITH A SUBSISTING CONTRACT A commits a tort if, without lawful justification, he intentionally interferes with a contract between B and C,(a ) by persuading B to break his contract with C, or (b ) if by some unlawful act he directly or indirectly prevents B from performing his contract. The existence at common law of the tort of enticement of a servant has already been noticed, but though to modern eyes it involved A persuading B to break his contract with C its historical origins lie more in status than in contract. The origin of a different approach lies in the mid-nineteenth century in Lumley v. Gye . The plaintiff's declaration alleged that he was owner of the Queen's Theatre, that he had contracted with Johanna Wagner, a famous operatic singer, to perform exclusively in the theatre for a certain time and that the defendant, owner of a rival theatre, wishing himself to obtain Miss Wagner's services ‘knowing the premises and maliciously intending to injure the plaintiff…enticed and persuaded [her]to  refuse to perform.’ On demurrer it was held by the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench that while the authorities had until then confined liability for enticement to the relation between master and servant (which that between Lumley and Wagner clearly was not) yet the plaintiff's claim succeeded. The majority held that the case could be decided upon the narrow ground that the action for enticement should be extended beyond the strict relation of master and servant to embrace other contracts for personal services, but support was also given in varying degrees to a broader proposition that a plaintiff might sue for the knowing violation of the security of any type of contractual right. In Bowen v. Hall , on rather similar facts, the Court of Appeal accepted the broader proposition and doubted whether Lumley v. Gye could in fact be based upon the narrower ground of enticement. The rule that inducing or procuring another to break his contract could be actionable at the suit of the other contracting party who suffered damage thereby was only accepted in the face of strong dissent, but the good sense of it is clear. Commercial contractual relations had become valuable rights which could be regarded as entitled to at least some of the protection given by the law to property and while it was argued that the plaintiff ought to be satisfied with his action for breach of contract against the party induced, the latter might be incapable of paying all the damages. The tort has been extended a good deal since Lumley v. Gye and in its modern form its requirements may be summarised as follows. For convenience of exposition reference will normally be made to A's having brought about a ‘breach’ of the contract between B and C and in most of the cases this will have occurred but, as we shall see, there may be liability without an actual breach. Variants of the tort (1) Direct persuasion This is the primary form of the tort exemplified by the facts of Lumley v. Gye itself. A distinction may be taken between persuasion and mere advice, and advice in the sense of ‘a mere statement of, or drawing of the  attention of the party addressed to, the state of facts as they were,’ is not actionable. However, it has been said that advice which is intended to have persuasive effect is not distinguishable from inducement and ‘the fact that an inducement to break a contract is couched as an irresistible embargo rather than in terms of seduction does not make it any the less an inducement.’ It is submitted that the issue is really one of intention and causation. If A's words were intended to cause and did cause B to break his contract with C, then they are actionable by C whatever their form. If so, bearing in mind that intention in this context is not the same as motive and that the tort may be committed without any ill will towards the plaintiff, it is likely to be a rare case in which A's words have had a causative effect on B's conduct and yet A escapes liability on the ground that they were only ‘advice.’ Liability under this head may arise from A's entering into a contract with B knowing that the contract is inconsistent with a prior contract of B's with C as in B. M. T. A. v. Salvadori where A bought a car from B knowing that the sale constituted a breach by B of his contract with C that he would not sell the car within a year. Where the prior contract of B and C is specifically enforceable it would create an equitable interest in the subject-matter in favour of C, which C could enforce against A even if A had only constructive notice of C's rights. In many cases this would render consideration of A's tort liability in a case of actual knowledge otiose, but it seems possible to assert such a claim where there is some additional loss. In the case of land, statutory provisions may give priority to a later contract registered as a land charge even if entered into with knowledge of an earlier, unregistered  transaction, but it seems that this affects only proprietary rights and does not bar an action in tort based on interference with the earlier contract. The other forms of the tort require interference by unlawful means. It is sometimes argued that direct persuasion applied by A to B not to perform his contract is itself the procurement of breach by unlawful means, but the argument is circular and it seems better simply to say that in this form of the tort no use of unlawful means is required. (2) Direct intervention This takes the form of direct action by A on the person or property of B whereby B is disabled from performing his contract with C, as where A physically detains B or steals B's specialised tools without which B cannot carry out his obligation. A similar case exists where A interferes with the subject-matter of the contract in a way which if done by B would amount to a breach of the contract. In G.W.K. Ltd . v. Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd . B manufactured cars and contracted with C that all cars exhibited by B should be fitted with tyres of C's manufacture. At an exhibition, A, who also manufactured tyres, secretly removed C's tyres from B's car and substituted his own. A was held liable to B for trespass to his goods and to C for unlawful interference with his contract with B. However, there must be some conduct which is ‘unlawful’ apart from the intent to injure C, so that, for example , refusing, without any breach of contract, to provide B with supplies that he needs to fulfil his contract with C is no more a tort against C than it is against B, even though A's motive is to injure C. (3) Indirect intervention If, instead of persuading B to break his contract or causing him to do so by direct unlawful action against him, A brings about the breach of the contract between B and C by operating through a third party, X, A may still be liable  to C, provided unlawful means are used. A common example of this form of the tort, though now much restricted by the legislation governing trade disputes, has been the situation where X is B's servant, whom A induces to act in breach of his contract of employment so as to prevent B fulfilling his contract. In J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley , C carried on business hiring out barges to B. These were collected from C and returned to B's watermen. The defendants (A) were officials of a union to which all but a very few watermen belonged and wished to bring pressure on C in connection with a grievance at another company controlled by him. Accordingly, A instructed B's watermen (X) not to man, service or tow barges belonging to C, an embargo which soon brought C's business to a standstill as barges which were out on hire were not returned. In proceedings by C against A for an interlocutory injunction the House of Lords held that a prima facie case had been established that A was liable for procuring breaches by B of the hiring contracts, the unlawful means being the inducement of X to ‘black’ the barges. The unlawful means adopted may be considerably more remote than interference in the contractual relationship between B and his servants. In Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton the International Transport Workers' Federation (1. T.F.) wished to bring pressure on C, owners of the Hoegh Apapa then docked in Liverpool under charter to B and sub-charter to N.L. N.L. had a contract with tug owners to take the Hoegh Apapa out, but as a result of a request from A, an official of I.T.F., the tug crews, in breach of their contracts of employment, refused to move her. It was held that C had made out a prima facie case of unlawful interference with its contract with B, notwithstanding that the direct inducement was not, as in Stratford v. Lindley , one step removed from the contract but three steps removed. In principle there was no distinction between indirect interference at the first stage and such interference at a remoter stage, but the more indirect and remote the interference, the more difficult it may be to establish on the facts that A did intend to interfere with the particular contract relied on by the plaintiff and that that interference was a necessary consequence of A's wrongful act. (a) Unlawful means. In D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd. v. Deakin the Court of Appeal was emphatically of the opinion that unless the case was one of direct inducement of B, the tort required the use of some independently unlawful means. The difficulty with this is that it makes the question of A's liability to C turn on what may be a purely technical contravention of the law by A which is of no real concern to C. Further, there are uncertainties in the  meaning of ‘unlawful’ for this purpose. Voices have sometimes been heard to question or deny the validity of this requirement but, while it is probably true to say that this issue has not been central in the cases since Thomson v. Deakin , the necessity for unlawful means has been so consistently repeated in subsequent statements of the law that it is now hopeless to argue the contrary. Nor, despite the arbitrary results capable of being produced by the requirement of illegality, is the law necessarily unwise in displaying this reluctance to extend liability, for if the requirement of illegality were abandoned a much greater burden would have to be placed upon the defence of justification if we were to avoid the intolerable situation that A was liable to C whenever and however he knowingly brought about a breach of a contract between B and C. (b) Inducement by servant. If my servant, acting bona fide within the scope of his authority, procures or causes me to break a contract which I have made with you, you cannot sue the servant for interference with the contract; for he is my alter ego here, and I cannot be sued for inducing myself to break a contract, although I may be liable for breaking the contract. In Said v. Butt the plaintiff wished to get a ticket for X's theatre. He knew that X would not sell him one because they had quarrelled. He therefore persuaded a friend to procure him a ticket without disclosing his identity. When the plaintiff presented himself at the theatre, the defendant, who was X's servant and manager of the theatre, detected the plaintiff and refused to admit him. He sued the defendant for procuring a breach of his contract with X. The action was dismissed because there was no contract, since the identity of the plaintiff was, in the circumstances, material to the formation of the alleged contract; and alternatively, even if there had been a valid contract, the principle stated above would prevent the action from lying. If the servant does not act bona fide, presumably he is liable on the ground that he has ceased to be his employer's alter ego . It is true that even then he might still be acting in the course of his employment, but we must take it that this curious piece of metaphysics exempts the employer from vicarious liability for this particular tort. Intent of the defendant There is no liability under this head for negligently interfering with C's rights under contract. A must have knowledge of the contract between B  and C or act with the intention of bringing about a breach of it. As to knowledge, however, he need not be familiar with all the details of the contract, for otherwise the tort would hardly ever be committed. In Emerald Construction Co. Ltd . v. Lowthian the defendants knew of the existence of the contract between the plaintiffs and their co-contractors but they did not know its precise terms and said that they assumed from their experience in other cases that it could be terminated at short notice. Nevertheless, the evidence showed that the defendants were determined to bring the contractual relationship to an end if they could, regardless of whether it was done in breach or not. The Court of Appeal held that this was sufficient to entitle the plaintiffs to an interlocutory injunction. Where a defendant is familiar with the trade in question he may be taken to have knowledge of the existence of a contract even though he cannot identify the other contracting party and even though he may have no direct information about any particular contract at all. In Merkur Island Shipping Corporation v. Laughton the defendants were in fact given a copy of the charter of the trapped vessel before the application for an injunction, but the House of Lords held that they had the requisite knowledge independently of this. Commenting that no one is likely to be better informed than a seamen's union as to the terms on which vessels sailing under flags of convenience were employed, Lord Diplock adopted the words of the Master of the Rolls in the court below: ‘Whatever the precise degree of knowledge of the defendants at any particular time, faced with a laden ship which, as they well knew, was about to leave port, the defendants must in my judgment be deemed to have known of the almost certain existence of contracts of carriage to which the shipowners were parties. The wholly exceptional case would be that of a ship carrying the owner's own goods. Whether that contract or those contracts consisted of a time charter, a voyage charter or one or more bills of lading contracts or some or all of such contracts would have been immaterial to the defendants. Prima facie their intention was to immobilise the ship and in so doing to interfere with the performance by the owners of their contract or contracts of carriage.’ There is, however, no general duty actively to inquire about contracts between others. If A had an honest doubt whether there was a contract  at all between B and C it has been held that this would provide a good defence but if the doubt is whether A's rights or C's under two inconsistent agreements should prevail and A chooses to adopt a course which on one view of the law will undoubtedly interfere with C's rights, it has been said that he must at least show that he was advised and honestly believed that he was entitled to take that course. The meaning of intention gives rise to difficulty. The problem may be illustrated by the county court case of Falconer v. A. S. L. E. F . The defendants called rail workers out on strike and the plaintiff, an ordinary traveller, incurred hotel expenses when he was unable to travel on the journey for which he had bought a ticket. The ‘target’ of the strike action was undoubtedly the railway undertaking but it was obviously a necessary consequence of the strike's having any effect at all that it should lead to interference in the performance of contracts of carriage. The learned judge held that the defendants ‘intended’ to interfere with the plaintiff's contract for the purposes of this tort. However, in Barretts & Baird (Wholesale) Ltd . v. I. P. C.S . Henry J. held that the intention of strikers was to put pressure on their employers to improve their conditions of service and not to disrupt the plaintiffs' contracts, even though that was an unavoidable by-product of the strike. ‘On the evidence the desire to strike was the cause of the injury to the plaintiffs rather than the desire to injure the plaintiffs being the cause of the strike.’ The first view would probably extend the law further than it has commonly been thought to go and would expose strikers having no immunity under trade union legislation to a very wide-ranging liability; on the other hand it is not quite accurate to describe the plaintiffs in these two cases as merely ‘ricochet’ victims for it may be the effect of pressure on the public and customers which causes the employer to succumb to the strikers' demands. However, even on the view that the plaintiff must be the target, no malice or spite is required: apart from the protection of the trade disputes legislation the tort would be committed by a trade union officer calling his members out on strike and he cannot defend himself by arguing that his purpose was the increase of his members' wages: unlike the tort of conspiracy, no predominant purpose to injure the plaintiff is required. There must have been interference with performance of a contract Though the wider wrongs of intimidation and interference with trade by  unlawful means may protect mere expectancies, there is no doubt that for the purposes of the tort we are now considering there must be interference with a subsisting contract between B and C. Hence if the contract allegedly broken proves to be void there is no tort. On the other hand, if the contract is merely unenforceable (e. g. for non-compliance with section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925) then it may well be actionable to procure its breach. The action would not be an indirect method of enforcing the contract against the other contracting party because it lies against a third party and in tort. There need not in all cases be an actual breach of the contract. In Torquay Hotel Co. Ltd . v. Cousins an interlocutory injunction was issued to restrain the defendants from preventing oil companies from carrying out their contracts to deliver oil to the plaintiff's hotel notwithstanding that the contract with the principal supplier of oil contained a clause absolving it from liability if delivery was prevented by circumstances outside its control. Lord Denning M.R. said that liability extends to a case where a ‘third person prevents or hinders one party from performing his contract, even though it be not a breach.’ Whatever the nature of the defendant's conduct this should be so where there is ‘no breach’ only in the sense that an exemption clause in the contract allows a contracting party to escape liability in damages for non-performance of his obligation. Again, where the defendant uses unlawful means to interfere with a contractual relationship there would be no point in requiring any sort of breach, because even interference with prospective, non-contractual advantages by such means may be actionable. However, despite an apparent dictum to the contrary, the Torquay Hotel principle does not, it is submitted, extend to imposing liability in a case where A has, without any unlawful act, done no more than persuade B to exercise an  option open to him under his contract with C, for example, to terminate it by proper notice, for so to hold would be to draw an indefensible distinction between existing, but terminable, relationships and those which are merely prospective, and render it necessary to fall back on the defence of justification in order, for example , lawfully to persuade an employee to change his employment for higher pay. Though Lord Denning's formulation was approved in unqualified terms in Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton that was a clear case of unlawful means and the approval should be read with that in mind. While there may be wrongful interference with contract short of actual breach, there must be interference with performance of the contract. Accordingly, makers and dealers in ‘bootleg’ recordings did not commit this tort even though their activities very seriously affected the value of a contract giving a recording company the exclusive right to exploit live performances. If it is a tort wrongfully to procure a breach of contract is it also a tort to procure the commission of other legal wrongs? There is no need to call up the tort where the legal wrong procured is itself a tort against the plaintiff, for the procurer is then himself liable as a joint tortfeasor; nor, it seems, is there a tort of inducing a breach of trust, because a person who procures such an act becomes himself, by the doctrines of equity, liable as a trustee. Procuring the commission of a criminal offence is not a tort unless the crime also amounts to a tort against the plaintiff, in which case the procurer is a joint tortfeasor. Plaintiff must prove that he has suffered damage as a result of the interference Damage is the gist of the action and without it the plaintiff must fail. Where it is clear that the contract-breaker would have taken the same steps anyway the inducement is not an effective cause of the loss. Where, as will normally be the case, the breach is such as must in the ordinary course of business inflict damage on the plaintiff, he may succeed without proof of any particular damage. Where loss of a pecuniary nature is inferred or proved, the plaintiff may also recover damages for non-pecuniary losses such as injured feelings. Defence of justification It is certain that justification is capable of being a defence to this tort, but what constitutes justification is incapable of exact definition. It has been said that regard must be had to the nature of the contract broken, the position of the parties to the contract, the grounds for the breach, the means employed to procure it, the relation of the person procuring it to the person who breaks the contract, and the object of the person procuring the breach. The advancement of one's own interests will not suffice, nor will that of the interests of one's own group and the defendant cannot escape by showing that his motives are impersonal, disinterested and altruistic. However, in Brimelow v. Casson , persuasion of theatre proprietors by a theatrical performers' protection society to break their contracts with a theatrical manager was justified on the grounds that the wage paid by the manager to chorus girls was so low that they were obliged to supplement it by resort to prostitution. It has been suggested that pressure of a moral obligation as justification is the basis of Brimelow v. Casson , though the case has been said to stand alone and there are conflicting dicta on moral obligation. Presumably there is justification when a doctor urges his  patient to give up a fixed term employment because it is a danger to his health, but what of the tutor who insists that his student give up a vacation job because it will interfere with his studies? The question of justification may also arise where A seeks to assert rights under a contract with B which is inconsistent with another contract between B and C. The question here is whether A has a right equal or superior to that of C and if he has he is justified in persuading B to break his contract with C. So if B enters into a contract on Monday to sell to A for £10,000 and then next day to sell the same property to C for £15,000 A, by persuading B to perform the first contract commits no wrong against C. A will also be justified in reaching an accommodation with B rather than exercising his strict legal rights under the contract. In Edwin Hill & Partners v. First National Finance Corporation a finance company which had a legal charge over B's property to secure a loan came to an arrangement with B whereby they would develop the property themselves rather than exercise their power of sale under the charge. A condition in this arrangement whereby the plaintiff was to be replaced as architect for the scheme did not constitute inducing breach of contract. It has been suggested that the defence of justification can never succeed if unlawful means are used, but this is not certain. INTIMIDATION The word ‘intimidation’ when used in the present context signifies a threat delivered by A to B whereby A intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) either to his own detriment or to the detriment of C. There are thus two forms of the tort, which will be considered separately, but first two general points must be mentioned. (a) ‘Threat’ when used in this connection means ‘an intimation by one to another that unless the latter does or does not do something the former will do something which the latter will not like.’ It is coercive and not mere idle abuse and demands either action or abstention from action on the part of the recipient, so a mere announcement by A that he proposes to strike B is not, for the purposes of the law, a ‘threat’ and cannot of itself give rise to a claim  for damages. On the other hand, the fact that a threat is couched in polite and regretful language does not make it any less a threat, and there is little value in the distinction which has been suggested between a warning and a threat. (b) For a threat as thus defined to be capable of giving rise to an action for damages on the part of anyone it must be a threat of an unlawful act. Anything that I may lawfully do I may also lawfully threaten to do, whatever the motive or purpose of my threat. This is an inescapable result of Allen v. Flood , however unfortunate some of its consequences may be. Accordingly in Hardie and Lane Ltd . v. Chilton , the Court of Appeal held that a threat by A, a trading association, to put B, one of its members, on a ‘stop list’(which would prevent B from getting goods from the members of the association) unless B paid a sum of money for having broken a rule of the association was not a tort. Third-party intimidation Despite some earlier hesitations, it is now certain that A commits the tort of intimidation against C if he threatens B with conduct which is unlawful in relation to B and thereby intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) in a way which causes damage to C. It is not a requirement of this tort that B's conduct be in any way unlawful in relation to C. An old illustration is Garret v. Taylor , where the plaintiff was the lessee of a quarry and alleged that the defendant had ‘disturbed’ his customers and his workmen by ‘threatening to mayhem and vex them with suits if they had brought any stones.’ It was held that on these facts the plaintiff had a good cause of action. In Rookes v. Barnard , decided by the House of Lords in 1964 and the leading authority on this tort, the plaintiff (C) was employed by B.0.A.C. (B) in their design office and the three defendants (A) were officials of the A.E.S.D. Union, two of them also being employees of B.O.A.C. C had been but was no longer a member of the Union. In order to preserve 100 per cent. union membership in the design office and notwithstanding the fact  that a strike would have involved the men in breaches of their contracts of employment, A notified B of the resolution passed by members of the union that if C was not dismissed, ‘a withdrawal of labour of all A.E.S.D. Membership will take place.’ B yielded to this threat and lawfully terminated C's contract of employment. Owing to the provisions of the Trade Disputes Act 1906 C could not rely upon a simple conspiracy to injure but in the House of Lords it was held that he was entitled to succeed on the ground of intimidation. The House held, agreeing with the Court of Appeal, that there is a tort of intimidation, but they also held, reversing the Court of Appeal, that the tort extends to threats by A to break his contract with B and is not confined to threats of criminal or tortious conduct. The essence of the tort lies in the coercion of B, through whom A intentionally inflicts damage upon C, but obviously the law cannot hold every form of coercion to be wrongful. If A tells his grown-up son, B, that he will stop B's allowance if B marries C, A may succeed, as is no doubt his intention, in depriving C of a profitable marriage, but he commits no tort against her, for he is perfectly entitled to stop B's allowance for any reason. The law has therefore adopted the natural dividing line between what is lawful and what is unlawful as against B, the person threatened. The significance of Rookes v. Barnard was that it made it clear that a threat of a breach of contract was unlawful for this purpose but the criticism has been made (and this indeed was the opinion of the Court of Appeal) that if intimidation is extended to threats to break contracts ‘it would overturn or outflank some elementary principles of contract law,’ notably the doctrine of privity of contract, which holds that one who is not a party to a contract cannot found a claim upon it or sue for breach of it. Two answers have been made to the privity of contract objection. First, it can be said not merely that C does not sue for breach of contract between A and B, but that his cause of action actually depends upon the contract not having been broken. It is only because B yields to A's threat that it might be broken that C suffers damage at all. If B does not yield and the contract is broken, then A's threat has not caused C to suffer loss. And if it be objected that A may act first (against B) and explain why afterwards, whereupon B acts to C's detriment, the answer is that it is not A's act which has caused C's loss but the implied threat that it will be repeated. Alternatively it may be said bluntly that in all cases of intimidation, whatever the nature of the threatened act, C's cause of action is wholly independent of B's. C founds not upon the wrong, if any, done to B but on the fact that A has set out to injure him by the use of an unlawful weapon: ‘I can see no difference in principle between a threat to break a contract and a threat to commit a tort. If a third party could not sue for damage caused to him by the former I can see no reason why he should be entitled to sue for damage caused to him by the latter. A person is no more entitled to sue in respect of loss which he suffers by reason of a tort committed against someone else than he is entitled to sue in respect of loss which he suffers by reason of breach of a contract to which he is not a party. What he sues for in each case is loss caused to him by the use of an unlawful weapon against him — intimidation of another person by unlawful means.’ The second approach does more than answer the privity of contract objection: it refutes its basic premise. The point is ‘that the ‘weapon,’i.e . the means, which the defendant uses to inflict loss on the plaintiff, may be unlawful because it involves conduct wrongful towards a third party. There is no reason in principle why such wrongful conduct should include torts and not breaches of contract. One might argue about whether it is expedient for the law to forbid the use of such acts as a means of causing loss, but the privity doctrine is a red herring.’ If one asks why the law should draw the line at threats of breach of contract and not include within the tort of intimidation some threats against B even though the acts threatened are not strictly unlawful, the answer can lie only in the structure of the law. There is a legal ‘chasm’ between, for example, not entering into a contract and breach of an existing contract, which will not easily be bridged. It must, however, be admitted that the above argument, to some extent, depends upon a ‘general’ or even expansive approach to unlawful means in intimidation and in the economic torts as a whole. As a result of the decision of the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ) it is possible (though by no means certain) that threat of a breach of a penal statute does not amount to unlawful means for the purposes of intimidation unless the statute itself gives rise to a civil remedy. If so, it is perhaps  surprising that a threat of a mere breach of contract should give rise to liability. Two-party intimidation There is little direct authority on the position where A threatens B with an unlawful act and thereby intentionally causes B to act (or refrain from acting) in a way which causes loss to B himself. Nevertheless the general opinion seems to be that A commits a tort, certainly where his threat is of violence, and also, since Rookes v. Barnard , where the threat is of any unlawful act within the meaning of that case. On the other hand, in J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley Lord Reid said, ‘A case where a defendant presents to the plaintiff the alternative of doing what the defendant wants him to do or suffering loss which the defendant can cause him to incur is not necessarily in pari casu and may involve questions which cannot arise where there is intimidation of a third person.’ The problems centre round the effect in the two-party situation of a threat of a breach of contract. First, in the two-party situation there is normally a remedy already available to B, while in the three-party situation, if C cannot sue for intimidation, he cannot sue at all. If B is threatened with a breach of contract he may be able to treat the contract as repudiated and sue for anticipatory breach or, of course, he may await the breach and then sue for damages. In fact, the balance of advantage would seem to lie in holding that where A threatens B with a breach of his contract with B, B should be restricted to his contractual remedies. The law should not encourage B to yield to the threat but should seek to persuade him to resist it. In some cases he may be able to obtain an injunction to restrain the breach and in any case he will be adequately compensated by his remedy in damages for breach of contract as his damage can scarcely be other than financial. If B is threatened with a tort it is, of course, equally true that he may bring an action for damages if the tort is committed or bring an action for a quia timet injunction first, but, especially  where the threat is of violence, it is perhaps less realistic to say that these legal remedies afford him adequate protection against the consequences of resistance. From the point of view of policy, therefore, there is much to be said for the view that no independent tort is committed when all that is threatened, in the two-party situation, is a breach of contract, though there is not very much authority for such a proposition. Secondly, since Rookes v. Barnard there has been considerable development in the contractual context of the doctrine of ‘economic duress,’ and in this context it is clear that although a threat to break a contract is ‘illegitimate’it will not amount to duress unless it goes beyond commercial pressure and amounts to ‘coercion of the will.’ In Pao On v. Lau Yiu A threatened that unless B agreed to vary an existing contract between them by giving A a guarantee against loss, A would not fulfil his side of the agreement. A's action on the guarantee succeeded because, although B had acceded to the demand because of fears of delay in litigation and loss of public confidence, the pressure fell short of coercion. Though intimidation was not discussed in the case it cannot be that B could have avoided the binding nature of the contract by the simple device of counterclaiming for damages for intimidation and it seems therefore that for the purposes of intimidation the plaintiff should be required to show unlawful coercion at least of such a degree as would enable him to avoid a contract. If there are any cases in which the victim of unfair pressure may avoid a contract even though the threat is not of unlawful action, there seems no possibility of any concurrent tort liability. CONSPIRACY Though our early law knew a writ of conspiracy, this was restricted to abuse of legal procedure and the action on the case in the nature of conspiracy, which came into fashion in the reign of Elizabeth I, developed into the modern tort of malicious prosecution. Conspiracy as a crime was developed by the Star Chamber during the seventeenth century and, when taken over by the common law courts, came to be regarded by them as not only a crime but also as capable of giving rise to civil liability provided damage resulted to  the plaintiff. As a tort, however, it was little developed until the second half of the nineteenth century and the law remained obscure until the decision of the House of Lords in Crofter Hand-Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd . v. Veitch . Conspiracy remains a crime as well as a tort, but the scope of the crime has been curtailed by statute so that, broadly speaking, the only conspiracies which are now indictable are those to commit a substantive criminal offence, to defraud or to corrupt public morals or outrage public decency. The Act, however, has no effect on civil liability. In fact, even aside from the Act the tort and the crime have cut loose from whatever common origin they had. The tort takes two forms according to whether or not unlawful means are used, though the decision of the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ) may have greatly reduced the importance of ‘unlawful means conspiracy.’ Indeed, the Court of Appeal has indicated that the law laid down in Lonrho has effectively resulted in the unlawful means category no longer existing in any meaningful form; but until the law is finally clarified by the House of Lords it seems justifiable to continue to speak of two forms of the tort. Conspiracy to injure It was firmly established in Crofter Hand-Woven Harris Tweed Co. Ltd . v. Veitch that if there is a combination of persons whose purpose is to cause damage to the plaintiff, that purpose may render unlawful acts which would otherwise be lawful. The production of Harris Tweed is an industry of the Isle of Lewis. Originally the yarn for the cloth was hand-spun from wool by the crofters of Lewis and was wholly produced in the Isle. By 1930, handspinning of wool had become commercially impracticable and thenceforth many weavers in Lewis imported yarn from the mainland. Five mill owners in Lewis nevertheless spun yarn woven by the crofters. These mill owners alleged that cloth woven on Lewis from mainland yarn could be sold much more cheaply than cloth made from yarn spun in Lewis. It was therefore in their interest to get a minimum price fixed for the cloth. Of the workers in their mills 90 per cent. belonged to the T.G.W.U. and the Lewis dockers were also members of it. The union, with the object of getting all mill workers to be members and of increasing wages, approached the mill owners, who replied that they could not raise the wages because of the competition of the crofters who wove imported yarn. The union officials then put an embargo on the importation of yarn by ordering Lewis dockers not to handle such yarn. They obeyed (without breaking any contract) and  thus injured the trade of seven small producers of tweed who used imported yarn and who sued the officials for conspiracy. It must be stressed at the outset, lest the importance of this form of liability be exaggerated, that the plaintiffs lost their case because the predominant purpose of the embargo was to promote the interests of the union members rather than to injure the plaintiffs, but their Lordships made it clear that if the predominant purpose of a combination is to injure another in his trade or business or in his other legitimate interests then, if damage results, the tort of conspiracy exists. The Crofter principle was applied by the Court of Appeal in Gulf Oil (Great Britain) Ltd . v. Page in granting an interlocutory injunction against a combination to publish a statement defamatory of the plaintiffs even though the statement was admitted to be true and there would, therefore, have been an absolute defence to an action for libel. (1) Purpose The object or purpose of the combination must be to cause damage to the plaintiff. The test is not what the defendants contemplated as a likely or even an inevitable consequence of their conduct; it is ‘what is in truth the object in the minds of the combiners when they acted as they did?’ Malice in the sense of malevolence, spite or ill will is not essential for liability; what is required is that the combiners should have acted in order that (not with the result that , even the foreseeable result) the plaintiff should suffer damage. If they did not act in order that the plaintiff should suffer damage they are not liable, however selfish their attitude and however inevitable the plaintiff's damage may have been. Cases of mixed motive are common enough in individuals, and it is obvious that a combination of persons may have more than one purpose. Where this is so the question must be asked, what was the real or predominant purpose of the combination, and it is to be answered broadly as by a jury or judge of fact. Difficulty may arise where the purposes of the various parties to the combination are different. If each party has his own private end to gain, but yet the joint aim is no more than a desire for prosperity or peace in industry, there is no tort. On the other hand, if one of the parties is  actuated merely by hatred or vindictive spite he may be liable and if the others are aware of this and lend him their assistance they too may thereby become participants in the wrong. Without such knowledge, however, there can be no conspiracy, since the essence of the tort is an unlawful combination. Another way of expressing the central requirement of conspiracy to injure is to say that the law is concerned with the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate purposes, for the former will legalise the infliction of the most catastrophic and inevitable harm to the plaintiff's business. The legitimate purpose of a combination is sometimes spoken of as its justification (and the expression is convenient) but this does not mean that a combination to do an act harmful to the plaintiff is necessarily actionable unless the defendants prove that it was justified. The burden of proof lies with the plaintiff throughout. On the other hand, there may obviously be cases where the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by proving that he suffered damage from acts done in combination by the defendants the natural and probable outcome of which was damage to him. The defendants may then have to meet this ‘provisional burden’ by adducing evidence that their purpose was something else and that it was legitimate, without affecting the ‘legal burden’of proof. Precise definition of what is and is not a legitimate purpose is probably not possible, but the fact that we live in a competitive or acquisitive society has led English law, for better or worse, to adopt the test of self-interest or selfishness as being capable of justifying the deliberate doing of lawful acts which inflict harm. Acts done to forward or protect the defendants' trade or business interests are clearly justified, but it is not essential that the interest promoted be a material one. In Scala Ballroom (Wolverhampton) Ltd . v. Ratcliffe the plaintiffs refused to admit coloured persons to their ballroom but they did allow coloured musicians to play in the orchestra. The defendants were members of the Musicians' Union, a union with many coloured members, and they gave notice to the plaintiffs that members of the union would not be permitted to play at the ballroom so long as the colour bar was in operation. An injunction to restrain them from persuading their members not to play there was refused. On the other hand, in Huntley v. Thornton damages were awarded against union officials whose object in keeping the plaintiff out of work was, as Harman J. found, to uphold ‘their  own ruffled dignity…. It had become a question of the district committee's prestige; they were determined to use any weapon ready to their hand to vindicate their authority, and grossly abused the quite frightening powers at their command.’ Other examples of unlawful objects are given by their Lordships in the Crofter case. ‘Mere busybodies’ are probably not protected, nor are those who are induced to join a combination by the payment of money and have no other interest to protect. A combination to compel the plaintiff to pay a debt is apparently unlawful, but where the object is to punish him it is necessary to distinguish between mere vindictive vengeance, which is unlawful, and the purpose of deterring others from similarly offending, which apparently is not. If the object is to increase the effective strength of a trade union, it is lawful. The fact that the damage is disproportionate to the purpose sought to be achieved does not itself render the conspiracy actionable; nor is the court concerned with the expediency or otherwise of the policy adopted by the combiners. (2) Combination There must be concerted action between two or more persons, which includes husband and wife. It seems that there can be no conspiracy between an employer and his employees, at least where they merely go about their employer's business. On the other hand, there might be circumstances where an employer would be vicariously liable for a conspiracy involving his servants provided the other requirements of that form of liability are met. There may be a conspiracy between a company and its directors, whose knowledge and purpose may be imputed to the company. (3) Overt act causing damage In contrast with the crime of conspiracy, an overt act causing damage is an essential element of liability in tort. If, therefore, the acts relied on are incapable of being made part of any cause of action —e.g . evidence given by  witnesses in a court of law — then the tort cannot be made out. A sufficient element of damage is shown where expenses are necessarily incurred by the plaintiff in investigating and counteracting the machinations of the defendants. ‘Unlawful means’ conspiracy This form of the tort involves the use of means which are independently unlawful, though not necessarily tortious. For many years its significance was thought to lie in the fact that, while the combiners had to intend to do an unlawful act, it was not necessary that their purpose should be to injure the plaintiff. However, this may have been overturned by the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ). Shell and others constructed an oil refinery in what was then Southern Rhodesia and Lonrho constructed a pipeline thereto from a port in Mozambique. In November 1965 the government of Southern Rhodesia declared unilateral independence and the United Kingdom passed legislation, the ‘sanctions order,’ making it a criminal offence to supply oil to Southern Rhodesia. No further oil was shipped through Lonrho's pipeline, causing the company loss of revenue. The facts to be assumed by the House of Lords for the purposes of the appeal were that Shell and others had, in breach of the sanctions order, covertly supplied Southern Rhodesia with oil by other means and thereby prolonged the state of illegal independence and the time during which Lonrho's pipeline was out of use . It was clear that the breach of the sanctions order gave rise to no action in tort for breach of statutory duty and a claim based on breach of the sanctions order as ‘unlawful means’ for the purposes of the tort of interference with trade failed. The case was also, however, framed as a conspiracy between Shell and others to contravene the sanctions order. This too failed, on the basis that in unlawful means conspiracy, as in conspiracy to injure, there must be an intent to injure the plaintiff, and conspiracy should not be extended ‘beyond acts done in execution of an agreement entered into by two or more persons for the purpose not of protecting their own interests but of injuring the interests of the plaintiff.’ Accordingly, since the case was to be decided on the factual assumption that the purpose of Shell and others in combining to contravene the sanctions order was to forward their own commercial interests, not injure those of  Lonrho, no matter how likely or foreseeable such injury might be, the claim in conspiracy failed. The meaning of the decision in Lonrho has produced radical differences of opinion in courts here and abroad. One view, which is supported by the judgment of Lord Denning M.R. in the Court of Appeal in Lonrho is that ‘it is sufficient if the [unlawful means]conspiracy is aimed or directed at the plaintiff and it can reasonably be foreseen that it may injure him, and does in fact injure him’ and the Supreme Court of Canada has since stated the law in similar terms in a decision in which Lonrho was considered. This would allow for liability where, for example, A and B conspired by unlawful means with the purpose of driving a competitor C out of the market and thereby monopolising it. If such a case involved no unlawful means their ‘purpose’ would be treated as the advancement of their own self-interest or, to put it another way, their object in removing C from the market would be legitimate. To deny such legitimacy in the case where unlawful means were used would still leave some practical scope for this form of conspiracy. This would not mean that A and B are liable for conspiracy wherever they acted unlawfully with the foreseeable consequence that C suffered loss, for conspiracy should not extend further than the other economic torts (for example, interference with contract by unlawful means) where the predominant view is that this is not sufficient. The plaintiff must be the ‘target’ of the combination but if he is, on this view, the advancement of the defendants' own interests does not justify the use of unlawful means. However, subject to further consideration by the House of Lords, this does not now represent English law. In Metall und Rohstoff v. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc . the allegations pleaded (which the court was required to assume to be true for the purposes of an issue as to service out of the jurisdiction) were as follows. Company A, dealers on the Metal Exchange, knowingly assisted an employee of the plaintiffs to engage in fraudulent trading, the result of which was that Company A became exposed to liabilities of more than £6.5m. To protect itself, Company A, at the instigation of Company B, its parent company, falsely asserted that these accounts were the responsibility of the plaintiffs and wrongfully seized certain metal warrants belonging to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs obtained judgment for £50m. against Company A but recovered only £6.7m. since A was insolvent. A further claim for,inter alia , unlawful means conspiracy was brought against Company B but it was not alleged that the predominant purpose of the conspiracy was to injure the plaintiffs since the defendants were obviously concerned to protect their own position. The Court of  Appeal, after a full consideration of Lonrho , held that the omission of an allegation of intention to injure was fatal to the claim. On this basis, it is hard to see what, if anything, a separate category of unlawful means conspiracy adds to the law and while not perhaps strictly abolished by judicial fiat it may be expected to fade away. Lonrho itself is authority for the view that pursuit of naked self-interest by criminal means can never amount to conspiracy. If the wrong agreed on itself amounts to a tort against the plaintiff perhaps little has been lost by the restriction of conspiracy, for the combination must be carried into effect to cause damage and then the substantive tort is committed. Certainly, it is sometimes said that a claim for conspiracy gives the plaintiff procedural advantages, but the reality of this may turn on how far it is to be held on ordinary principles that instigation or procurement suffices to make a person who does not participate in the act a joint tortfeasor. The restriction of conspiracy might seem to put the plaintiff at a disadvantage if the unlawful means is a tort against a third party or the breach of a contract to which the defendant is not a party but this is not necessarily so, for the defendant's procurement of the commission of the tort may again expose him to liability as a joint tortfeasor, and as to a breach of contract he may anyway have committed the substantive tort of interference with an existing contract. In any event, the emergence of the generic tort of interference with trade or business by unlawful means may have had the effect that most cases which were formerly regarded as unlawful means conspiracies amount to torts even without the element of combination. If there is a lacuna in the law it is probably confined to combinations to do acts which amount to crimes but to no other wrong, but the exclusion of such cases from the tort of conspiracy may be a necessary consequence of Lonrho whatever the mental element required for the tort. Place of conspiracy in the law Conspiracy, it has been said, is a highly anomalous tort, though it has attracted more controversy among academic writers than success in practical application. The central issue has been why the ‘magic of plurality’ should make something unlawful if it is not unlawful when done by one person  alone. Numbers may, of course, bring increased power and in the Crofter case Viscount Maugham said that he had never felt any difficulty in seeing ‘the great difference between the acts of one person and the acts in combination of two or of a multitude,’ but, as Viscount Simon L.C. remarked in the same case: ‘The view that the explanation is to be found in the increasing power of numbers to do damage beyond what one individual can do is open to the obvious answer that this depends on the personality and influence of the individual. In the play, Cyrano de Bergerac's single voice was more effective to drive the bad actor Montfleury off the stage than the protests of all the rest of the audience to restrain him. The action of a single tyrant may be more potent to inflict suffering on the continent of Europe than a combination of less powerful persons.’ The argument from numbers continues to have some appeal in the criminal law but there are now few situations in which there may be an indictment for conspiracy in respect of acts which would not be criminal if done by one person. One day the law may re-examine the place in our law of combination and of the ‘chasm’ between lawful and unlawful acts which exists in the case of an individual, but the latest judicial pronouncements suggest a retreat from liability rather than an advance towards a principle that the intentional infliction of harm without justification is actionable. INTERFERENCE WITH TRADE BY UNLAWFUL MEANS Given that the chasm referred to in the previous paragraph is now unbridgeable is there a more modest general principle that it is a tort intentionally to inflict economic harm on another by use of ‘unlawful means?’ There is now authority that, at least where the harm is interference with trade or business, there is such a tort. Its principal practical impact is to fill in the gaps in the other, long-established torts involving unlawful means by imposing liability where there is no combination, no threat and no interference  with a subsisting contract. In J. T. Stratford & Son Ltd . v. Lindley , the facts of which have already been given, two at least of their Lordships considered that if the defendants had used unlawful means —i.e . had committed against the barge hirers the tort of procuring breaches of their contract with their men — the plaintiffs would have had a cause of action not only in respect of breaches of hiring contracts but also in respect of new business they were unable to undertake. ‘In addition to interfering with existing contracts,’ said Lord Reid ‘the defendant's action made it practically impossible for the appellants to do any new business with the barge hirers. It was not disputed that such interference with business is tortious if any unlawful means are used.’ Indeed, this result is an irresistible inference from the acceptance of the tort of intimidation: if it is a tort by A against C to threaten a wrong to B if B continues to deal with C it is hard to see why it should not be equally tortious to inflict harm on C by committing that wrong rather than merely threatening it. More generally, however, this tort has been said to be the genus of which the other unlawful means torts (intimidation and interference with contract and conspiracy where unlawful means are involved) are species. If this is correct, it may be asked why it is necessary to deal with the established, nominate torts at all, to which one can only respond that until the limits of the general tort are clearly established plaintiffs are likely to rely upon as many causes of action as they can, even though from our point of view it is untidy to have two or more torts rather than one. Mental element Like the established economic torts, this is a tort of intention and it is thought that the conduct of the defendant must have the plaintiff as its target though it need not be the predominant purpose in the sense that the defendant needs to be activated by malevolence: the pursuit of self-interest by unlawful means is actionable. Although in some branches of the law a defendant may be treated as intending the known inevitable or likely consequences of his act, that is not so here, for it would stretch the tort too far to impose liability where ‘the reasons which actuate the defendant to use unlawful means are wholly independent of a wish to interfere with the plaintiff's business, such interference being no more than an incidental consequence foreseen by and gratifying to the defendant.’ It must, however, be said that it is by no means crystal clear that this forms the mental element of the ‘species’ torts of unlawful interference with contract and  unlawful means conspiracy (indeed, in the case of the latter it very probably does not) and it is not easy to see how the species can differ in this respect from the genus. Trade or business Beyond the fact that most cases are likely to arise in the context of trade or business it is not apparent why liability should be confined to cases where those activities are interfered with. If it is actionable to use unlawful means to drive away C's prospective customers why should it not equally be actionable to use such means against a person who proposes to buy his house but has not yet signed a contract to do so? If ‘trade or business’ is to be regarded as a requirement of the tort there is a danger that the genus may be narrower than the species. However, it has been suggested that the tort protects only some identifiable legal right. In Lonrho plc v. Fayed the facts which the court was required to assume to be true were that the defendants had made fraudulent misrepresentations about themselves to the Secretary of State in order to influence him not to refer their bid for H.F. Co. to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The plaintiffs contended that they had thereby been deprived of the opportunity to bid for H.F. Co. but pill J. rejected their claim because while the law certainly allowed a freedom to bid for property that was neither a ‘business asset’ of the plaintiffs' nor a legal right which the law would protect. The Court of Appeal, however, declined to deal with this and other points on a striking-out application. Two-party or three-party? As we have seen, at least one form of the established economic torts (intimidation) may exist even though the defendant uses unlawful means directly against the plaintiff rather than against a third party. Is it, therefore, the law that if A steals the tools of a carpenter, B, and locks him up, B may sue for unlawful interference with trade as well as conversion and false imprisonment? Or (assuming breach of contract to be unlawful means) that A is liable in tort if, in order to bring down B, he breaches his contract with him? It is thought that the answer in each case should be ‘no’ because, quite apart from the practical consequences of thus multiplying liability, it would  be a travesty of history to unify these disparate wrongs under one heading of tort. Unlawful means If the law of economic torts is in a mess it is largely because of uncertainty over what constitutes unlawful means. This concept has played the leading role in the development of the modern law but the question of definition has tended to be passed over in the cases with little analysis. Since the broad, ‘genus’ tort is a comparatively recent growth, most of the authorities on unlawful means concern the older, nominate wrongs so that the elements of the former are to some extend rationalisations from the latter and, as we have seen, there is a regrettable element of doubt as to whether ‘unlawful means’bears the same meaning wherever it occurs. Bearing that in mind, it is tolerably clear that conduct which is itself tortious is always unlawful means. The same is probably true of breach of contract but once we move outside the area of wrongs which are civilly actionable in damages the law becomes more uncertain. For example, it has been held that an arrangement void for contravention of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 constitutes unlawful means but this is hard to reconcile with the clear decision in the Mogul case that an agreement in restraint of trade at common law did not. Breach of confidence might qualify as unlawful means (assuming it not to be a tort in itself) but there has been no subsequent support for Lord Denning M.R.'s suggestion that the concept might extend to ‘interference with the press.’ On the other hand, a fraudulent statement to a third party is unlawful means even though the third party could not sue for tort because he suffers no damage. It might seem self-evident that the commission of a crime amounts to unlawful means, but this is not so, at least where the crime is created by statute. This was the first point dealt with by the House of Lords in Lonrho Ltd . v. Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd. (No. 2 ), the facts of which have already been summarised, and in which it was held that the restrictions imposed on the bringing of a direct civil action for breach of a statute could not be outflanked by framing the claim as one for the tort of unlawful interference  with trade. As a matter of strict precedent, however, this aspect of the Lonrho case must have been decided on the same factual assumption as that which governed the conspiracy claim,viz . that while injury to Lonrho's business was foreseeable it was not the defendants' purpose to bring it about. It might, therefore, be open to a court to find liability where a defendant committed a statutory offence as the vehicle for the deliberate infliction of harm upon the plaintiff. In view of the Lonrho decision a similar question might arise with regard to common law crimes which are not also torts in their own right. The closest case on this point is probably Chapman v. Honig where a landlord gave notice to quit to his tenant, the notice being in accordance with the terms of the lease. H's purpose, however, was to punish the tenant for having given evidence (under subpoena ) in an action brought against him by another of his tenants and it followed that the landlord was guilty of a criminal contempt of court. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held, by a majority, that the tenant had no cause of action against the landlord. In coming to this conclusion Pearson L.J. foreshadowed the ‘construction’ approach in Lonrho by treating the common law criminal contempt as if it were created by a hypothetical enactment and asking what intention was to be inferred, with regard to civil liability, from the exercise of the contempt jurisdiction. However, it is not easy to reconcile Chapman v. Honig with Acrow (Automation) Ltd . v. Rex Chainbelt Inc . (where Chapman v. Honig was not cited). Acrow Ltd. obtained an injunction to restrain an American company, S.I., from acting in breach of contract so as to impede Acrow's manufacture of machinery under licence from S.I.S.I. purported to ignore the injunction and instructed Rex Chainbelt, suppliers of components for Acrow's process, to cease supply. This did not involve the breach of any subsisting contract between Acrow and Rex Chainbelt. The Court of Appeal granted an injunction to restrain Rex Chainbelt from obeying S.I. 's instructions: Rex Chainbelt's conduct was interference by unlawful means because it was done in obedience to the orders of S.1. which were in contempt of court. The case may be different from Chapman v. Honig in that the contempt involved was civil not criminal but it is not easy to see  why this should point towards tortious liability. Nor can any distinction be drawn on the basis that there were three persons involved whereas Chapman v. Honig was a ‘two-party’ case, for a true ‘three-party’case only arises where A acts in a manner which is primarily unlawful in relation to B with the purpose of injuring C. In Acrow there was no B. TRADE DISPUTES A general textbook on the law of tort is no place for an extended discussion of the specialised law relating to trade disputes but those disputes have provided most of the ‘raw material’ for the development of the common law and their legal regulation has been so substantially modified by statute since 1906 that some account of the legislative intervention is necessary. Trade Disputes Acts 1906 and 1965 The Trade Disputes Act 1906 was of enormous importance but only the briefest summary of its provisions can be attempted here. The Act: (i) made trade unions completely immune from actions in tort, though it did not affect liability of individuals; (ii) rendered ‘conspiracy to injure’(i.e . without unlawful means) not actionable in the context of trade disputes; (iii) rendered inducement of breaches of contracts of employment not actionable in the context of trade disputes. The Trade Disputes Act 1965 reversed Rookes v. Barnard in trade dispute cases by rendering not actionable a threat to break or induce the breach of a contract of employment. Industrial Relations Act 1971 This Act set out to enlarge the range of civil remedies for wrongful acts done in contemplation or furtherance of ‘industrial disputes,’ but through the new statutory concept of unfair industrial practices, not through the law of tort. Some of these unfair industrial practices were similar to certain varieties of torts and the common law was not wholly abolished. However, the Act was a disastrous failure for political reasons and was repealed by the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974. Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 This Act still forms the basis of legal immunities in trade disputes, though  most of the relevant provisions have in fact been inserted by textual amendment by later legislation. Protection is granted, in the context of a trade dispute, to interference with contract (and not merely a contract of employment), to intimidation or conspiracy to injure and to interference with trade by unlawful means but by the Employment Act 1980 this protection was to a large extent withdrawn in case of‘secondary action.’ Present law (1) Trade unions It will have been observed that nearly all the cases in this chapter arising from industrial disputes have taken the form of actions against individual workers or trade union officials. This is because for many years trade unions themselves were immune from actions in tort. This was not based on the fact that a trade union was an unincorporated body, for in Taff Vale Railway Co . v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants the House of Lords held that a union registered under the Trade Union Act 1871 was enough of a legal entity to be sued in tort. The Taff Vale case was reversed by section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906. After a brief period during which a registered trade union was a corporate body under the Act of 1971, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 restored the immunity, though liability was imposed (where there was no trade dispute) for certain torts causing personal injury or breaches of duty connected with the union's property. It remains the law that a trade union is not, and is not to be treated as if it were, a body corporate, but a much wider measure of tort liability is now imposed by the Employment Act 1982. The central difficulty is that of attributing responsibility to the ‘centre’ in such a ‘devolved’organisation as the typical trade union, bearing in mind the likelihood that ‘unofficial action’will be taken at individual plant level without prior consultation with the union's central organs. The fundamental proposition of the 1982 Act is that the immunity of trade unions in tort is totally abolished, though the union enjoys the same defences as an individual where action is taken in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. However, the range of the union's responsibility for the acts of its officers and members differs according to the nature of the claim which is brought against it. According to section 15 of the 1982 Act, if the union is sued for inducing breach of or interfering with contract, or for intimidation by threats to interfere with contract, or for conspiracy to commit these torts, then the act in question  shall be taken to have been done by the union only if it was authorised or endorsed by a ‘responsible person,’ which means the principal executive committee, any person authorised by the rules to endorse acts of the kind in question, the president or general secretary, any other employed official, or any committee to which an employed official reports, but an act by an official or a committee to which he reports shall not be taken as authorised or endorsed if the official or committee was prevented from authorising or endorsing the act by union rules or if the act has been repudiated by the president or general secretary. In all other cases it would seem that the union's responsibility for the acts of an individual are to be determined by the general law of master and servant or agency. Where the union's liability arises in respect of personal injury caused by negligence, nuisance or breach of duty, or in respect of ownership or possession of property, there is no limit on its amount, but in other cases there are financial limits according to the size of the union. However, damages are not recoverable by enforcement against ‘protected property’(which includes a political fund which is not available for financing strikes and provident benefits fund). Actions for damages (as opposed to injunctions) have not so far figured largely in litigation against individuals caused by industrial action; the limits to union liability set by the 1982 Act are low in relation to the loss that may be suffered and the very large fines imposed for contempt by disobedience to injunctions have probably been a more powerful sanction. (2) Liability of individuals An individual (e.g . a shop steward) is liable for unprivileged acts in the course of a trade dispute, whether or not a trade union is liable. The extent of individual immunity in this context is found in section 13 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as limited, in the case of ‘secondary action’ by the Employment Act 1980. Section 13 in its present form reads as follows: ‘(1) An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort on the ground only —(a) that it induces another person to break a contract or interferes or induces any other person to interfere with its performance; or (b) that it consists in his threatening that a contract (whether one to  which he is a party or not) will be broken or its performance interfered with, or that he will induce another person to break a contract or to interfere with its performance. (4) An agreement or combination by two or more persons to do or procure the doing of any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable in tort if the act is one which, if done without any such agreement or combination, would not be actionable in tort.’ (a) Trade dispute. In order to gain the protection of section 13, the act done by the defendant must be ‘in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.’ This concept, the so-called ‘golden formula,’ is defined in section 29 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, as amended by the Employment Act 1982. It means a dispute between workers and their employer which relates wholly or mainly to one or more of the following: terms and conditions (including physical conditions) of employment: engagement, non-engagement, termination or suspension of employment or of duties of employment; matters of discipline; membership or non-membership of a trade union; facilities for union officials; machinery for negotiation or consultation and other procedures, including recognition of unions. However, by section 10 of the Employment Act 1988 the immunity is withdrawn where the reason or one of the reasons for which the act is done is the fact or belief that the employer is employing non-union labour. Action in support of the ‘closed shop,’ the source of many trade dispute cases, is no longer lawful. A crucial amendment by the 1982 Act was the removal of section 29(4), which provided that a dispute to which a trade union was party should be treated as a dispute to which workers were parties. For this reason, union officials cannot claim the protection of section 13, if, as part of a wider dispute, they initiate industrial action against an employer who is in harmony with his workers. If, however, some support for the union's policy can  be mustered among the plaintiff employer's workers the range of matters covered by section 29 is very wide. In B.B. C . v. Hearn the defendants, in order to protest against apartheid, threatened to instruct the members of their union to commit breaches of contract in relation to broadcast by satellite to South Africa of the 1977 Cup Final. In proceedings for an interlocutory injunction the Court of Appeal held it unlikely that there was a trade dispute, but Roskill L.J. recognised that the situation might well have been different if, instead of the defendants simply threatening to ‘black’ the broadcast they had gone to the B.B.C. and said ‘We wish it to be established as part of our conditions of employment that we are not required to work on broadcasts to South Africa.’ This received the approval of Lord Diplock in N. W. L. Ltd . v. Woods but it has since been remarked that a ‘trade union cannot turn a dispute which in reality has no connection with terms and conditions of employment into a dispute connected with terms and conditions of employment by insisting that the employer inserts appropriate terms into the contracts of employment into which he enters.’ An act is ‘in furtherance’ of a trade dispute when the doer genuinely believes it will assist the cause in support of which it is done: the House of Lords has emphatically rejected the addition of any requirement that the act be ‘not too remote’or ‘reasonably likely to succeed.’ (b) Interference with subsisting contract and intimidation. Section 13(1) protects the most obvious forms of trade union coercion,i.e . inducing breaches of contract and threats to do so. There would, for example, be no liability on facts such as those in Rookes v. Barnard if the threats had been made in support of a wage claim. The protection is not confined to interference with contracts of employment but where the contract affected is not a contract of employment, there are restrictions on the use of ‘secondary action.’ The word ‘only’ is important, for the protection is thereby confined to cases in which the defendant commits no other, incidental tort to procure the breach of contract. If,e.g . he uses words amounting to defamation he is not protected. (c) Conspiracy. Section 13(4) removes ‘conspiracy to injure’ from the  field of trade disputes because it involves an action which would not be actionable in tort if done without agreement or combination. The scope of ‘unlawful means’ conspiracy is also restricted by the requirement that the act should be one which would be actionable in tort if done by one person. Thus an agreement to break a contract may not be actionable. An agreement to induce a breach of contract might be thought to fall outside this protection because inducement is a tort if committed by one person, but this is not so if the inducement is protected by section 13(1). (d) Unlawful interference with trade. This tort is not directly referred to in section 13, except in so far as the ‘nominate’ torts above are species of which it is the genus. Obviously it should not be possible to evade the statutory immunity by pleading the genus and relying on the species as unlawful means, but there would seem to be no statutory protection if the unlawful means take any other form such as nuisance or trespass. A trade union or union official calling its members out on strike is therefore protected but it has been said to be arguable that an individual striker has no protection against a claim that he uses unlawful means when he withdraws  his labour because this situation does not appear to fall within section 13(1). (e) Secondary action. The complex provisions of section 17 of the Employment Act 1980 restrict the scope of the section 13 immunity for secondary action.’ Nothing in section 13 is to prevent an act from being actionable in tort on a ground specified in section 13(1) where (a ) the contract interfered with in respect of which the action is brought is not a contract of employment and (b ) there has been secondary action which does not satisfy the requirements of section 17. Secondary action is action interfering with a contract of employment in one of the ways specified in section 13(1) where the employer under that contract is not a party to the trade dispute. Hence if, in pursuance of a trade dispute between A and C, A induces the employees of B, with whom C has a contract, to break their contracts of employment with a view to bringing about a breach of the contract between B and C the action is presumptively unlawful. However, this is not the end of the matter for the scope of this withdrawal of immunity is limited by the remainder of section 17, which provides three routes through which secondary action may finally be held to be not unlawful. The principal provision is section 17(3) which provides that secondary action is not unlawful it — ‘(a) the purpose or principal purpose of the secondary action was directly to prevent or disrupt the supply during the dispute of goods or services between an employer who is a party to the dispute and the employer under the contract of employment to which the secondary action relates; and (b) the secondary action (together with any corresponding action relating to other contracts of employment with the same employer) was likely to achieve that purpose.’ This was considered by the House of Lords in Merkur Island Shipping Corporation . v. Laughton where, it will be remembered, the I.T.F. union, in dispute with Merkur Island, a flag of convenience shipowner, induced tug-boat crews to refuse, in breach of their contracts of employment, to move Merkur Island's vessel, thereby interfering with the charter of the  vessel to Leif Hoegh. Having said that any removal of the immunity by section 17 enured for the benefit not only of the person against whom the secondary action was taken but also for that of the employer who was party to the trade dispute, Lord Diplock held that the action by I.T.F. was not protected. Merkur Island were not parties to any contract for the supply of towage services, so it was not possible to say that the purpose of the action was to prevent the supply of services between an employer who was party to the dispute (Merkur Island) and the employer under the contract of employment to which the secondary action related (the tug owners). Similar provisions are contained in the Act to govern secondary action aimed at disruption of supply between any person and an associated employer of the employer party to the dispute where the goods or services are in substitution for goods or services which but for the dispute would have fallen to be supplied to or by the employer who is party to the dispute. (f) Picketing. Picketing in various forms has shown itself to be one of the most effective forms of industrial action. At common law it may be unlawful as amounting to a trespass to the highway, or a public or private nuisance, or as involving the inducement or procuring of a breach of contract. However, under section 15 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 it is lawful for a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute to attend at or near his own place of work ‘for the purpose only of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work or abstain from working.’ ‘Secondary action’(e.g . persuading a supplier's lorry driver not to deliver so as to disrupt a commercial contract) is protected if the attendance is lawful under the 1974 Act, but there is no protection for ‘secondary picketing,’i. e . attendance at the premises of the employer's supplier or customer. (g) Ballots. Yet another basis for the removal of the immunity granted by the 1974 Act is to be found in Part II of the Trade Union Act 1984. This requires action taken by a trade union to be supported by a majority in a  secret ballot of all those reasonably expected to take part in the action, and in view of the practicalities of organising a ballot and the fact that advance approval of action is valid for only four weeks puts a serious constraint upon the taking of effective action even where that has overwhelming support. Detailed modifications of the ballot procedure are to be found in sections 12 to 18 of the Employment Act 1988. (h) Injunctions. Where an employer is the victim of industrial action his primary purpose in embarking on litigation is usually (and this is likely to remain the case notwithstanding the extension of tort liability to trade unions) to get an injunction. Since an injunction may be granted on an interlocutory basis pending trial (which may not take place for many months) and, in cases of great urgency, on an ex parte basis, it is clear that there is a possibility of the union side being robbed of the initiative in an industrial action. To meet this point, section 17 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 contains two provisions. First, where an application for an injunction is made ex parte and the defendant claims, or in the opinion of the court would be likely to claim, that he acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, the court shall not grant the injunction unless satisfied that all steps which in the circumstances were reasonable have been taken with a view to securing that notice of the application and an opportunity of being heard with respect to the application have been given to him. This reduces the risk of the defendants in a ‘labour injunction’ case being taken unawares, but contains nothing about how the court should proceed when both parties are before it. At the time when the 1974 Act was passed it was thought that the issue on an application for an interlocutory injunction was whether the plaintiff had established a prima facie case, but in American Cyanamid Ltd . v. Ethicon Ltd . the House of Lords held that the test was rather more favourable to the plaintiff, was there ‘a serious question to be tried?’ To meet this development section 17(2) was inserted into the Act and provides that where an application is made for an interlocutory injunction and the party against whom it is sought claims that he acted in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, the court shall, in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant the injunction, have regard to the likelihood of that party's succeeding at the trial of the action in establishing the matter which would afford a defence under the Act. Under the American Cyanamid decision the court must ask itself whether the plaintiff has shown (a ) a serious question to be tried and (b ) that the ‘balance of convenience’ is in his favour. It is not very clear whether section 17(2) adds a third element or is subsumed in (b ), but it is clear that it was intended to be more difficult to obtain an interlocutory injunction in trade  dispute cases than in others. If the affidavits suggest that it is more likely than not that the defendant would succeed in establishing a statutory immunity that is a weighty factor in favour of refusing to grant an injunction. It has been suggested that now that unions (and not merely officials) may in certain circumstances be liable in damages for unlawful industrial action it is more likely that an employer will pursue his claim to a full trial and there is less reason to refuse an interlocutory injunction in trade dispute cases; but it has also been said that the ‘right to strike’ is a valuable (indeed essential) element in the system of collective bargaining and that it ‘should not be rendered less valuable than Parliament intended by too fanciful or ingenious a view of what might develop into a serious issue to be tried.’"
ACA ACA-HXH-001 3.48 "Deciding what to write about, and getting started 1.1 THE PURPOSE OF WRITING ESSAYS As prescribed coursework, essays in literary studies generally require you to carry out two related tasks. First, they invite you to show that you are familiar with the basic, raw material which makes up the subject — whether this is a work, a series of works, a literary theory, the historical context of an author or what critics have said about something. Secondly, they invite you to show that you can manipulate that basic, raw material to argue a case, in ways consistent with established frameworks of literary-critical debate. Many students' essays demonstrate that their writers know the relevant material; however, the essays do not demonstrate this knowledge within a coherent or developing argument. Such essays are usually judged to be lacking a necessary dimension for achieving high marks. So the second task of essay-writing — arguing a case — is important. But what does ""arguing a case"" mean for a literary studies essay? Much of this book is devoted to showing in detail what ""arguing a case"" means in literary studies; and the notion of ""argument"" will recur in the chapters which follow. Here we need only to establish a rough and preliminary guide. Arguing a case involves the following four stages: — identifying a problem or issue in a given area; — establishing competing points of view associated with the issue identified; — presenting evidence in support of and against various positions which might be taken up with regard to the issue; — reaching a conclusion consistent with the evidence and arguments you have presented. It is the fundamental skills of problem-identification, analysis and debate which are usually perceived by examiners and potential employers as the main achievement of literary studies. The persuasive and analytic skills you develop are applied during your course to literary works and issues; but they have the additional value that they are potentially transferable to other problems and circumstances. Alongside the development of these skills, the subject matter of your essays offers an additional benefit. Because it is concerned with questions of meaning, social behaviour and structure, and problems of cultural value, it directs you not only towards a wide range of examples of writing but also towards a greater awareness of moral and social questions underlying the techniques through which analysis and persuasion are achieved. Once this basic way of tackling literary studies is clear, many of the more specific problems facing you as you answer an exam question or devise an essay topic will begin to fall into place. With the larger objectives slightly clearer, what you have to do is to work out how these are achievable in terms of the wide array of topics presented to you, or in terms of possible topics you are invited to define for yourself. 1.2 WHAT SORTS OF TOPICS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE In most cases, when you write an essay you largely decide for yourself what to write about. Even where you have to answer set questions — as in an exam — a choice between alternatives usually has to be made; and not only do you have to pick a particular question to answer, but you also have to decide exactly what it is that the question is asking you to do. In deciding what a question involves, you need first to identify where it fits into the range of ESSAY GENRES (or ""essay idioms"" ) which are defined by the conventions of literary studies as a discipline. Once you can identify where it fits, you have a general framework in which to tackle it — or which you can challenge if you wish to. We begin this chapter, accordingly, by looking at the different types of literary essay it is possible to write, considering first the variety of focus they give to their subject matter and the different modes of argument they adopt. A literature essay always has a focus for its subject matter (e.g. on the novels of Angela Carter, the role of ""fool"" characters in drama, or the origins of free verse), and it also uses a particular mode of argument (e.g. stylistic analysis, contrast and comparison, or historical contextualisation). To begin with, then, we need to identify the different kinds of focus and modes of argument that are possible, so that you can gain a general sense  of the elements which are combined together in an essay in literary studies. focus (i): Authors examples ""The life and works of Edgar Allen Poe"" ; ""women Romantic poets"" . focus (ii): Texts examples Coleridge's ""Kubla Khan"" ; Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man; poems by Sylvia Plath. focus (iii): Generic groupings of texts examples The sonnet; eighteenth-century pastoral poetry; kitchen-sink drama. focus (iv): Historical issues relating to a selected text or group of texts: examples The specifically nineteenth-century idea of beauty in the nineteenth-century novel; developments in the theatre immediately before the English Civil War; representations of industrial life in early twentieth-century novels. focus (v): Theoretical issues relating to literary study: examples Comparison of post-structuralist approaches to the lyric poem; the mental processes involved in construing a metaphor; why it is possible to have manipulations of point-of-view in narrative. Consider now the various kinds of argument which can be used in approaching these points of focus in your material and making something new and interesting from them: mode of argument (a): Revalue a reputation (or assess relative achievement); example An extended essay which argues that Josephine Tey is a major Scottish writer, and that she has been neglected because she wrote detective fiction. mode of argument (b): Analyse style: comment on aspects of the language of a text. example An essay pointing out that Shakespeare's first sonnet ends with a comma in the first printed edition and arguing that this is because it is the first part of a larger poem including also the second sonnet. mode of argument (c): Relate a text to the historical circumstances which produced it, or in which it is read. example A dissertation which looks at the relation between the spread of tourism in the countryside in the eighteenth century and the development of a new style of ""countryside"" poetry as exemplified in Wordsworth and Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads published near the end of that century. mode of argument (d): Place a text in a literary or aesthetic context (e.g. in a tradition, in the emergence of a new form or style). example A thesis arguing that Robert Louis Stevenson should be understood as an early example of twentieth-century Modernism rather than as a late example of nineteenth-century Realism. mode of argument (e): Describe or interpret (or reinterpret) a text. For example, you could interpret the meanings of events in a narrative, starting with a description of what happens at an apparently realistic level, then interpreting the events as having an alternative, symbolic meaning. Description and/or interpretation includes some of the kinds of activity involved in an exercise called ""Practical Criticism"" , which entails commenting on prose passages and poems. example An essay which describes the narrative of Alasdair Gray's novel Lanark and interprets it as a symbolic representation of the state of contemporary Scotland. mode of argument (f): Take sides in an ongoing critical argument between differing viewpoints. Summarise the different cases made in a controversy, then conclude by taking one side or another. Since critical controversies can surround virtually any aspect of a text or movement, essays along these lines can take many forms. example A thesis which investigates made-up words (which resemble slips of the tongue) in Joyce's Finnegans Wake, compares literary theoretical approaches with experimental psychological approaches, and concludes that the psychological approaches undermine the validity of the literary theoretical approaches. mode of argument (g): Exemplify theories, terms or approaches, or use a classificatory system to describe a text (usually in order to reflect back on how suitable or effective the descriptive system is). example An essay showing that the linguistic theory of Conversational Analysis can help us understand how characters in Conrad's novels control each other through the ways they interact in speech. A simple combination of a selected focus with one of the modes of argument outlined above would be an essay with a focus on Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man [focus (ii)], which argues that it is underrated as a novel and indicates why it should be seen as a greater achievement [mode of argument (a)]. More than one focus can be adopted in any given essay, and different modes of argument can be combined; the evaluation of Invisible Man could involve a stylistic argument, so combining mode of argument (a) and mode of argument (b). But while a single essay might draw in this way on more than one perspective, it is important to establish which is the primary or organising mode of argument and what is the primary focus around which an essay is based. Otherwise you may obscure the development of your essay by failing to distinguish its overall direction. Many essays suffer from exactly this problem: they lack a clear sense of what the main issues are which are being addressed. Other essays are damaged by what appears to be an opposite problem, but is actually a result of the same lack of structure: they read as if they are trying to solve two or more problems at once. RESPONDING TO SET QUESTIONS If you have to devise your own topic, you can do so by selecting and combining from the lists of different approaches above. But even when you are constrained by having to answer a question set for you, it is useful to bear in mind the range of possible essay genres, so that you can decide exactly which combination of focus and mode of argument you are required to adopt. Finding an appropriate form in which to present your argument is a major part of the process of writing an essay, and our aim in these sections is to help you develop strategies for making sure that your essay has a directed and coherent structure. Coursework and examination questions are an idiom in themselves. The idiom is worth learning to understand in order to develop a sense of how you should respond to the (often hidden) questions inside an examination or coursework question. Here are some words which are commonly used in essay and exam questions, grouped according to the basic types of writing which they might be asking you to do. In this book we will look at the kinds of things you have to do to respond to each type of question. This is partly a matter of writing appropriate sentences, for example, so that you can distinguish your point of view in debate from someone else's. And it is partly a matter of organising paragraphs — how, for example, to organise a comparison. And it is partly a matter of knowing where to find help: how to find examples and how to work out all the possibilities of a classification. In the meantime, note the following features of the use of the words listed above. The term ""discuss"" invites debate, where debate means reasoned presentation of arguments for and against a proposition, with a conclusion — no matter how qualified or tentative — reached at the end. Words like ""explain"" , ""justify"" and ""assess"" are used to focus your attention on causation and evidence; you should not only describe what you have read but also offer an analysis of why you take the view of it you do.  ""Give examples"" (or the related, ""with reference to not less than two texts…"" ) invites you to present concrete illustration, which should generally include quotation and paraphrase (of episodes or incidents from the text) to support the points you make. We can accordingly make a general summary of the tasks you are being invited to perform in response to essay questions. You are to discuss a proposition, offering and evaluating arguments with appropriate illustration on different sides; the arguments should lead towards a conclusion which (1) follows the arguments you have offered, and (2) matches the balance of possibilities which you argued for in your essay. 1.4 EXAM QUESTIONS It is helpful to bear in mind these recurrent instruction words ( ""discuss"" , ""assess"" , etc.) as you contemplate in an examination a list of questions that you have to choose between. But it is also necessary to link up these instruction words with other aspects of questions. So in this section, we look more closely at how whole exam questions (illustrated here from  recent University of London examination papers) are structured, before considering some more general exam-room strategies. There are several different categories of exam questions:(a) Questions on given passages How appropriate is the form/style of the following passage? By what means, stylistic and other, does the author attempt to establish the character of the narrator in the following passage? Write a critical analysis of the following poem. Diction, rhythm, rhyme and syntax may be of special interest. Often you will be asked in this sort of question to discuss passages you have not seen before. But since the examination is testing what skills you have developed over time, the passage is likely to be similar in some way to passages which you have seen. Sometimes the similarity is hinted at in the question itself; for example, you may have looked at another passage involving characterisation and this will guide you in looking at this one. But while you will usually be expected to remember other pieces you have seen before — and how you analysed them — you should not discuss those other passages in your answer (unless you are explicitly instructed to, which none of the above questions do). Use what you have learned only as background, or as a model; concentrate on isolating suitable phrases or passages for comment, and on drawing general observations from them. (b) Questions which explicitly invite debate, and the weighing of evidence (these might be called ""to what extent"" or ""discuss"" questions)  ""Bakhtin's dialogic reading can defuse scepticism about the possibility of meaning.""  Discuss.  ""Feminism involves both the affirmation and the critique of female identity.""  Discuss. To what extent should Heaney's poetry be described and assessed in terms drawn from his own critical essays? Even if the question doesn't specifically warn you about it, by saying ""to what extent…"" , you should generally find that the answer is not at one end or the other, but somewhere in the middle. And be especially careful with formulations of the kind illustrated in the examples below; do not be misled by a direct interrogative — the answer is never just a long version of ""yes"" or ""no"" :  ""Psychoanalytic criticism can merge with other kinds of reading without supplanting them: it can underpin without undermining.""  Have you found this to be so? Is ""warm-heartedness"" an adequate epitome of Dickens's social theory? Can there be a ""science of the text"" ? Some writers on such questions unwisely respond with aggressive disagreement to the proposition being put. Unwisely, because the question doesn't usually involve a genuine opinion, but rather a constructed or quoted one which is being used to provoke reaction. (The examiners are asking you to show that you have a view and can justify it, whatever it is; they are not asking to be attacked for holding the view outlined in the question, which they probably don't hold anyway.) (c) Other specific types of question In what ways can Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry be regarded as subversive? With this type of question, be careful not just to make a list. Pay particular attention to the relationship between the different ways you identify, and be as explicit as you can about the connections between them. Differentiate the mimetic and/or dramaturgic procedures used in two or more of Shakespeare's last plays. With this type of question, you are asked to identify and compare. As you do so, try to build up a system of classification, explaining your basis for making distinctions. Are Shakespeare's last plays more concerned with the absence of families or with absent families? With such questions, a major task lies in unpacking the word-play, and making clear the distinctions you are drawing from the formulation of the question. You could begin your essay by acknowledging this and continue to work with the definitions throughout the essay, relating the different definitions together in the conclusion. Consider some of the expressive purposes of the rendition of places in Henry James's work. This question only asks you to consider ""some"" of James's expressive purposes. Words like ""some"" in examination questions are there to show that examiners don't think exhaustive answers are possible; any response will be partial. But this does not mean you should limit yourself in how many expressive purposes you discuss. Discuss all the ""expressive purposes"" you can think of. (d) General invitations — but to what? Write on Jonson's use of location in any three of his works. Write on Milton's humour. With these apparently vague questions it is necessary to make clear your own interpretation of what ""write"" means. Roughly, you can take it as synonymous with ""describe and discuss"" . The special difficulty here is that since relatively little essay structure is signalled by the question itself, in your first paragraph you will have to make very clear to your examiner what shape you are imposing on your discussion. (e) Complex questions ""In natural objects we feel ourselves, or think of ourselves, only by likenesses — among men too often by differences"" (Coleridge). In the light of this statement consider the presentation of the relationship between the self and the world in the work of any one writer of the period. This rather convoluted question fits a particular pattern which it is useful to familiarise yourself with:(a) a quote captures a general perception; then (b) you are asked about some other writer (or invited to select a writer) where it is plausible to think the quote may be relevant; then (c) you are asked to discuss this second writer in the light of the quote. Note that your essay in this case is not centrally concerned with Coleridge; in fact you will almost certainly do less well if you write about Coleridge than if you discuss a different author. We can sum up this discussion of exam questions with the following pieces of guidance (in Chapter 5, we consider in more detail how you actually write the passages which perform the functions we suggest here): * Write an introductory paragraph, but don't use it as a way to put off answering the question. Instead, use the first paragraph as an opportunity to translate the question into your own words. But don't use the same wording as in the question and don't translate ""word for word"" ; reformulation and reorganisation will force you to understand the question and show your examiner that you do. Translate technical words into ordinary language wherever possible. * Where a question seems broad or general, explain how you are interpreting it in order to make it more manageable. * The question may not tell you to give examples, but you should, and you should show how the examples relate to your answer. * The question may not directly ask you for a conclusion, but give one anyway. * Don't talk about yourself or comment on the exam unless you are explicitly asked to. 1.5 EXAM TECHNIQUES AND STRATEGIES Writing an exam answer is like writing a homework essay question, with some differences which point to strategies you should learn. It is helpful, for example, to look at past questions, bearing in mind that there is usually only a limited range of possible questions which are likely to be asked about any given topic. In the examination itself, divide up the time on the basis of how the marks are likely to be distributed; if you run out of time for your first answer, quickly sketch a conclusion and move on to the next question, so that you have provided at least a general indication of work in all the questions. (More marks are typically lost by failing to write one answer altogether than by presenting two or three answers which are slightly weaker than you would have wished.) Keep your paper tidy (for example, by deleting all notes at the end), but don't use correcting fluid to remove errors (it is a sure way of telling your examiner that you want to focus on appearance at the expense of content). By way of general preparation, it can also be useful to prepare material in component prefabricated ""packages"" before the exam itself. When you come to answer an exam question, remember that it is probably asking you to carry out a number of different tasks. Begin by jotting down what you think they are, plus any thoughts this triggers off. This stage resembles planning your essay outline, and could give you your necessary paragraph headings (particularly since an exam essay gives room for only a few paragraphs). The question is now in simpler units which you can address in turn. These might include: — problems put into the formulation of the question — words which need definition or explanation, for example; — established views on the issue raised by the question, which you will have learned about in the class or by your own reading; — examples which you can use to illustrate specific points (list the points which each example illustrates); — crucial technical terms which you need to introduce (e.g. an appropriate vocabulary for describing the rhyme scheme of a poem); — historical context which needs to be introduced in order to answer a question about a writer from an earlier period. Establish in your mind the scope and boundaries of the material which will be relevant, bearing in mind the formulation of the question ( ""choose two plays by Shakespeare"" , etc.). Divide up the time available for the question, so that your answer, though short, is still properly proportioned. 1.6 DEVISING YOUR OWN TITLE The titles you choose for essays you devise yourself can, if you want them to, be made closely to resemble the sorts of questions you are set as prescribed essays or in exams. Accordingly, when you have identified the areas in common, and the divergences, between exam questions and essay topics of your own, you can draw appropriately on skills you have learnt in one kind of work while doing another. With this in mind, we now consider some of the distinct characteristics of essay titles. A title is a statement encapsulating the main points of an argument; in most cases, it could be rewritten in the form of a question that is being answered by your essay. The title Undervalued achievement: the contribution of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction. could be used for an essay which is an answer to the question Assess the contribution made by Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction. or to the question ""The contribution made by Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man to the development of African-American fiction is undervalued.""  Discuss. In this way, titles can be the mirror image of examination questions. They are phrases which indicate a topic of interest (i.e. your focus) and at the same time point towards a particular kind of discussion (i.e. your mode of argument). Accordingly, your title needs not only to indicate what the essay will be about, but also the point of view it will adopt concerning whatever it is about. In the example above, the phrase ""Undervalued achievement"" does this. There are certain typical characteristics of the form of essay and dissertation titles which you can build on. Note, for example, the common form ""title plus sub-title"" : The Text and the Reader: Construction of meaning in advertising texts (title of a Master's thesis). Marx and Spenser: Elizabeth and the problem of Imperial Power (draft title of a PhD thesis). The formula here involves the combination of two different styles: a main title, in a verbally adroit, catchy form; and a gloss or explanatory paraphrase, couched in more orthodox academic language. In devising titles, avoid over-florid forms, however, as well as epigraphs (i.e.  quotations placed between the title and the main body of text), since these can make the essay appear to aspire to a grandeur or scale that it cannot in the circumstances fulfil. Such titles and ornamentation can create the effect of bathos, or comic undermining of what you do achieve. The same applies to acknowledgements (and other devices common in full-length books) if they are used in short essays. If in doubt, keep it simple. As possible alternatives to the ""title plus sub-title"" pattern, consider whether your own title could be a phrase or sentence. Compare: How readers construct the meaning of advertising texts. A Marxist analysis of the imperialist politics of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene Simply formulating a title of some sort can be a useful achievement, in that it helps you decide how you want to focus your writing. As you write the essay you may find that the focus shifts, with the result that you end up rejecting the original title and finding a more suitable one. This common experience recommends the approach to writing which says that you should start immediately by writing your ideas down, being prepared to discard them later when your thinking has evolved beyond your early plan. More generally, it illustrates how everything you do — even your choice of a title — is a part of your thinking about your essay, and contributes to its development. 1.7 BEING ORIGINAL Whatever you write, it should be in some sense original. But ""originality"" presents a difficult problem because (unless you are doing advanced research) you are unlikely to be in a position to advance new facts or radically new interpretations, or even to have a wide enough knowledge of what other people have written to be sure that you are not duplicating it. This is especially likely to be the case with short essays and exam answers, where you clearly cannot be expected to be ""original"" in the sense in which a researcher or expert in the field might be expected to be. But you will, nevertheless, be expected to be original in the sense of using your own knowledge and independent judgement to argue an original case. Your case gains its originality from the way in which you compare and weigh the different strengths and weaknesses of existing arguments in relation to the text or texts being discussed, and by choosing different examples from those presented in works you have read or lectures you have attended. Faced with the challenge of being original in this way, some student writers believe that they should copy or adapt other people's work because it is bound to be of better quality than their own. This is inappropriate for a number of reasons: first, because you are primarily assessed on relative quality ( ""good for a second-year dissertation"" ) rather than absolute quality; second, because there is no point in simply rewriting someone else's ideas (you might as well submit their original book or article instead); and third, because it underestimates the possibilities of disagreement, adaptation and development which exist in all areas of the field. Homage to the achievement of established authors, expressed in the form of direct copying, is not an accepted mode of writing essays or dissertations in (for example) British universities and colleges. Therefore, it is important in your essay always to identify what is original and what is not. This is not just a matter of showing that you are not stealing or plagiarising other people's work. At least as important is the process of making explicit the argument structure of your essay. By acknowledging sources, you show the foundations for the speculations or conclusions you yourself are adding. If you simply insert other people's material unacknowledged into your own, another danger arises, too: that your writing becomes structurally incoherent (something we discuss further in Chapter 5, pp. 109–10). 1.8 PLANNING AN ESSAY: FORMAT AND PROPORTION In order to think ahead about your essay or dissertation you need to consider its overall length and the length of the parts which comprise it. This means making decisions very early on about the contents of the whole essay (e.g. by writing an initial synopsis). As in the case of the title, it is of course, possible — and sometimes necessary — to change the synopsis as you progress. You just need something to start you off that can then be modified as you go along. How much should you write? Below, we indicate some typical essay lengths. (You may find that your course, college or university has rules for upper and lower limits, so check these before you start.) Unless you are using a word-processor with a word-count facility, there is little point counting every word. An estimate is enough. Work out an average number of words per line and lines per page, and this will give you a typical number of words per page. Multiplying this by the number of pages is enough to show a rough total, which should tally adequately with tutors' estimates and impressions (since they won't count the individual words either). When you have noted the overall length you need to produce, divide this length into suitable proportions for your argument, so that not only will you not run out of space but the essay will have a ""balance"" as it develops, with worked-out proportions being given to each stage. This means deciding from the beginning a rough breakdown of the parts of your final essay: to achieve this, you should write an OUTLINE. Then you can assign half a page to an introductory paragraph, one page to the summary of what other people have said, etc. If you have a detailed outline of the structure and proportions, then if the essay becomes too long, you can work out more precisely where deletions need to be made: take out redundant or duplicated examples; cut lists shorter, reduce alternative words offered as glosses, etc. In this way you can shorten your essay without losing its balance or structure (which would happen if you just cut the end, for example). 1.9 GETTING STARTED: OUTLINES AND EARLY DRAFTS Speculating about your essay is one thing; actually starting to write it is another. If you look at your first blank page and freeze, how do you unfreeze yourself and get started? In this section we look at some ways of doing this, and more generally of getting from the planning stage to the writing stage. There is of course no single correct way; everyone writes differently. One productive starting point is to break the illusion that writing is a ""gestation"" process of waiting for inspiration until the essay forms itself, fully-fledged, in your mind and just needs to be written down. Even in exam situations, there needs to be some initial planning and rough drafting before starting on the main process of composition. But generally it is a good idea to start writing in some form as soon as you can. Be willing to do disposable work. Versions which you know you are going to throw away often allow you to experiment in ways that you wouldn't risk in a draft you consider ""final"" or ""near final"" . By thinking that everything is final — that it must pass your own ""quality control"" test — you greatly reduce the likelihood of producing any work at all. Remember that in the production of texts for non-examined purposes (e.g. committee reports, novels, paintings, films), rough versions, sketches and drafts are the norm. So there is no reason why you shouldn't do a rough-cut, followed by a fine-cut, before you start on your final version. This is not necessarily an increase in your workload: drafting and redrafting allows lower-intensity and less stressful work than packing everything into a single and decisive act of composition. It is also useful if someone is prepared to read your rough versions. This need not be your tutor; even someone who knows nothing about the subject can say whether you are making sense. Break down the process of constructing an essay into easy small steps. Make notes, draft paragraphs, keep rewriting short outlines. Each step you take provides scaffolding which will enable you to build the essay a little further. You note your arguments on a piece of paper; they look wrong, so you edit the notes, making them clearer or more coherent. The next day, as you come at the problems with a fresh eye (or at least from a slightly different angle), the notes look wrong again, but this time for slightly different reasons. So you do further editing. The text evolves, through successive steps of minor redrafting rather than through the more mysterious process of gestation, and with less chance of outside events or circumstances making you forget where you have got to. Make a timetable. Step-by-step writing allows you to do this, and commits you to making progress, even if later you discard what you have done. Bear in mind other commitments when outlining your programme of work (e.g. holidays, weekends, need for rest, etc.). Be realistic from the outset, so that you don't become dismayed by your inability to keep to your own timetable. As part of the process of writing from the very beginning, and writing in small steps, from the first day you should write down, and keep available, notes consisting of a few sentences on each of the following:(a) the essay's hypothesis (the claim it is interested in exploring);(b) the evidence or data you are going to use (the facts, quotes, parallel cases from other texts, etc., that you are in the process of collecting);(c) brief statements of your ideas so far;(d) in the case of a longer dissertation, the preliminary results of a ""literature search"" (a survey of bibliographies to find things to read). The value of having such materials in brief and physically separate forms is that it is easier to manipulate ideas while they are still in note form than it is once you have written them out in prose. A note-form outline of the essay provides a clear conceptual structure, and offers you an overview, which — when inspected closely — should allow you to assess how coherent it is, and how clearly it moves to your conclusion. Sometimes, it can be useful to write each main point in the argument on a separate card or sheet of paper, and physically reorder them on a table in front of you, joining up the points in your mind with a linking commentary. (How do you get from this point to this? What is it that makes you want to put one point before another?) Before working on anything else write a one-paragraph SYNOPSIS (a summary of your essay's argument). Keep your synopsis handy all the time you are writing, and edit it periodically (because writing your argument down will probably change it). A useful test is to imagine that you are at a party and someone asks you what you are writing about: your answer will have to be short, coherent and sufficiently interesting to hold the attention of a listener who does not have to listen to you. The best answer you can give in these circumstances should provide the shape for your synopsis. Remember to focus. What is important is that your essay needs to be made up of logical or structural relations between points (e.g. cause and effect, consequence, incompatibility, counter-example), not just of a list. As we suggest in more detail in Chapters 2 and 3, you will be able to find materials more easily and see the best arrangement for them when you have formed a sense of what you are looking for. Most fields are too large to research convincingly, unless you go into them with at least a provisional focus. With a guiding aim, you tend to read with a goal or personal agenda; what you read falls into place, at least relative to a notion of what your interest in the field is, or what perspective you wish to adopt on it. Keep the idea of ""perspective"" in mind, since it indicates that for your purposes some materials and pieces of information will appear ""in the foreground"" ; others are only ""background"" , further away from your centre of interest. Clearly, you need to use the time you have available to consolidate what is going to be in the foreground — what is central to your essay — rather than in mugging up materials which at best can only ever form marginal elements of the final piece of work. Finally, consult essays already successfully submitted. Just as you can prepare for an exam by looking at old exam questions, so you can prepare to write a dissertation by looking at previous examples which have been  submitted and accepted by your institution. Studying these should ensure that you are not completely ignorant of the scope, length, format and demands of what you are trying to do. 1.10 SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF AS YOU CONSTRUCT AN ESSAY As you begin to write your outline or first sketch, make each of the two following types of plan: — a one-page plan describing what you are going to do and the order you intend to do it in (a PROCEDURAL PLAN);— a one-page plan outlining what your essay should look like when it is finished (a STRUCTURAL PLAN). If it seems easier, write your plans as simple diagrams, with different parts connected by arrows. It is important, though, to limit the size of the plans (e.g., to less than a page each), so that you keep a simple overview. The structure of your project needs to be visible, almost at a glance. To decide what should go into these two plans, think your way carefully through the following general questions, which should either suggest fresh ideas to you or else persuade you that your proposed topic is unrealisable. What are the questions I want to answer? Try to formulate these as questions rather than just phrases describing an area of interest. example If you start from an area of interest which is ""Irony in Jane Austen's novel Emma"" , try to work out some questions to ask, such as, ""Do any of the characters in Emma deliberately use irony?"" ;  ""Which characters use irony, and which don't?"" ;  ""Is there a distinction between the way men use irony and women use irony in Emma?"" , etc. What is the main or central question that I wish to address? A collection of questions will not necessarily give you a coherent focus for your essay, so you need to encapsulate as many as you can in a single basic question. example Which types of characters in Emma use irony and why? What kinds of answers am I looking for? Make as full a list as possible of what kinds of answer would be possible (to your main question and also to your other questions), so that you can at least consider candidates that your essay may then reject. example The question ""Which types of character in Emma use irony and why?"" is actually two questions. Answering the first part involves classifying characters into types, so it is useful to think of all types which might be relevant in answering the question — male versus female, old versus young, poor versus rich, and as many more as you can think of. Some of these may immediately appear irrelevant, but it is necessary to consider them briefly, if only to rule them out. Answering the second part, ""why?"" depends on the answer to the first part. But it is useful anyway to speculate about possible findings and so some possible explanations; the characters who use irony might be similar in type to Austen herself (in class, gender, age); or they might be the characters who function as heroes and heroines in the novels. Each of these answers raises further questions. This is exactly how you can build your essay, as a sequence of questions and answers. What methods will help me find answers? Your essay needs to provide evidence or reasons for your point of view. All the time you ought to be asking yourself: ""why should anyone believe what I am writing?"" and ""what have I noticed in the text or in background, contextual materials that makes me think this?""  Even if your reasoning is self-evident to you, it won't be to other people, who will come at the issue from a slightly (or very) different point of view. example How can you show your reader that you have made an exhaustive survey of the characters in Emma and whether they use irony or not? Drawing up a list of all speaking characters is an obvious start, with a note of pages on which they speak, and to whom. Putting all this into a diagrammatic table might be a good way to gather data so that you can see clearly if there are generalisations. You can put the table into your essay, if the information turns out to be significant. What books or articles do I already know that address my main question? Draw up a list, look on the library shelves, and once you have the books in your hands, consult the index and bibliography of each for further ideas. How can I draw boundaries round, or limit the scope of my chosen field? Bear in mind that background material expands infinitely, and needs to be closed off somewhere to prevent you becoming submerged in an endless and unfinishable project. Take note, in examinations, of how boundaries are suggested in questions, such as ""with reference to at least two works"" , or ""with reference to works by at least two authors"" . With larger projects, take care not to include everything you are interested in, just to bring it in somewhere. example Avoid the ""Jane Austen, gender, class, early nineteenth-century society and the development of the novel"" type of project, which inevitably lacks a clear focus. What is the relationship between my central question and current work in this subject area? It is possible that the question you are asking is different from the sorts of discussion you have encountered in what you have read on the subject. If so, indicate that you recognise this, if possible with an explanation of how. Or it may be that the question you are interested in has been discussed before, but that you want to develop it in a particular way, or to extend it, or to disagree with one of its premises. Again, indicate this, as precisely as possible. Establishing how your work fits into debate in the area is an important function of essay-writing in literary studies; generally speaking, you need to know why and how your work matters. example For the Emma essay, you could look in a bibliography for a link between ""irony"" and ""Austen"" and ""characterisation"" ; you could scan some collections of essays on Austen or Emma for possibly relevant material; similarly you could look in books on irony, in order to see how closely your ideas resemble existing material, and what aspects are original. Am I sufficiently interested in my question or topic to keep me interested over the necessary time period? With examination questions you have little choice. But you also have only a little time. Some pieces of work, on the other hand, require a lot of reading and study time during composition; and for these you are likely to produce better work if you choose questions that genuinely interest you, or connect with problems you are in any case interested in outside your literary work, rather than if you feel your work is being done out of obligation or under duress. Be wary, though, of topics involving issues in  which you are personally very deeply immersed. If you feel it will be difficult to stand back sufficiently to carry out the sorts of procedures we have discussed in this chapter, then it may be best to avoid them. example If you have a general political interest in social class, this could support an investigation of class as it relates to characters' use of irony in Emma. What kinds of benefits — personally and as a student — are likely to result from investigating my chosen topic? Evaluate what contribution the project can make to your grade or course requirement, and also what contribution it can make to your thinking or personal growth. 1.11 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter, we have suggested that how you present the evidence and arguments which make up your case about a problem or issue is at least as important in literary studies as the particular viewpoint you adopt, and counts as originality. Exam and essay questions come in a range of identifiable idioms, and there are established conventions for responding to them. Essays need to be constructed, not just written; so time spent on an initial outline establishing an essay's structure prevents problems of shape and proportion when the essay as a whole is written. Specific suggestions * If you are stuck for a topic, look at our description of the range of possible points of focus and modes of argument, and construct your essay by choosing and combining these established idioms (pp. 11–12). * Make sure you have a single basic question you are trying to answer (p. 13). * Learn the ""language"" of examination and set essay questions, so that you know how to ""speak"" suitable answers (pp. 15–17). * Break your essay into parts, in advance of writing it, and continuously update and revise your description of its structure. Decide what proportion of the essay each part requires (pp. 18, 22–4). * Start to write immediately; use writing as a way of working out what you want to say (pp. 22–4). * Show your reader clearly the structure of your essay or dissertation (pp. 13, 17). * Indicate clearly which aspects of your work are original and which are borrowed from already published material (pp. 20–1). See also pp. 25–8 for a checklist for getting started. Exercises (1) Select a novel you have just read. Using our description above (pp. 11–12), construct a brief summary of the main points which would make up an instance of each of the following TYPES of argument about the book: — stylistic mode (b)— contextual mode (d)— evaluation of conflicting critical arguments mode (f) Compare your three summaries. (2) Select any one of the exam questions we have presented in this chapter. Make a series of paragraph or section headings that you could use in a one-hour exam answer. (You do not need to know much about the topic to do this; you only need to be able to identify what you would need to know.) Bear in mind not only the length but also the proportion of your answer, so that each relevant issue in the question is addressed. (3) Invent a title in two parts (as in section 1.6), making sure that it indicates your attitude to the subject matter. Describe (in a short paragraph) the contents of an essay based around this title and briefly explain how the title captures the key idea(s) of the essay. (4) Invent a research topic (relate it to one of the subjects you are studying, if you wish), and write a list of specific questions you could ask about it, grouped as in section 1.10."
ACA ACA-HXH-002 4.02 "Gathering your materials together As we suggested at the end of Chapter 1, when you write you use — inevitably — what other people have written. For example, in writing an essay on some aspect of Emily Dickinson's poetry, you might use, possibly in order of likelihood: (a) some poems by Emily Dickinson, which you analyse;(b) a bibliography (list of books and articles), to find out what has been written by and on this poet;(c) one or more critical articles on Emily Dickinson;(d) a biography of the writer;(e) a dictionary of symbolism, to look up some of the symbols she uses;(f) a concordance to the works of Emily Dickinson (this is a list of all the words she used, and where she used them). Each of these sources provides new information that will enrich the ideas you start out with; and the materials you explore will also provide a springboard into completely new ideas, that you are unlikely to have simply by contemplating the poems themselves. This chapter describes some of the sources you might need to look at as you go about your study, how to find them, and how to use them. 2.1 HOW TO CHOOSE A LITERARY TEXT TO WORK ON We can begin by returning to the question of defining your essay topic. You choose an author; but then you need to decide which text or texts to  work on (sometimes which parts of that text or texts), and which version of the texts to choose. If you want to talk about the work of an author, you need to judge how many texts to talk about and how varied your selection needs to be (many authors write in different modes: novels, short stories, poems, diaries and letters, etc). Other choices include: should you pick well-known texts or little-known texts? Should you choose texts which are central to established literary traditions (canonised texts) or texts by marginalised writers? The important element here is the sense of choice and decision: the materials you choose actively shape the essay you produce. They are not simply background materials for your preparation, but guide what sort of essay will result. In some cases choice is governed by teachers or by the exam paper. In other cases it is shaped by personal preference (e.g. you already feel that you have something specific to say on a particular work). In other cases again, your selection is based on an informal research procedure: you choose works you consider representative in some respect (e.g. genre, length, typicality of theme); or well-known works (which you think need fresh attention); or little-known or neglected, ""minor"" works (which need discovery or rehabilitation). At this stage the most important consideration is that your choice is consistent with the overall purpose of the essay topic you are proposing. Once you have chosen your texts (or had them chosen for you), you need to decide how to focus on them. No matter how familiar with literary works you become, you cannot focus equally on all parts of a text (particularly a long text, such as a novel): so you need to decide which parts of it are most worth reading closely and writing about. This varies from novel to novel; but as a general guideline it is usually worth paying particular attention to the beginning and ending (where structural aspects of the novel are often signalled most clearly). With a poem, it is worth spending time thinking about why it has the title it has. Beginnings, endings and titles are sections of texts which usually repay particular study. Do you need to worry about which version of a text to use? One context in which it makes a difference is when you refer to a text by page or line number; different versions are often different in this respect, so the least you should do is tell your reader which edition you are referring to (which publisher, editor, etc.). You might also try to use an edition which your reader can independently get hold of, so that she or he can check what you say. The other reason for worrying about which version you should use relates to AUTHENTICITY. Some versions of a text convey better than others what the author originally wrote. Even the first printed edition of a text may have been altered by an editor, printer or typesetter. For example, in its first printed version Shakespeare's Henry V has a line  ""and a table of green fields"" , which modern editors now think should probably have been ""and he babbled of green fields"" . Bowdler's 1818 edition of Shakespeare cut out parts ""unsuitable for ladies"" . Amos Tutuola's (Nigerian) novel The Palm Wine Drinkard had its idiosyncratic English modified by its British publisher, Faber and Faber. Modern critical editions sometimes also make changes which go against authorial intentions; Keynes's Oxford edition of Blake's poems, for example, changes Blake's invented punctuation system to make it fit with standard rules of punctuation. Each of these versions has its own authenticity; and editorial decisions are interesting in their own right (and merit investigation) for what they tell us about the times when they were made (for example, the Tutuola revisions tell us about British attitudes during the 1960s to the English of non-native speakers). Usually, however, you will be concerned with getting as close as possible to what the author of the text (not a later editor or printer) wanted it to be. This means that you should be aware of different possible editions of the text. It is useful to distinguish between an original edition, a popular reprint, and a critical edition. The original edition is the text as it was first printed; most contemporary novels for example exist only in original editions. Older texts, however, may exist also in critical editions. A CRITICAL EDITION has a named editor, who tries to make the text the best possible version, and will usually include footnotes or appendices explaining decisions taken about words in the text. Critical editions are often more reliable versions of the text than original editions, since they will correct accidental errors or random editorial decisions in the original editions. Older texts are also reprinted in POPULAR EDITIONS (popular = for ordinary people, generally for non-academic purposes, though in practice often the editions used on courses). A popular edition is a version of a text intended for the general rather than the academic reader. You can tell whether a text you have is a critical or a popular edition by looking at the following features:— Does it have a note on the text, explaining spelling conventions used, etc.?— Does it have an introduction by an editor?— Does it have footnotes or endnotes?— Is it a numbered part of a multi-volume edition? If the answer to these questions is ""yes"" , you have a critical edition. Sometimes a popular edition will be based on a critical edition, making it appropriate for most uses. But you should avoid illustrated ""coffee table"" versions or simplified rewritten editions of a text intended for EFL students or children. You are unlikely always to have access to an authoritative edition. The next best thing is to show that you are aware of the issues that surround a choice of text (some of these will probably be explained in the introductory ""Note on the Text"" ). If you read with such issues in mind — and how they actively affect what sense you can make of a text — introductory notes often become relevant and interesting in unexpected ways. 2.2 HOW TO CHOOSE CRITICAL ANALYSES TO WORK WITH Much of what you will need for your study will be in the literary texts you have chosen — especially if you are reading annotated critical editions. But you will probably also want to consult critical analyses of those works, for a range of possible reasons. Perhaps the major problem in choosing critical texts to read and refer to is whether or not to use specialised student textbooks. There is a distinction in principle between a book which sets out original ideas, and justifies them (a MONOGRAPH), and a book whose primary function is to distil and tell you what other people's ideas are (a TEXTBOOK). Textbooks may of course also include original ideas, so the distinction becomes blurred (especially where a textbook doesn't tell you where it is offering contentious interpretations). But developing entirely new arguments is not usually a textbook's main function. A formulation of an original idea (e.g. in a monograph) is a PRIMARY SOURCE of that idea; its repetition or paraphrase in a textbook (or in another monograph) is a SECONDARY SOURCE of it. One advantage of secondary sources is that they are often easy to understand; but a problem which can arise is that they may have altered or distorted the original idea. For this reason, it is better to refer at some stage to the primary source of an idea, even if you came across it first in a secondary source. Textbooks are useful (particularly for telling you which primary sources to look for), but you should not have to refer to them very often in writing your final essay or dissertation. Quoting extensively from a textbook in a PhD thesis, for example(especially if you treat it as an authority rather than as something for critical comment) is likely to give the wrong impression: that you are a beginner rather than an expert in your subject. Think about what you are looking for when you consult a textbook. Are you seeking:(a) background factual information?(b) other people's interpretations of what you are reading?(c) accepted areas for debate (to narrow down what you think you should say, because of what other people have chosen to talk about)? Your use of information sources needs to be guided by a sense of purpose in your search, as well as by the interest and pleasure of browsing. In the next section we consider some sources of information, as we explore why and how sources can be useful in your work. Our purpose is not to define a basic library for you, but rather to suggest kinds of books which you might look for; and our choice of texts is based primarily on their convenience as illustrations. 2.3 BOOKS WHICH LIST FACTS (DICTIONARIES, ETC.), AND HOW TO USE THEM IN YOUR RESEARCH In most literary essays your central concern will be to say something about a text; and most of what you need will be there, in the text itself. Since the text provides you with so much material, it may not be obvious why dictionaries, encyclopedias and other books in the reference section of your library can be useful to you. In this section we explain why they can, and list some of the information sources you might want to use. In all cases, remember that the information you find is interesting or valuable only to the extent that you can put it to relevant use in your essay; facts do not come with fixed, off-the-peg significance. The most obvious example of an information source is a dictionary, which tells you what words mean. Remember that what you think a word means is not necessarily what it meant for the writer. It may have had a different meaning in a different place (e.g. ""cot"" means a child's bed in British English, but also a bed for adults in Indian English), or at a different time (e.g. ""gentle"" used to carry the meaning of ""upper class"" , as in ""gentry"" , but which now can be used as an approving description — something like ""sensitive"" — of anyone's character). Because words change in meaning, it can be particularly useful to use a historical dictionary such as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED existing as a multi-volume set, or photographically reduced, or on CD-rom). The full version of this dictionary lists all the meanings a word has had, with quotations to illustrate them. Other dictionaries contain lists of words which have special meanings in literary criticism, such as The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics or A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms. If you are writing about a twentieth-century author and you want ideas about the author or what to say about her or him, you can use the massive reference work published by Gale, Contemporary Authors (which lists biographical and bibliographical information, together with other relevant comments) and Contemporary Literary Criticism, which is described as ""excerpts from criticism of the works of today's novelists, poets, playwrights and other creative writers"" . Some authors will be less well-documented in traditional information sources such as these, for example pre-twentieth-century women authors; and here you may find it useful to use the Dictionary of British Women Writers. On the other hand, better known authors may have specialised sources of information associated with them, such as A D.H. Lawrence Handbook. And some authors have concordances devoted to them. A CONCORDANCE, as we have said, is a list of all the words used by a particular author, with an indication of where those words are used. You can use it to find a particular place in a text if you know a word used there, or as a way of following up a particular theme, metaphor or symbol. For example, if you look up the word ""wit"" in a Concordance to Congreve, you will find all the places where the seventeenth-century dramatist Congreve used that word; you can then work out what its particular meaning for Congreve must have been by studying how he uses it. Sometimes you have access to a text, but not to all the information you would like about it. You may have seen a film, but wish to talk about who did the cinematography or who played a particular character. Once the film credits are over, you have no permanent record. In this case you might use a popular reference work like Halliwell's Film Guide, or a journal like The Monthly Film Bulletin or Sight and Sound. There are also more specialised information sources you might need to use: if you want to know about the readership of a particular contemporary magazine or newspaper, for example(perhaps as part of a study of the relation between ideology and audience) you could use BRAD ( ""British Rate and Data"" ), which lists advertising rates and audited newspaper and magazine circulations. Sometimes historical information is useful. If you are working on a twentieth-century subject, you may find it helpful to use the enormous amount of information available about events in the twentieth century, organised by year. If you are writing about Eliot's poem The Waste Land (published in 1922) for example, you might consider it relevant to know about other events of that year (or the years when it was being written), and so you could look up 1922 in the index to the London newspaper The Times (the poem is set partly in London and was published there). In these indexes you will find information about countries, types of event  (e.g. crimes), about the arts (e.g. reviews) and about the subjects and terms of reference of contemporaneous public debate. As well as indexes for many newspapers, there are compendia such as Keesings Contemporary Archives ( ""factual reports on current affairs throughout the world, based on information abstracted from press, broadcasting, official and other sources"" , published from 1931 onwards). Sometimes a novel or poem gains some of its meaning by quoting or referring to another text. In these cases, writers may expect their readers instantly to recognise such ALLUSIONS. But there are changes in what readers know automatically, even leaving aside questions of education, social background, gender, ethnicity or age. A person in 1990 will have a different store of knowledge from a person in 1890, and even more different from a person in 1790. So information sources can stand in for what we do not automatically know. If you suspect a text is quoting another text, you can check by looking up what you take to be the key word of the quotation in a Dictionary of Quotations. If you think an allusion is being made to a Greek or Roman myth, you can try Lemprièe's Classical Dictionary or some other dictionary of Classical mythology. If you think a reference is being made to the Bible, you can use a concordance to the Bible. In many cases some of the work has been done for you by previous scholars; so, for example there is a book called Allusions in Ulysses (which lists allusions made in James Joyce's novel Ulysses). Finally, there are books which have information about many different kinds of topic, and which can often turn out to be useful in unpredictable ways. These include The Oxford Companion to Literature, where you will find information about authors, texts, literary movements, and general historical facts. The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature enables you to explore literary history by comparing juxtaposed commentary, quotation and pictures. The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language is a compendium of useful information about language, including language in literature. The original (but still available) Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable is an example of a nineteenth-century collection of somewhat idiosyncratically chosen historical, mythical and literary information; it is useful partly because of its eccentricity, in that it contains information you may not find elsewhere. And it would be wrong to overlook the very large general encyclopedias, such as The Encyclopedia Britannica. If, for example, you want to know about punctuation in the seventeenth century, marriage laws in nineteenth-century Canada, the history of the Elizabethan stage, or current theories of myth or symbol, this is one place well worth looking. Ignore the scepticism of those obsessed with ""definitive"" sources: the entries in Britannica are always good, and surprisingly detailed. 2.4 FINDING MORE TO READ Besides these almost standard reference sources, you will need to find more specific — and more specialised — ideas about what to read. One way of acquiring such ideas, of course, is to look on the shelves of a library (or bookshop), or in a publisher's or library catalogue, where you will find books gathered by subject and by author. Make yourself open to chance — often you will find things by accident while looking for something else, or when just browsing aimlessly. You may also like to look in anthologies. For example, the Oxford Book of Death will give you short texts relating to death, and selections from longer texts you might want to read all the way through if you are interested in the topic. If your library has a computerised catalogue, you may be able to get a list of all the books held on a particular subject matter. You can do this directly, if the catalogue has subject divisions, or indirectly by looking for all books with a particular word in the title. You could look for all books in the subject area ""feminism"" , for example, or all books with ""feminism"" or ""feminist"" in the title. BOOLEAN SEARCH techniques may be available in a computerised catalogue; these enable you to select all the entries which have, for instance, both ""feminism"" and ""Romanticism"" in the title (or close variants on these words). Another approach to finding more to read is to consult a bibliography, a list of books. One place to find such a list is at the back of a monograph or textbook. For most short coursework essays, this may well be enough. But you can also use specialised bibliographies. Many authors have whole bibliographies devoted to them, and there are bibliographies for particular subject areas (for example, Black British Literature. An Annotated Bibliography). The most comprehensive bibliography for literary studies is the Modern Language Association of America [MLA]international bibliography. Another, more selective and critical bibliography is The Year's Work in Modern Language Studies. (Notice that ""Modern Language"" in titles usually means literature as well as language, and looking in bibliographies for ideas about what to read is called a LITERATURE SEARCH — ""literature"" in this sense means ""the collection of what has been written"" .) A third approach is to look at ABSTRACTS. An abstract is a short summary of content. For example, a yearly volume called Abstracts of English Studies gives very short summaries of a large number of articles published in a year; there are indexes to help you find particular topics. Dissertation Abstracts International is another collection of abstracts, this time quite long abstracts of PhD dissertations. If you are writing an MA, MPhil, MLitt or PhD dissertation, you should look at this book to see what other people have written about the topic you are working on. You  can use abstracts as an indication of something you might want to read, or you can just read and learn from the abstracts themselves. Another way of finding useful or appropriate things to read is to look at library catalogues which have been published as books. In college and university libraries you will often find catalogues for other collections. These are particularly useful when the collections are subject-specific. For example, there is a published catalogue of the books in the Florida State University ""Shaw Childhood in Poetry collection"" ; this catalogue lists books of poems relating to childhood, together with lists of poems in the books, and even representative poems from the books — making it a bit like a dictionary of quotations on the topic. If your current interest happens to be in childhood in literature, this catalogue is an interesting place to browse. Once you start looking, you will probably find more than you have time to read. So you will need to be selective in what you decide to consult. Here are some ways of being selective. * Choose recent books first (they might tell you what earlier books have said). Check book dates generally, and ask yourself whether a source may actually be giving you an outdated perspective. * Look at the range of titles in the field and for topics which keep coming up. Make sure you read at least one book on each relevant topic. * If you have a book or article in your hands, check the contents page and preface or introduction: these will give you a sketch of the book's scope and argument. It is also useful to look at the bibliography or index to see what it includes and what it misses out. (Do the included terms correspond with what is in your view important, or the sense of what is important you have formed from what you have already read?) * Read the last page of the book or article: with any luck it will summarise what went before, so you can choose whether to read the whole volume. * Check the contents page and try to link up the entries into a developing narrative or argument. When you have used a bibliography to find the title of something to read, how do you then get your hands on it? If it is not in your library you may have to use inter-library loan, if this service is available to you. (In Britain all books published are kept in copyright libraries such as the British Library in London, and can in principle be borrowed by your library, though in practice they are not available to everyone.) In some cases, however, the elusive book which you need may in fact be hidden  in your own library. (A group of students who were asked to read the poem ""Lycidas"" by John Milton couldn't find it because it was ""not in the catalogue"" . What they needed to do was to look in Milton's Collected Poems or in an anthology such as The Oxford Book of Seventeenth-Century Verse, rather than expecting individual titles all to be listed separately in the catalogue.) Finally, anthologies exist for all kinds of text, so sometimes what you need can be found there. This is true even of critical essays: there are anthologies such as those in the Macmillan Casebook series or the Longman Critical Readers. 2.5 HOW TO READ A BOOK OR ARTICLE Finding your book or article is only the beginning, of course. Once you have it in your hands, there are a number of different ways of using it. Because you will often have more to read than you have time for, you need to develop ways of reading more quickly and efficiently. The techniques of scanning and skimming can both be used to gain a rough idea of what an article or book contains, so that you can read parts in more detail if you want to. You can SCAN, which involves just looking quickly at each page, to pick out anything which you recognise as being relevant to you, and which you can then read in detail (scanning involves looking for keywords). Or you can SKIM, which involves just reading the first sentence of every paragraph and anything prominent or highlighted (in this case, it is the general sense and flow of the book you are trying to absorb). Both of these reading techniques are examples of how reading is a selective activity. Even when you READ INTENSIVELY (that is, you focus on every word) you are still inevitably selective in what you understand or absorb. If you read an article or book twice you will probably be surprised by the many new things you discover the second time. It is a common experience in reading that you read something, then try to write about it; writing about it gives you new ideas, and so when you read the original again you find new things in it because of the new ideas you have brought to it. This suggests that books or articles which are important to your project should be read more than once (early on, and then again later in your study). Reading is an active process, one where what you bring to your reading affects what you get out of it: the more you know, the more you can understand. Don't go to books passively, expecting simply to absorb and to be informed. Constantly ask yourself what key questions reading this book is going to help to answer. As you read  through a book or long article, pause after each chapter or section and look back at any notes you have taken. Do they make sense? Do they provide facts or views you can use? Are there particular points you need to go back to, or will need to find out more about? 2.6 HOW TO KEEP NOTES Your reading will be useful only if you remember it and can do something with it. There are various ways of storing the results of your reading. You can buy the book, and write notes directly on it, or underline (or highlight) parts. You can photocopy relevant sections of the book or article. Alternatively, you can copy out parts of the book into your notes. Or you can try to restate passages of the book in your own words. Which of these you should do involves the basic decision whether you should copy the original words, or restate the content in your own words. The problem with keeping the original (e.g. as a photocopy, with sections highlighted) is that you haven't really done anything with it yet: you haven't assimilated it or made it your own, in the sense of fitting it with (and so allowing it to affect) your existing thoughts and knowledge. At some point, you will probably have to write out your own version of other people's ideas in the form of paraphrase or summary embedded in your own work; so it could be argued that you should do the rewriting from the outset, as you take your notes, in an effort to get at the ideas behind the words rather than just repeating the words themselves. The problem with this is that in doing so you are taking a risk: perhaps you are misunderstanding what you read, and so your notes become an incorrect version of what was said. One response to this objection, though, is that sooner or later you have to decide what someone means and how it is relevant to you; so you might as well take that decision consciously, while you have the book or article in front of you to check. However you make them, your notes are a record of what you have read. They may also be a record of your developing ideas. But you need to make sure you can find things again when you need them. This is one reason why cards (INDEX CARDS) are popular as a format for keeping notes. Index cards are easily handled and shuffled; they can be kept in alphabetised boxes, come in different colours, and can have a topic, keyword or reference written at the top, as an indication of what is on the card. These features make index cards easy to organise, and well-organised notes mean that you can find information more easily. One basic decision  you have to make is whether to index a card by writing at the top of the card a theme/keyword or a name of an author/title. You might for example have a card on the theme/keyword ""the sublime"" , including notes drawn from a number of different books. Or a card which contains only notes from Monk's book The Sublime: a Study of Critical Theories in Eighteenth-Century England. In general, the former method of organising by themes and keywords involves you more in doing analysis and thinking at the moment of reading, which is generally a good idea. You may also be able to store your notes on the equivalent of index cards on a computer (in a database, or in word-processing document files). Finding information in computerised notes is in principle much more efficient because you can search for every use of a particular word throughout your notes. On the other hand, on a computer screen you can only see a small amount of information at any given time, whereas with index cards you can lay them out across a table or on the floor for an overview. You also have to be able to have the computer with you when you take the notes, which is not always easy to arrange. In whatever format you keep them, the notes you make need to be clear; if they are not self-explanatory at the time you write them, they are unlikely to be intelligible later, when your memory of working on the particular book or topic has faded. So read over your notes once you have made them, and edit them until they are as comprehensible as possible without reference back to the source work. It is also generally a good idea to keep your notes short; while you may want to keep a record of everything that might prove useful, your notes will seem unhelpful if you feel swamped with redundant information when you come to refer to them later. 2.7 KEEPING A RECORD OF WHERE YOU FOUND SOMETHING At the beginning of this chapter, we suggested that when you write you use what other people have written. One of the conventions of research — which we discuss in more detail below, in Chapter 5 — is that you must enable your reader to find again what you have read (and in any case, it is useful for you to be able to find again what you have read). So you need to write down enough details of a book or article, or any other source, to enable it to be found again. In some cases it can be difficult or even impossible to find texts again (for example if the text is a lecture, or a television programme), but you should still keep details of them as fully as  possible, so that your reader knows exactly where ideas or words come from. The information you need to keep for everything you read includes the following. (You will find such information usually at the beginning of a book — though some books have details of publication on the last page instead.) (a) The author's full name. Write the family name first, as this will decide where the work will go in an alphabetical list. (b) Any other people involved, other than an author. There might for example be an editor, compiler or translator. (c) The full title — and subtitle — of the work. Put a colon between the title and the subtitle, even if there isn't one in the original. Underline the title of a book, and put an article's title in single quotation marks. (d) The name of the publisher, the place where it was published, and the date of publication — all for the edition you have in your hands. Often books will have a list of different places; the convention is to choose only the first. In some cases you may want to add further information: books are published in Cambridge England and Cambridge USA, so saying just ""Cambridge"" may not be helpful; add country details if you think there is a possibility of confusion. (e) If the text is an article in a journal or a chapter in an edited book or anthology, keep details about the collection in which you found it; for a journal article, note the volume and issue number, and the page numbers on which the article appears. (f) Sometimes books or articles exist in several different versions. If you are not using the original version, you should say so (e.g. by noting ""second edition"" or ""reprinted version"" or ""facsimile"" ). You should keep details of the original version, if you can find them. For an article in an anthology, for instance, you need to keep details of the journal in which it originally appeared. For a FACSIMILE edition (a photographic reprint of an old book), note both information relating to the current edition and also information relating to the original edition. If a book is a translation, keep information about the original title, publisher, etc. (g) Usually you will refer to or quote from a particular passage in a book or article; in this case, note the page number. Because literary texts exist in different editions it can be more helpful instead to note the chapter number, act and scene number, line number, etc. (and of course, you should indicate the exact edition you are using). (h) For your own benefit, also keep a record of where you found the book (which library and the call number), in case you need to consult it again. There are detailed guidelines, for example in The MLA Style Manual or the MHRA Style Book, to tell you how to deal with all kinds of complicated cases. Below, in Chapters 5 and 7, we enlarge on what we have said here, as we make suggestions about how to present references in footnotes and booklists appended to your essay or dissertation. But note in the meantime that published rules don't always help you. Often you need to work things out for yourself. Here is an example of the need to improvise. We wish to refer to an anthology of poetry and prose which we have open in front of us. At the beginning of the book, on the verso (left-hand) page, it says Oxford University Press. London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, New York, Toronto, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay Humphrey Milford, Publisher to the University On the recto (right-hand) page it says: A Book of the Sea. Selected and arranged by Lady Sybil Scott Oxford. At the Clarendon Press. 1918 The first problem is: how to record the name of the author. Should it be ""Scott, Lady Sybil"" or just ""Scott, Sybil"" ? We would be inclined to use the first, because it gives a better sense of the feel of the anthology; but this is a fairly arbitrary decision, where rule-books do not help. How should we list the author's role? We could say simply ""(edited)"" but perhaps we should take the title page at its word and say instead ""(selection and arrangement)"" . Is the publisher Oxford University Press or Humphrey Milford or Clarendon Press? (Actually, it is Oxford University Press, but we can be sure of this only because we already know something about this publisher.) Finally, is the place of publication London (the first in the list under the publisher's name) or Oxford? Again, we choose Oxford, but only because this is usually given as the place of publication for Oxford University Press books. So our notes say: Scott, Lady Sybil (selection and arrangement), A Book of the Sea (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1918). Getting to this stage involves some active interpretation (and some fairly random decisions too). As usual in writing, following rules by itself achieves little. 2.8 USING A COMPUTER TO FIND AND STORE INFORMATION Computers are particularly good for finding, storing and retrieving information. This can be illustrated in the context of literary studies with one or two examples, starting with the advantage of using a computerised library catalogue. A non-computerised library catalogue is likely to be a collection of cards, each a record about a book, in alphabetical order according to the author's family name. If you know just the title but not the author's name, you may be out of luck. In a computerised catalogue, on the other hand, you can in principle search according to any aspect of a record about a book. This is because computerised information is not as rigidly organised in advance, which means that you can search through it in any way you please. Computerised library catalogues are just one example of the many forms of computerised bibliographical information which are available. The Modern Language Association Bibliography from 1985 to the present is available on compact disc, so you can do much quicker searches than if you had to haul out each year's book one by one. Increasingly, literary texts are becoming available in computerised form. For example, the Oxford Text Archive is a collection of computerised texts, each of which you can buy on floppy disc for the price of a printed copy. Shakespeare's works are available on disc from many sources, as is the Bible. Compact discs are available which contain a corpus of a whole century of poetry on a single disc. And it is possible to make new electronic texts by scanning printed texts into a computer. The advantage of having a text in computerised form is that you can find things in it very easily using computerised search techniques, and you can do more complicated searches than you ever could with a printed concordance. Let's say you are interested in the opposition of love and hate in Shakespeare's play All's Well that Ends Well. Using a Complete Shakespeare on CD, you can look for all cases where these two words are used within, say, five lines of each other; and you'll get your answer within a minute or so. Another useful resource is offered by the possibility of putting very large dictionaries onto a single compact disc. The full Oxford English Dictionary is available on compact disc; and with it you can do far more extensive searches for information than the printed book allows. For example, if you are interested in the word ""love"" , with the book version of the OED you can look up ""love"" and you will be given definitions and illustrative quotations. In the compact-disc OED, on the other hand, you can look for the word ""love"" not just in the entry for ""love"" but in every  entry in the whole dictionary; the search will find ""love"" in any quotation anywhere in the entire dictionary. A search of this size is impossible with the printed OED, where you are restricted to just those quotations including ""love"" which the original editors decided to put into the entry for ""love"" . It is likely that computerized storage and retrieval facilities will take on an increasing importance in literary studies; so it is worth exploring them whenever you can. It should be said, nevertheless, that powerful search techniques, across such large databases, will still only contribute effectively to your essay-writing or research if you maintain a clear sense of what you are looking for and why — a guiding principle which is itself independent of the technology. 2.9 USING YOUR SUPERVISOR The role of a supervisor varies, depending on the level of work you are doing and the conventions of supervision for the department you are in. The role will hardly ever be one of telling you what to do; instead, the supervisor reviews what you have done. This means that as a student who is being supervised it is you who have to be proactive rather than reactive. Being proactive means negotiating with your supervisor about what you expect from her or him, instead of just accepting the terms (often not actually made explicit) on which supervision is offered. Prepare questions and an informal agenda for each meeting, so that when it is over you can be certain that — alongside all other new questions which are raised — you have asked or raised all the issues you wanted to. Try to arrange for a written record of what has been agreed for the next meeting, so that you can work to an explicit plan. Take an active role in asking for appointments; most kinds of research benefit from discussion at least every month or so. Do not let the channel of communication with your supervisor close — even if you are behind and would rather not have to face the situation of explaining why. Staying in communication allows for discussion and possible help, whereas losing touch will categorise you only as someone who is failing to meet deadlines. Always bring something with you to a supervision: ideas which you have written down, an outline of an essay, a text you want to talk about, or a plan of action. Your supervisor's approach and enthusiasm are likely to vary according to how motivated and organised you are. You will get better help if you have outlines and ideas for the supervisor to react to; experiment with your ideas and see what reactions you get, rather than waiting to produce ideas that you are sure fit in with an established approach. See your supervisor as a facilitator or notional ""editor"" /adviser of your work, rather than as a teacher who will inform you, or as an authority. Ask for comments on drafts of work you have written, and discuss those comments, even if this means talking about apparently negative judgements on your work so far. Feedback provided by your tutor is supposed to be helpful and constructive ( ""formative feedback"" ), and you stand to gain most from having comments clarified — even deciphered — where necessary, and ensuring through discussion that you understand the general perspective from which criticisms or comments are made. It is also useful to carry out your own critical analysis of an essay you have completed. A week or more after writing, you are likely to have sufficient detachment to examine your work as a reader, rather than as its writer. Add a list of your own comments to your tutor's feedback, for future reference. 2.10 PLANNING YOUR TIME Be realistic about time in your planning. And suit yourself — everyone works differently, and your personal best working patterns may well be different from those other people might expect from you. The aim should be to develop your own potential, not to regulate your working habits to a conventional norm. Allow for unexpected breaks such as days when libraries are closed, delays while materials arrive through the post, days when you don't feel like working, etc. And create breaks deliberately. For example, you should allow for creating variation in your working patterns. Read for a while, then do some writing or some research browsing in a library; this can reduce the effect of strain or tiredness with long bouts of writing, something which is particularly important for health reasons if you work at a computer. Remember that finishing off (e.g. by adding footnotes or bibliographic references) always takes longer than you anticipate, so allow enough time for this. Be careful with deadlines: some are notional (and extensions are possible); others are fixed and absolute, with the result that non-completion on schedule can mean failure. Check the rules to find out which of these your deadline is. 2.11 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter we have shown how writing an essay depends on the manipulation of raw materials collected for the purpose, including editions of literary works, critical essays, information gathered from reference sources and advice sought from teachers or supervisors. The work of writing an essay is greatly reduced if your preparatory stages are carried out thoroughly. This involves deciding what it is you are looking for before you start general reading, and, equally important, assessing why you need to read particular works or sources you intend to consult. Keeping clear and concise notes of what you have read enables you to organise your essay without having to refer constantly back to the original sources. Your notes form a bridge between the works you are studying and the outline and early drafts of the essay you are trying to write. Specific suggestions * Decide which parts of a text to focus on particularly (e.g. beginning, ending, title, etc.)(see p. 32). * Make an informed choice about which version of a text to use; try to use a critical edition (see p. 33). * Beware of quoting from secondary sources, particularly from textbooks (p. 34). * Find out what information sources are available to you, and be imaginative in how you use them (see pp. 34–40). * Look for ideas on the shelves and in the catalogue of your library, in bibliographies, in anthologies and also in bookshops and publishers' catalogues (see p. 38). * Be open to chance discoveries (see p. 38). * Don't read everything in the same way (see pp. 39–41). * Take notes, but don't necessarily copy directly from the original when you do so (see pp. 41–2). * When you take notes, keep a full record of all sources (see pp. 42–4). * Use the flexibility of computerised texts and search techniques if you can (see pp. 45–6). * Take the initiative and negotiate with your supervisor for the most helpful arrangement (see pp. 46–7). * Vary your working patterns (see p. 47). Exercises (1) Choose one literary text which you might work on which is  representative, plus one which is well-known, plus one which is neglected (see 2.1). Explain why each text might be interesting to work on. (2) ""Kitchen-sink drama"" is a name used for a particular group of plays written in Britain in the late 1950s and 1960s. Look up ""kitchen-sink"" in the Oxford English Dictionary (second edition), and explain how the entry could help you put together an essay on kitchen-sink drama. (3) Pick a brief passage from a poem you believe to be famous. Underline what seem to you to be the main or key words in the passage, including all names and any words beginning with capital letters. Look these words up in the Oxford English Dictionary (complete version, not the compact or shorter version); in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable; in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Literature; in the Encyclopedia Brittanica; and in whichever other relevant reference sources are available to you. Now imagine you are an editor, annotating the passage for a student edition. As you add explanatory notes, offer all the help you would hope to find, as a reader, in an annotated edition if you yourself were studying this particular text for the first time. (4) Pick a work you have recently read or are in the process of reading. Look up, in all the reference works available to you, entries for: — the author — the title of the work — the main characters in the work — the places referred to — any dates referred to. Go through the list, asessing what contributions (if any) each new piece of information makes to your understanding of the work. (5) Make a sample set of ""notes"" on a critical work you have recently read to help with an essay task, laying out your notes in two columns. In the left column, put what you consider to be all the main points made in the book. In the right column, note down all the points which would be relevant to or useful in your essay in particular. Compare the two columns. (6) Draw up a contract which you think would represent the ideal division of responsibilities between yourself and your supervisor. Discuss it with your supervisor."

I could, I could really throw the dirt at them  by saying that I'll, you know, if there is a conspiracy  there's, a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget, who all of a sudden after ten years of  slagging off the town clerk, all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side, together with  Councillor . Why? The only person who's involved in both, allowing the town clerk to take these decisions, without any  interference at all  Mm. and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council, and of course,. Just not so. Yeah. All of a sudden this erm  worry about this budget heading, is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er  cleared up. It's Dave  . I'd fire him. Mm.

Mm. First opportunity, real opportunity he gets  he's  doing everything the town clerk wants him to do. Yeah. I just, I, I, honestly Barry, I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy . Mm. Well certainly some people want  some answers want to be given on this  budget, er me as well, I mean, he can't just suddenly say  Well  it's all been sorted out, don't worry about it. Well  I think it will be really stupid. But I shall say  Dave    And how long ? Well I park I'll put er I'll drop you off.

I just wonder what on earth they're, they're playing at with  ha, cha cha cha cha cha cha. You know, I just don't understand what they're playing but th you know  They  they can only be doing  damage to th to the election chances I mean  Well they  they can't be achieving anything else! I mean saying things like  a successor has already been identified. I mean  it's just stupid! Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it is. Yeah, but it gives the impression there's a split group innit? Well, you give the impression of a  a faction in the party, now  I could, I could serve this faction quite easily  to  Mike  who'd give me a lot of say  if I said, you know,th the  the plot thickens, you know, here's a town  Yeah. hall employee Yeah. always an opponent of the town clerk  also now  erm  trying to cause problems.

He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer, he isn't secretary, he's, he's nothing  as far the constituency's concerned. They, if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman, who's Terry? Yeah. I mean, this is them deliberately saying things to their friends  and deliberately stirring it. They, oh! Because, I mean, I know where it's coming from, some of it's coming from Stanley , who, who thinks  if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances. That's not Ruth's own view of it. Well it, and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people. Because I'm, you know, if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are, quite frankly I'm  you know, willing to make remarks myself. Although I don't want to do damaging things, but  I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were  you know. Yeah. Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party. So do you want me to call at the  's now? Yeah. There's, may as well. Well, don't know.

Perhaps, well if it's snowing it won't be quite the same. That's right. Conducive to tripping about! But if it's quite nice weather, it would be nice to invite somebody along  I expect.

So she might want to go home! she wants to tell us all about her wedding  Could you tell her we're going to watch Inspector Morse! for the third or fourth time! Will she have watched Inspector Morse? She won't of watched it, cos it's bound to be on a Wednesday night! Does she like Inspector Morse? I don't think she watches it normally. No, she probably doesn't like it. A bit spicy! I bet she would, she loves anything like that! Bit of a body! Mind you, it might be  too complicated!

And  even people who write about   If it was not Bradley Hall , it can't be Bradley Hall again, they're always going in there ! Well that's fine. It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire  you know? Mm. It's as you come off the  And how did  and  they get permission then? They somehow managed to persuade the owners, apparently it was  and it was  and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place  not even  erm historians who write about famous buildings, even they had been refused access! Where is it? Somewhere in Oxfordshire. Oh! They don't know where? Oh  . So this was about last week's episode? I think it was about last week's epi , but they seem to e imply that it was last week's episode that would Oh. do it. We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before Wednesday.

Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad, and she has heard from your dad  apparently on Friday  he went  to the  consultant Mm. and next week he's got his first  well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy. And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now. Mm. I don't know how long it's going to go on for, or what it is exactly but I thought  it would be a good idea to ring your dad up  and see. Mm. But at least things have moved, and at least they've gone round. So I'm pleased really, are you? Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it? After seeing him, because he thought that once  he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to  get the treatment started, but they must have got themselves over that. Yeah. Well I mean everyone . Yeah. I think . Gotta get moving. And presumably whatever it was the GP had give him  has had tha , upset that thrombosis again. I don't know whether to ring him tonight, oh it's too late tonight now. It's much too late. Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up? Well they love talking to them on the phone don't they? I know they do. We could can prime them up on what to say  and types of things to talk about  so they don't get  moaned down or something ! Bogged down ! So he's had to go in, what did you say? Three times a week? I don't know  she just said  Something like that a few times a week  and I think it sounded like three  cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything. Mm  a trial! Well  I hope not  I mean no he won't be able to drive  but presumably your mum can do that for, they've got hundreds of people there, he's always driving people everywhere  That's right. so I don't see why they can't drive him! I'm sure they will  Yes. cos they're very good aren't they? I mean look at that woman doing her  er   from the  from the church.

That's right  she has a sort of  massive dose every now and then. And that makes her feel  what? She's not in pain  is she? More sort of  dopey. I wouldn't care if they made me dazed   Yeah. ! Yeah. I dunno. Not gonna   Difficult to know. Oh yes, that was it! I wonder how bad it is, that feeling's like, we don't really know  how bad it is do we? No. Perhaps he will be able to say, you know?

Have a look and see what you think. And then we'll tell you why you can't do it. Have you got Tim asleep? Yeah, that's why he's in a pushchair. It's erm mother's day assembly next Thursday. Erm Friday, so we'll all be sitting in the hall. Alright? So do come. sorry. Oh. Bye Sarah. Okay, no I haven't done. This one. Mm? Mum, this one. What do you fancy, this one? Let's have a look. Oh I reckon you've had that one Chris. We haven't. Is it any use? right in the beginning? No. I don't think so. We haven't had this one. Oh Timothy might enjoy  that . Timothy might enjoy this one. Mm. Apparently Timothy will enjoy that one. You'll enjoy that one. That's more complicated. It's a hard one. You want this one? Alright. It's a bit naughty isn't it to have had such a good game and er We're having this one so that we can play with Tim. Twenty eight. Twenty eight. You'll be able to tell Timothy what to do. Ooh. Are you allowed to do that? Oh you're allowed to tell him what to do. Whether he does it or not is another issue isn't it. Yes. Right, what have we got in that bag there? Have you got everything you need? So we might see you on erm  Mm. Wednesday? Sounds like it. Right lady  Oh dear."
DEM DEM-KD8-007 4.5 "One of the jobs we are doing is to identify what schemes they're planning that they won't need to build. That's not possible. If you need a larger one that that  That's what it says. I've got a No but template. on a bridge bit   Why not? It's, it's  that's really linked to do we need to do the Caernarvon link if we're doing the bypass? Do they need to do the  they've proposed that they  to bypass erm  if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass. Well can they detrunk that bit? Well it doesn't say that. Well can they detrunk that bit? responsibility not  Yeah. theirs if they put the bypass in. So what came out of this, well it could be   So are they looking to build a bypass first? The gut reaction this morning is we could end up  with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link. Oh that's no good is it? Of course it is. Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link . four percent fee . Mind you it's, it's a smaller job. What's smaller? Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway  on the Richard  principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway. If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough. So they're serious  Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this   so they're seriously looking to  the trunk road network coming down  bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass? Or is that just  That wasn't er  Ray  's view. That was this other guy's view. Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes. But which,whi which other guy? This Ve Vernon whatever his name is. The  are proposing this. They won't want that. They wo they won't   But the  the guy that's looking after the  schemes   Yeah. guy. He's what? He's looking after the  schemes for the leisure office. Oh! Oh he wasn't from . Sorry I thought he was He was from the leisure office looking after the  . Right. Got it. That's what it's, he's interest  Right. Yes. Very good. Well Right. have a lovely meeting. Seminar I will yes. Er you're going on this thing at the end of the month? Meetings  yes. There'd appear to be  out of this office. There seems to be an awful lot of us going, yeah. I'll o I'll only be there Friday morning and Saturday. I won't be there Friday afternoon  since I'm taking my son to the dentist . I do wonder if it's really w er I mean  Okay. See you tomorrow. You won't. I'm in Chester all day tomorrow. Manchester all day Wednesday. L E C visit Thursday, Friday. Busy man. I'd better get me timesheet out of  It's signed. Oh it's signed. Oh that's alright. We don't want  bothering us do we? Er where were we? Mm? Where were we? We were drawing up plans. It looks as though we're gonna be doing some extra survey work. Mm. Ah that's what I was saying  what Yeah, now detail on roundabouts. right. How much staff did we use? Can, can you   The erm  the Ormskirk Oh, that's a pity. track of methodology but   push to get Steve   today. Well I left a message with his  saying  Were any of these four arm rou it's a five arm roundabout isn't it? Were any of these four arm roundabouts? Yes  We did that one didn't we? We need to do these   Yeah that was  roundabout. That was a six arm. And we did  that one. Yeah that was a That's five arms isn't it? five. What other ones did we do? That one there? Hello Charlie. We did, yeah, we did the  here. That was a five arm. Well these down here  about fifteen or sixteen  Oh yeah well th yeah  the motorways were four arm. How many staff do we need to do that then? The full turn in  count. Suppose, well  supposing we count ins and outs and the  Yeah. sample. Right. You need one  t to  where, where were, where we talking about now? St David. See you're gonna get some busier than others. Yes. If they were all as busy as each other you've gotta have one doing ins and one doing outs. But on quiet roads, one person can do ins and outs. I'll er I'll  Yeah just get something done and I'll be back  Okay. And we'll go through it. On the Queensferry bypass, on the interchange there it was five hours. It's only really a four and a half hour roundabout isn't it? Yes but one is out and Yeah. Yeah. So you can  obviously that's gonna just be one person. One person could do a two way on a quiet arm but the others are gonna need  one person to do ins, one person to do outs. And one person at each arm doing a sample. So you've got  nine  plus four  Did we do a sample all day? No, just in the peak hours they're sampling. Didn't we do them off peak as well? We should have done them off peak as well shouldn't we? I don't know. I mean Jan did those. I think it was just peak hours. Er   It's gonna take thirteen people isn't it? Yeah, I mean if it was peaks only I mean there's nothing to stop me doing it. Well I appreciate that. Or you use it, you put everybody on in the peaks Yeah. and then you, you  You use the cutback In the off, in the off peak they rotate the staff and  I'm not The thing is what you're assuming then is that the pattern in the peak hour  is typical for the day as a whole. That's not right is it? Mm  maybe not. Well you'll get a different pattern in the morning peak and the evening peak for a start won't you? Mhm. Mind you maybe you won't. Depends, what you're really concerned about is how does the proportion of traffic  split to left and right and  straight ahead isn't it? If that pattern basically stays the same  then you've got, the volume, the flow will go up and down. Mm right. But if we did a full turning count how would we do that? You can't do it can you? It's not realistic. You have to do  if you're doing that you have to have all the ins and outs plus a circulation flow. Yeah. And I've never done one like that. We've always  you know, found a way round it. What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating. I think what we would do  supposing we didn't, supposing we just had  heavy vehicles and light vehicles? That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it? Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had  three classes. Motorbikes, cars, light goods  H G V including two three and four axle and buses  for the, for the whole count, now for the samples  Rob didn't even want it classified. It was just a vehicle regardless  of what it was. Yeah. I suppose we could do a classified count  er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we? Yeah. Separate, on another day. Yeah. Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side. Erm  perhaps the thing to do is to look at  how it varied in nineteen eighty six. Did you get that report out? Yes you did. How it varied between the two sides. There's three thousand one hundred there. Mhm. That's two way. On a twelve hour day. So assu you're talking about, well supposing that 's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction  over twelve hours. So you're gonna want to interview  forty percent right? How many do you think you'll need? Do you think you'll need  if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team? A half. A four. We did have  we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out. I'm only thinking that  you've got somebody counting? Yeah. There's one person counting? Two. Two people counting. Yeah. One's on a break. Two. Sorry? Oh  what are you on about now? When th there's a half team? A half team. Right yeah. If there's  a half team one people, one person counting  one on a break and two interviewing. And they have a break every three hours. Can one person count and cope  with that sort of flow? No I'd want two people. Two people counting? Oh what are you on about now? On this  this quieter roa oh right. Er yeah one person would be alright. That's the same sort of flow as we had a Birkdale Cop. Mm. Isn't it? We only had half a team there. Right. Yep that's alright then. Well my feeling on the roundabout is that we need to do, count ins and outs  and do a sample. Okay. And erm  I think that's the thing to do. Yeah. See the, so say if we, like you just said, we need thirteen people Mm. but there's only gonna be two days. If we've got two roundabouts there's only gonna be two days when we need that thirteen people. So when we're  Two roundabouts? There's that other roundabout isn't there? You know where the horses were in the field? That was a four armed roundabout. Just down from  Yeah. the station house place where we parked   You'll find that erm  the flows there are very low. So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people  I reckon  doing that? I reckon  Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right. Treat it as a crossroads  perhaps. I reckon  si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem. I think you'll find the flow is a  a low  it wasn't busy when we were there was it? No I mean it may be, you know you  i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four  not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought. No. Okay I'll take four people   And erm we're going very round very slow. And the visibility was good and everything. So I'd have thought that erm  you could put four or six, four or six people on that. And actually if we just counted this  to through traffic wouldn't be too much   Hello  right."
DEM DEM-KD8-009 5.28 "must be a good microphone stand surely? Brilliant The purpose of the meeting is only to record conversations. Right. Let's see where we're going. Okay, just to put you in the picture where  No it's alright. Go on. Yes. I've had several telephone calls  well I've made them as well. The advert has gone in. I've done all enquiries about putting the advert in for the temps. Yes. It went to Liverpool on Friday  and they were gonna do their best  to get it done  and Do we know when it goes in the er I think  I told Liverpool that if it gets to  erm  Caernarvon to the  Caernarvon office by today it will appear in this week's issue. Do we know when that comes out? No, I couldn't get that off her. Off who? Well I asked the girl and the she, we sort of sidetracked and  when I come off the phone I realized that she hadn't said. I think it's  What I'm thinking of is that Thursday or something like that. Presumably after that we w or on that date we'll start to get phone calls? This is true. And we need to be prepared Yep. because obviously er  I mean if you're in Yeah. they can be rung through to you but p erm  will need to be warned that we may get a flood of phone calls Yeah. and what they're about. And also I think it might be as well to have a pro forma. Probably you've got one. Yeah, well no we haven't so we could probably do with doing  Oh  that and then, you know like if I get inundated I can let Jim do some. Well that's right. I mean really it, it's erm  er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other? Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean  it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox. Yeah. Maybe Jim and I could  And when they ring up  do that this avo  Yeah. When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your ? Now look this is meant to record this, this, this is meant to record life as it is lived, English as she is spoken. You're not meant to bite your tongue like that. Right. Yeah if we  You can swear in the privacy of your own home. It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of  not the tape actually  yes alright   No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number  And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through. Yeah that'd be a good idea  Write the name and address and phone number down and then  Yeah. it's there. Okay I'll buy that. Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back. Yeah. Even if it's to say erm Oh sorry! sorry we've got enough. Yeah okay. Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing. Right, so that's the temporary staff. Yep. So what we haven't made any progress on  beyond, on that side of things is erm  if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be. Yeah. Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er   I don't think it's big enough is it? Because of the size, no. Er just out of interest I did ring  the other day  Yeah right. Er  the  the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people Mm. which I mean even that may be too big for what we want. Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday. So already you're only talking  There was a thing about exams. Wasn't it  didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something? No. That must be something   Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday. Which room is that? That's  the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called. Cos there is a room called the navigation room. No that wasn't an  that wasn't an option. There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it  zoomed up to like a hundred. And even if we were to use this  Oh I know now, yes. small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a  come down at night, back up in the morning  What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time? Erm  no. Cos it may  I mean I've probably seen it Yeah. but I can't remember. Cos probably it will say what room it was. Yeah it was this small, I  It may well have been ano  think it was this  I thought it was the small  Oh it was that one was it? Well you're talking now  Anyway  Do you want me to get it? Er have you got it on your desk? Yes. Oh  right   How many days are we talking about anyway?coding  data. Couple of weeks I suppose. Right. No wait a minute, three sites  you're talking about a week and a half or something aren't we? Yeah. Fortnight at the most. Yeah. Cos you've got to allow for like they might not have done it before. Erm  but you're talking fifty eight pound a day Mm. for that small room which I think's a bit steep personally. Let me take a look. It's er  It's possible that you did get on the  the     It crossed my mind. There's The Oak's room. Can't   The Oak's room up to a hundred and twenty. Four pound per hour. Sixteen pound a day. And what are you saying it is now? Fifty eight pound a day. That's an awful lot more isn't it? Yeah. There's  I mean so many of them have caught on. Jan for example, when we had the  the town hall thing, that was five pound a day. Yeah. It's twenty five pound a day now. I think they've just all jumped on the bandwagon. They don't provide anything really do they? Well no, that's it. So as soon as she said that it was in use Monday Wednesday I sort of  If we went to   subconsciously ruled it out. village hall, church hall Yeah ? which is a church hall, they don't have a charge, you have to make a contribution. Where's this sorry? Well you, you need to, it's pretty grotty, it's a grim place Mm. but it's er it's the church  the parish hall  in . Whether they've got tables and stuff like that I'm not sure. Mm. If you ring Roger  Yeah and ask him. He  did investigate having a public enquiry there last year. And erm  so he will have a phone number of the vicar and so on. Mm okay. Okay. I mean in a w well  I can't, did we, I wonder if we recharge this to the Welsh Office or not? We probably do. Probably doesn't matter does it? No I would have thought The other thing might be to ring up  Borough Council  cos they've got offices in Caernarvon. Suppose that  that place  they might, there might be a er a parish hall there or something   That pub would be alright wouldn't it? Yeah. Okay, or  That would be twenty five pound a day as well, or fifty pound a day as well . Anyway it's a thought. I mean if we have to  er obviously what you're saying with  it's already in use and we can't have it? Yeah. It's not erm  it's no good just saying oh we can have three days out of the week anyway. No. You know, it's gotta be Monday to Friday or none at all hasn't it? Mm. Well if it was four days it would be alright but Mm. anyway  Okay so they're a few options to try as regards the coding  Alright and if we can't find anyway where we'll have to   out and come back here. Yeah. problem as well. I think we, we should find somewhere. Yeah. Really. Erm so that's a few options as regards the coding. Now  Right   The interviewing  and the briefing session I think we'll probably get away with in  Debbie  's  Yeah we're not going to, I mean we're only going to  we're, we're  Well it's not a sort of formal interview   we'll only be briefing the interview staff That's right. and accounts staff. Yeah. So we're only talking about half a dozen   Well  I think it's slightly more. Well eight or ten or something isn't it? Yeah. Thanks. Thanks . Yeah you're talking about a dozen people, something like that aren't you? I mean for that er Well if necessary we can bring them into here. Yeah. Half a dozen and half a dozen   Yeah. That's, I can't see that being a problem, that should be okay . Have you briefed  before? Yeah. Well Mike comes out. Mike shows his face doesn't he? Well he did for the Wigan one. I did it for the erm Ormskirk one  Yeah. That was okay wasn't it? We did that in two shifts didn't we? Two days. Yeah. Two mornings. We had a hell of a lot of staff though didn't we? That was a, we did that in the conference room downstairs. Mm. Erm right. What w w  And anyway  we now, we've, we've also got to progress on site layout and things haven't we? Yes. And get in  er  the cones and signs. Yeah I've had  er   we, we, you've got    we've got to wait till tomorrow haven't we? That's right, yeah. Yeah. Now as regards signs I've spoke to numerous, oh  school holidays I've got  erm   when the schools are off. Right. I spoke to the Education Department on Friday. Erm  as regards a caravan I spoke to this bloke  Frank  No he's gone bust. Well he hasn't gone bust but they don't hire them any more Oh right. but I did try him. Er no Gwyllam  at Gwyneth County Council Gwyllam   oh no I'm thinking of Peter . erm  he didn't think they had any bilingual signs and they didn't have  they weren't using their Portakabins so they scrapped them all last year  sold them off. Mm. But he did give me somebody to ring about caravans Mm. but then later on in the day he rung back and said he had found some  bilingual signs but all he's got were about four foot square  er with census point ahead. He hasn't got things like stop  census. Stop if required  or  slow census point which is the ones we use. It might be worth asking erm  Mel  Yeah. about that. You see for a start we need to decide to we need it. Do we need them Bilingual? bilingual? They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council. No. And the other thing er if they  they just haven't got anything like that. Yeah. They use sort of blank  Wasn't there a big fuss though because  there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side  the last survey we did? I don't think so was there? There's a letter in the file  Well that's   about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates. Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints. But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem. Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave  saying that every  you know, possible thing was done to  get bilingual staff but at the end of the day  you know they couldn't come up with the goods. I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now. They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers  the job centre only came up with about two people. So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation. I wonder if, I wonder if erm  you know if you rang up erm  the county council and said   you know   I mean er  y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family  Yeah. You know? It maybe Yeah. You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often  I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it. Yeah. It may be, you know? Yeah. See how the response goes with this and then Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth? Er Gwyllam . And where is he? Who, how did you get hold of him? Erm    You rang up, did you ring up Owen ? Er no. I spoke  I just rung up erm it was Highways and Transportation and  Mm. I asked to speak to somebody in the Highways  in the Transportation Mm. This was at Bangor and then I got another number  and then I got told that they now have the direct  organisation Right. so then I rung this person here and spoke to a Steven  Mm. who was the  head from the civi civil engineering division. Yeah. Steven  put me through to this Gwyllam  Right. who is  in the, the depot place. Right. And that's how I got on to him. Okay. So we've not spoken to anybody on the sort of like the traffic erm  counting side of things there? No. No. Okay. So this fella was, he come up, he found these signs and said, you know, didn't know if they would be, be any good. Erm but he'd given me this number, Glen  about Portakabins. Er he's at . And I rung this  Glen   er  wherever that is erm  and he does have these Portakabin things. Er several measurements Is that, that's a hire company is it? Yeah, they're like  they've got a big fleet of them. Erm  Right. But they're Portakabins? Yeah, rather than caravans. Yeah. Now I don't think they sound very   to suit our needs. Well you have to furnish them as well don't you? Well that's it. And there's all separate, two pound a table  from fifty pence to one pound fifty for a chair. There's no toilet in them  And you probably have to hire them by the week do you? Er minimum of four weeks. Yeah. And how do you move them around? Well they would move them round  this fella himself, but it's gonna be a hell of a lot of money to get them to do that. Mm that's what I would have thought. Plus there's no toilet. Exactly. But he has a separate toilet. Well that's all gonna be extra as well. Mm. And erm So how much you talking about? For a twelve foot one  Well you're talking  twenty two pounds? Yeah. So you're talking about eighty eight quid? Yeah. It would be cheaper to get David . Yeah well I've spoke to David . He's quite willing to take the caravan out there. Erm  and then you've got the toilet on there. You know what you're getting because we've had it before. So then I got back on to Gwyllam  and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you  someone there be willing to do the  from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem. Right. But he doesn't know any details. Okay. Er you know I mean just like we don't. We don't know dates or anything yet do we? No. So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr . I think that's probably the best. And just let these do the transporting because this  this fella honest to god he was doing me head in. Erm  saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it. Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times  trying to impress me. So let's stick to Mr . We know where we are with him. Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that. Right. Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it? Mm. Yeah. And we, we've got to wait for erm  Mel  to be in tomorrow. Haven't we? Yeah. And we're obviously going to ask him to  He, he to go ahead with it. looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after  the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme. Mm. They have a sort of programme of their own  on er doing counts on roads. I mean  a and most of it's done through the county councils. So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment. Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided  Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us. And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in. And the information's recorded on the cartridge. And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel  is Yeah. and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever. Ah. So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine  you know. But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside Yeah. obviously but I think you need  clearly in the first instance to use that  And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got   Well I, it's just a thought. I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether Yeah. just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some  origin destination surveys  interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it  that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere. Erm  and erm  you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones  census point and so on  Yeah. and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem. Yeah. Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them. Cos presumably, when you look at the layout  most of the signs are keep left signs. Yeah. Or you get the  you get ones that are sort of road narrows Yeah. and you get the, the warning ones. Yeah. And the warning ones have a little census  plate on. Erm  so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that. But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they? Yeah. So the only ones you really need  and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock. Yeah. So the only ones that probably need to get made  are census stop if required etcetera. So there's only three of those. Yeah slow census and  whatever. So presumably if, if  Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon  you know, the rest can sort of fit into place. Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and Yeah. Yeah like  you know and   you see yellow ones don't you? On the motorway and stuff Yeah. they have survey on. But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little  Yeah  plate on the bottom that says survey. yeah. Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that  I'd have thought it would be alright. Yeah. Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know? Yeah, I see what you mean. We might be able to get round it. I'll see what this fella says. Well I mean I was saying to  this bloke well  can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no  no can't think of anywhere. Well you could try Clwyd or something but   can't think everybody you know. Clwyd might well do some. I wonder Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring. He's at Cheshire. Oh yeah. Who do we know at Clwyd? Davydd . Who? Davydd . Never heard of him . He's Brian's brother is he? no. Okay so let's just go   He used to work for Liverpool City I think, and he was called Dave there. Er right, just going back to the actual  er roadside interview, is that one on the  the B road, or is it the A? That's the one. Er I was only going to propose to use four staff on that. Have a look at the, I think that's what we've done last time. Yeah. Okay. Have a look at the erm  we must have a count but  yes, have you got that report? Of the  Or have you given it back to me? Well no just the   oh, yes it might be on that but I  the early report   the reports on the erm  surveys which were done   Did you give it back? Yes I did. Right. Okay. Okay so then  Well they give us an idea of what the flow was then anyway won't it? Yes. And I think you're right. And the other thing  Oh oh we've put in a  making the interview forms, just having the  Welsh translation on the top. I was explaining to Jim how we could do that and it looked pretty straightforward so  or, or not. It's  Have we got the interview forms? That we used last time? Mm. Yeah but they're like four interviews on a sheet and really sort of  Yeah. But I mean who  what, how w , what are w , have we got our current ones, our standard ones? Yeah. Cos presumably it would be best to use those wouldn't it? Yeah. I think  you could, you could accommodate it if you just reduced that sli the, what the normal one slightly, and there's t there's room to put the er translation on the top. I'll do you a mock up of that and see what you Yes, good idea. what you think. I think either that or have it on a separate sheet. But I would have thought it's best to put it on there if we can. How many are we gonna want? Three thousand? Perhaps it's worth having a separate print run for that isn't it? Yeah, might be. It's not  I think if they use this offset thing, the masters last about five hundred so you're not  it's not, it's not a silly amount. Yeah. Would it take, oh wait a minute! Three thousand interviews What  say, would you think three thousand interviews? I'm just trying to think what we were averaging. But I mean that  one of them's not gonna  you're not gonna get as many  on that B road. Will we  will we want those? Oh I can't remember you know what we used for Ormskirk  It doesn't matter if we  if we get too many cos you can always use  Well that's it. Can't you? Yeah. Mm. If you see what I mean. Yeah. Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics  for them to do in Liverpool? Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you? No. And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get  Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it? you could get  nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether? Yeah. At two on a page is two thousand sheets  plus however many you'd only get one on. So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't  out of the way really. And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway. No. Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones. If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they? Yeah. Excuse me, by the time you run a  Cos we hold the original  to that. To the interview  Well we'll need some  anyway. Yeah. We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three  so it might be worthwhile  doing a  copy of it. Doctoring it Oh I see yeah. to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for  Oh right. Yes . We'll have a look  And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we? Good. I'll, I'll dig it out after. Yeah, right. Right, is there anything else? So, yeah there is. Erm  things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about? I haven't done anything about that. Right. Erm  erm statutory undertakers? Bus companies Yes we'll need to write to all those and  we'll need to write  we need to write to the police Yeah. on  in two guises don't we? Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn  partly because of the emergency services aspect. Yeah. So we need to write to the police to er  I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police  Yeah. which is I think in Colwyn Bay Yeah it is. and  but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm  traffic inspector at wherever it is. I'm not sure   Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay? What what   Just write to the Chief Constable. I think we need to write three letters. One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade  just saying  we're proposing to do them. Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites Yeah. and the dates are on. Yeah we'll do this  But that's normal. general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm  once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know  Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates. Oh okay. Oh I suppose we've gotta, oh well what did we do last time? I remember the problem was last time sending those little plans out, the Ormskirk you know? Give them the drawing number so we sent a transmittal note, course we never got a transmittal note back. It's best to avoid that. Yeah. Erm  right well I think the thing to do is, on  beyond that is to make sure we work through the checklist. Okay? Erm  Now layouts, site layouts. Yeah maps and things. So are you leaving the ball in my court on that? On what? On the statutory undertakers. Cos I can probably get some information out of here. I think i if you want  er I mean you're quite happy to draft a letter? Yeah. I mean that's a  I mean again  standard thing that goes to all of them   we need to write them, warn yeah, and we ask them to let us know what they've got planned don't we? Yeah. So you could send them a letter with a little diagram that  Yeah. I wonder how good that is, yes I think that's alright isn't it? Then they wouldn't  they'd understand what we, that meant wouldn't they? Yeah but that's got specific things on . True. Yeah well all we did for Ormskirk was, it was just an O S map and we just drew a bloody great circle round it and said this is the study area. That's probably the best thing isn't it? Yeah. And blow up  an O S and just  well within our sites and everything  But don't give it a drawing number. No. It's just attached to the letter. Yes. Now you get your, you've got your list of who you want to write to? Yeah. If you check with erm  Dennis   because they're doing all, you know, doing the contract documents, he could  confirm all the, the current addresses. Okay. That alright? Yeah. You're sounding a bit weary . No that's alright   There's no rush about this, I mean er you know, you've got well Well there is up to a point because you know how bad they are at responding. Yes there is. I mean er what I mean is it needs to be done this week sort of thing. Yes. Oh that's okay I'll get all them off  . I'll do a, I'll do a draft letter this afternoon, you can have a look at it, erm  we'll knock a plan up  and her get the addresses and then that's  it's easy then innit? Yeah. I wonder if we do want to put it in  Oh sshh  You've finished your mi meeting already Mike? Right, well let's, okay. Er, yes. Sorry about that. No it's alright we're only trying to work somewhere, somewhere quiet."

FIC FIC-AC2-003 4.59 "Mark could hardly believe his ears when, two days before the EPC meeting, Muldoon told him that Nate wanted him to fly out to Istanbul right away. It was true that a major problem had just cropped up which demanded immediate attention. The Corporation's major vehicle assembler in Turkey was in serious difficulties, due to the fact that the new Government had slapped an embargo on the importation of components to conserve its diminishing currency reserves. United Motors had received two urgent requests for assistance; one from the local Managing Director, who needed help to resolve his serious plant problems, and the other from the Turkish Prime Minister requesting UM investment support to reduce the country's massive trade imbalance. All this was fact. The fiction was that Nate had instructed Mueller to arrange to get Sanders down there quickly, when he had done no such thing. Muldoon spun the line that the deteriorating situation in Turkey was clearly more important right now than the EPC meeting. Events there were taking much the same course as they had in Portugal, and as Mark had resolved that problem in double quick time, he was considered the best man to deal with this new problem situation. All very flattering, but…. The Englishman sensed that the big personal build-up was a blind to hide Muldoon's real reason for wanting him out of the country. He knew full well that the only circumstances in which a regional planning manager would not be expected personally to present his Ten Year Business Plan to the President of the Corporation was if he was already earmarked for promotion and it was desired to give visibility to his successor, or if he was on his way out. Mark knew that he would never be promoted after the Steiner incident so he concluded he must indeed be on his way out, or being moved sideways. Sensing the  game which was being played, he decided to throw several balls in the air for Muldoon to catch, if he could. So he said that he would take the next available flight to Turkey immediately after the EPC meeting. No, that was no good. Istanbul was expecting him. Meetings had been set up. Nate wanted him there straight away; like today; tomorrow at the latest. ‘Well, give me a few minutes,’ Mark said, ‘and I'll ring the Prime Minister's office in Istanbul, to see if they'll agree to a short postponement.’ ‘No, you can't do that,’ Muldoon replied hurriedly. ‘It was Nate himself who had the meetings fixed up, and he wouldn't want them changed.’ ‘But nothing can be more important than the Business Plan,’ Mark insisted. ‘Nothing, but nothing, is ever allowed to take precedence over that meeting. Dammit, it's the future of the European components business I'll be talking about.’ ‘Yes, I know that, Mark,’ the American countered. ‘But Nate has specifically said that you are the man he wants to fly out to Turkey. I'll have to give the presentation on your behalf. After all, I am the Regional Manager.’ ‘But you never give the planning presentations. That s my bailiwick,’ countered the Englishman, with growing resentment in his voice and manner. ‘Yes, I know that, Mark, but….’ The American couldn't continue the charade any longer. Lowering his head, he said, ‘I'm sorry, Mark, but that's the way they want it, and that's the way it's got to be. Klepner can check out the slides for me. They are all done, aren't they, and the text?’ Mark nodded his head. ‘Yes, sure. Everything's finished.’ He only realised the finality of the phrase a second or so later. Muldoon didn't know quite what to say. ‘I know you have worked your arse off to produce the plan, Mark, and it's a great one. No doubt about that. But if Detroit has its reasons, it has its reasons. It's as simple as that. I'll hold the fort and fill you in when you get back.’ Mark turned towards the door. It was pointless to argue further. Muldoon was simply carrying out instructions. ‘Fill me in…that's just about it, Pat, nice choice of words.’ He opened the door and turned toward the American. Who are you going to hand the presentation over to, after you have given the introduction?’ he asked quietly. They both said the name together —‘Klepner.’ Mark was sick at heart as he drove home that evening. He had a blinding headache and simply wasn't thinking of what he was doing as he swung the car off the slip road to enter the motorway. His thoughts were fiercely occupied elsewhere. Without even glancing in the mirror, he crossed the inner and middle lanes into the fast lane and, in fewer than ten seconds the speedometer needle was registering one hundred and fifteen miles an hour, but Mark was oblivious of the fact. Suddenly conscious that he was flashing past vehicles which appeared to be dawdling, he glanced at the speedometer. He was doing one hundred and twenty! He jerked his foot off the accelerator and glanced in the mirror, heaving a sigh of relief that nobody was on his tail. Slowing to seventy, he made his way home. He very rarely spoke about business matters to Georgina and decided on reflection against recounting the day's events except to say that he was leaving for Istanbul in the morning, and would be away for three or four days. The Tri-star jet was two hours late on take-off from Heathrow, and then had to abort on the runway at lift-off point due to a sudden failure of one of the engines. The pilot slammed the powerful jets into reverse thrust, bringing the giant plane to a halt just before he ran out of runway. In a very matter-of-fact voice he apologised for the shut down, due to engine failure, adding laconically that he had left ten thousand pounds worth of tyres on the runway. ‘British Airways will not be at all pleased with me.’ he remarked casually. ‘There goes another Brownie point.’ By the time the plane approached Istanbul in the late afternoon, Mark had put away several large measures of single malt Scotch. Mechanically he had taken each drink offered without thinking, for the simple reason that he had spent the entire journey staring out of the cabin window into the infinity of space. His meeting was not until the next morning, so he could switch off for a few hours. He needed to do just that, for he was tired, morose and bitter and, for the first time in his life, feeling very insecure. Gazing out into the blue, he asked himself if this assignment was his swan song. Must be, he concluded. Nate would never have taken him off the presentation if he wasn't being moved sideways or demoted. But why? To make way for Klepner, Mueller's pet poodle? It had happened before, to make way for Muldoon. Why shouldn't it happen again? If you couldn't trust the bastards then, why should you trust them now? He closed his eyes. What made Nate and the executive committee think that guys like Klepner and Mueller knew more about the European components’ business than the Europeans? What the hell would the US component divisions say if the executive committee was stupid enough to appoint Europeans to manage components operations in the United States? No prizes for guessing the answer to that question. The blonde hostess leaned across him to re-charge his glass for the umpteenth time. His favourite Scotch, Glenlivet. Good old George and James Smith. Now there were two characters you could trust! So easy to relax and forget your troubles when you had a glass of their malt in your hand…. He jerked forward with a start to find the hostess fingering with his seat-belt clasp. ‘Just arriving at Istanbul sir. Please fasten your seat belt.’ Fred Clasper, the militant Merseyside convener, was a desperately worried man. Things weren't going at all well within the UK vehicle Division. Even his own notorious plant, which had consistently gone downhill for ten years under his active leadership, had been steadily increasing efficiency and output for several weeks without interruption. Morale on the shop floor was higher than it had been for a long year and an unhealthy atmosphere of optimism and hope pervaded the plant. Union members were openly expressing the view that there was a real chance that the ailing division would now pull out of its dive with the Peters' Plan, which had been fully supported by Bunker and a two-thirds majority at the plant. To Clasper's disgust, the majority had voted against his recommended call for strike action and he now sensed all too painfully that he was beginning to lose control of his members. Management was once again managing, something which he had never allowed to happen during his ten years as convener. Arising from Clem Bunker's endorsement of the plan, new methods had been introduced which were greatly increasing earnings through higher productivity. Restrictive practices, which Clasper had fought so hard to introduce, were being discarded at a rate of knots in the quest to increase efficiency, output and earnings. As a lifelong Communist, Clasper knew that it was absolutely essential to wrest control of the workers away from the plant management. He had exercised effective control of the labour force for ten years at the giant plant and had been able to bring the workers out on strike at the drop of a hat. It was he, Clasper, who dictated to management the size of the labour force they would require to produce a given number of products, regardless of any figure which management might arrive at by employing accurately measured work standards. If in effect, Clasper said that three men must be employed to do two men's work, then that was it. On those occasions when he had felt the need to demonstrate his power to management, he would create an instant departmental dispute which always had the immediate effect of lowering that day's efficiency to below fifty per cent. Since the plant manager was never able to make up a day's loss of output which pulled down his monthly overall efficiency figures on which he was judged, it was never difficult for  Clasper to prove his point. As he had always succeeded in getting his own way, the workers had been inclined to go along with him, even when their instincts told them that he was wrong. They really had no choice in the matter for he had always been able to threaten any dissenters, or strays, with the loss of their union cards. Successive personnel managers had always caved in to his demands as they knew full well that Clasper would win a stand-up fight. Yet an uneasy feeling had been steadily growing among the ten thousand workers employed at the plant that the benefits which Clasper's militancy had achieved were illusory. Increased earnings, grabbed as a result of strike action rather than earned by increased productivity and profitability had always been subsequently eaten away by inflation. The Corporation was also no longer expanding its British operations, in marked contrast to the frequent expansion of its plants in Germany, Belgium and France. Every long service worker employed at the plant and within the division knew that union restrictive practices had lowered productivity to below the levels achieved on the continent. These more loyal long service employees had an intuitive feeling that the division would ultimately go out of business in the UK if it continued to operate in the way it had behaved over the previous ten years. Even the notoriously militant workers at the Merseyside plant were now beginning to recognise that distinct possibility. It was generally recognised that Clasper was not the man to dismantle restrictive practices, nor to co-operate with management to make the necessary improvements in labour relations if they were to keep their jobs in future. The majority now believed that Bunker's more realistic approach made more sense. Clasper was beginning to be seen by his own members for what he really was: a born agitator and troublemaker who was great to have around when plant managements behaved like bastards because he was one too and would give as good as he got in a stand-up fight. But he certainly wasn't the man to have in the driving seat on the union side when both management and workers were striving for the sheer survival of the company, and needed to work together if they were to pull through. It was being said quite openly on the factory floor that the only place Clasper would lead them to was the end of the dole queue. The Communist convener could both feel and see that he was losing control. Fewer workers bothered to listen to him when he called meetings to protest against the Peters' Plan. He was also being subjected to cat-calls and ridicule. At one such meeting a heckler had got a great round of cheers from the assembled throng when he had told Clasper to get off his bloody soap-box and do a day's work for a bloody change. To his disgust he found that the workers would no longer respond to his call for mass meetings during working hours. They now told him, in no uncertain terms, that if he had something important to communicate, he could do it in the plant car park during the lunch break, or after working hours. They were not disposed to lose both output and earnings by downing tools. In desperation Clasper called a private meeting of the hard core left-wing stewards under his convenership, who could always be relied upon to fight against management and the capitalist system. The British people had just elected a Conservative Government, headed by Britain's first ever woman Prime Minister, who had already earned the reputation of being ‘the best man for the job’ in the Conservative Party. Within days of taking office, she had invited Don Peters to explain the problems which had bedevilled the British vehicle plants during the sixties and seventies and to outline his company's plan for the future. Living up to her reputation, Peters found that she had done her homework thoroughly. She was tough and uncompromising. She noted, she said with a pained expression, that output from the UK Vehicle Division of United Motors had been falling steadily over the previous ten years. At the same time, UM imports had been steadily rising, including very substantial imports from UM Vehicle Divisions on the Continent which had greatly expanded their total output and exports over the  same period. ‘United Motors used to make a very healthy contribution to Britain's export drive. Now you are the biggest single contributor to our balance of payments deficit,’ she said acidly. ‘Trends of this nature don't simply happen, do they?’ she asked with feigned innocence. ‘It has to be planned that way, does it not?’ She wanted to know what the UK Vehicle Division was doing to correct its appalling track record of recent years, particularly when compared with its Continental plants. She then ticked off several points she wished to make. Don Peters had been pleasantly surprised to find the Prime Minister's forthright manner lived up to her advance publicity. The United Kingdom had a serious balance of payments problem in manufactured goods, which was only partly disguised by the revenue beginning to flood in from North Sea oil, which had a limited life. The problem had been seriously aggravated by the poor performances of UK vehicle producers — his own company foremost among them — and the Prime Minister naturally wanted to know what he was doing to correct the adverse trend. It was a straightforward and most pertinent question. He would have posed the same question if he had been sitting in her position. For nearly half an hour, the American explained the plan which the Corporation had recently approved. He then answered the many penetrating questions put to him. In answer to one such question, he replied that he was pleased to say that he was now being given full support by the unions which drew the sharp retort…. ‘NOT BEFORE TIME!’ Before she dismissed him she said unequivocally that it was the Government's intention to rebuild Britain's weakened manufacturing base and reduce the ever-growing importation of manufactured products. ‘If industry doesn't help me to achieve the objectives of the Government, we will have to take appropriate alternative steps,’ she had said with a steely smile. ‘But I hope that won't be necessary. Thank you so much, Mr Peters for the chat. Most helpful. I will invite you to dinner when you correct your trade imbalance.’ Mark booked into The Istanbul Hilton in the mid-evening and, after a shower, returned to the lobby where he purchased a thriller before retiring to the comfort of an easy chair in the lounge. He continued to drink quietly for another hour before going in to dinner. Afterwards he adjourned to the cocktail bar for a nightcap. He was now feeling pleasantly intoxicated from the effects of a steady supply of alcohol, which had lifted his flagging spirits. He was now more at peace with the world of United Motors. Sipping a large Armagnac and enjoying the heady aroma of a Havana cigar, he had come to terms with the fact that life could, and would go on. Whatever lay ahead, maybe it was for the best. All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds, he mused, blowing a great cloud of smoke into the air above him. That's what Voltaire's Pangloss had said, wasn't it? And just look at the problems which had faced poor Candide. Maybe it was time for a change, anyway. Thirty years was a long time to stay with one company. Should have got out after the Steiner incident. Fool not to have done so. Early fifties is leaving it a bit late. Over fifty policy comes into effect. Fate perhaps. Do I believe in Fate? Really don't know. ‘There is a tide in the affairs of man, which taken at the flood, leads on to…’ heaven knows what and where. A voluptuous blonde hooker in a long white gown entered the spacious bar. The front was slashed all the way down to her navel to reveal rounded breasts, which rose and fell temptingly like a couple of ripe peaches. Just inside the entrance, she turned to survey the clientèle , making sure as she did so that all the men got a tantalising glimpse of a very long and elegant leg exposed through a side slit. The bar was fairly full, with groups of local worthies and their wives and a clutch of broody businessmen. From the attention which focused on her, it was obvious that the blonde would make a sale in no time at all. Eyes turned as she walked slowly across the room, brushing by this man and that. To his  surprise, she stopped when she reached Mark's chair and took the vacant seat beside him, nodding casually in his direction and flashing a devastating smile as she carefully arranged herself on display. She crossed her slender legs very slowly so that the panel of her dress fell away to reveal long, shapely limbs plus a glimpse of white satin briefs. Mark smiled the appreciative smile of a man who was just looking, not buying. Must be too expensive for the locals, he mused. Perhaps the fiddle sheet didn't run to outside entertainment more than once a month. Soaring inflation, perhaps. Up sixty per cent this year in Turkey, he'd read in The Financial Times . No…wait a minute. Devaluation of the Turkish lira. Down forty per cent. That's it! She's after the export business. She gives a much better exchange rate and gets forty per cent more lira for every pound, deutschmark or dollar she takes. Not bad, eh, when you're giving your all for your country? She smiled again, which Mark again returned, even though he was not in the running. Just an interested bystander, studying the form in the paddock and placing bets on who would be the jockey who would saddle her up. Chap at the far end of the bar in a grey pin-stripe clearly fancied his chances. Been ogling her up and down ever since she'd entered the room. Down boy, down! She's too expensive for you, even after allowing for devaluation. Where on earth were the Germans? They could afford her. God only knows how many lira there were to the deutschmark these days. Must be bloody millions. He watched her fumble for an intentionally long time in her handbag for the means of lighting the Turkish cigarette she held aloft in her left hand, only a foot or so away from Mark's head. He was an ungallant swine for deliberately not coming to her aid, but in truth he really wanted to see which of the likely lads, would dash forward. Surprisingly, there were no punters. At long last she looked up imploringly from the depths of her tiny handbag, which prompted Mark to produce his lighter. Thank you,’ she said, blowing a thin wisp of smoke in the air. ‘I thought you'd never respond. Are you waiting for someone?, Her voice was cultured and unmistakably English. ‘No, not really,’ he replied. ‘Just enjoying the parade in the paddock,’ he added casually. ‘So you ARE English,’ she said. ‘I thought so. Always give yourselves away, you chaps.’ ‘Is that so?’ he asked. ‘Do tell me, and what gives a destitute Englishman away in a foreign land? Decadence?’ ‘Style,’ she replied, throwing her long fair hair over her shoulders and flashing him the toothpaste smile again. ‘Style?’ ‘Style.’ He raised his eyebrows in surprise and softly sang the words of the song. ‘So you've got, or you haven't got…style.’ She finished the next line, ‘If you've got it, it stands out…a mile.’ They laughed together. ‘Sanders. Mark Sanders,’ he said, introducing himself. ‘Will you have a drink?’ ‘Love one. White lady,’ she replied. ‘Destitute Englishman,’ she scoffed dismissively. ‘My eye. With those shoes? British and Harrods to the last. Name's Virginia, believe it or not. But my friends call me Ginny. More appropriate.’ ‘So that's what gave me away. My shoes. Well, bless my soul,’ he said, with an air of exaggerated surprise. ‘They haven't got holes in have they?’ he asked in mock horror, glancing at the sole. ‘I wondered why you sat next to me, when you obviously had the field to play. Why pick on me?’ ‘I've told you. Style.’ she replied, with her winning smile. ‘And yes, I do like the company of my compatriots. Miss home quite a lot. Daddy fell from grace, poor dear. Lost everything, so I came out here. Well, a girl's got to live, hasn't she?’ She added brightly, ‘Much easier to be a fallen woman when you're miles from home. Must keep up the family tradition you know. Daddy always did say to do what you do best, and I am very good at it…so they say.’ ‘Are you now…?’ he replied. ‘Excellent references.’ She took the cocktail which the waiter had just brought. ‘Cheers,’ she said, raising her glass to him. ‘Happy nights to happy days.’ ‘Bottoms up,’ Mark said, raising his glass in return. ‘Of course. Bottoms up. Now that's an English expression I haven't heard in a long time. Must use it in the future. Very English and most apt.’ Mark glanced round the room. ‘Look, sweetheart, mustn't keep you away from the punters. By the looks of 'em, they are all champing at the bit to place their bets. And you are the hot favourite, bonny lass. No doubt about that. The others haven't a look in. Not in your class.’ ‘Aren't you a gambling man?’ she asked provocatively. ‘No, not me. Not any more. With my luck, Ginny, I'd lose if I backed the only filly in a one horse race,’ Mark told her, suddenly conscious of the fact that his speech was beginning to slur. ‘You couldn't lose with me,’ she said. ‘I'd give you a very good run for your money.’ ‘I bet you would. But it's not your performance I'm worried about, sweetheart. It's mine.’ ‘Never lost a rider yet’ ‘Always a first time,’ he said. ‘Bit out of practice,’ They laughed together at the sexy banter. ‘I like you,’ she said. ‘I like men who make me laugh. Especially in bed. I give encores, you know, when I'm happy.’ ‘At no extra charge?’ ‘No extra charge.’ ‘Bully for you,’ said Mark approvingly. ‘Always satisfy the customer if you are looking for repeat business. Reminds me of a piece of graffiti outside Saint Martin-in the-Fields. The poster said: ‘All ye who have sinned, enter here’ and a bright girl had written underneath: ‘All ye who have not sinned, ring Maida Vale 123456’.’ ‘Must remember that,’ she laughed. ‘Free advertising.’ ‘Smart girl. You'll go far.’ ‘How far do you want me to go?’ ‘I'm not sure I'm physically in good enough shape to take the excitement of the ride,’ he said, raising his glass to her. ‘Maybe you ought to find yourself a younger jockey.’ ‘Nonsense. You look in good shape to me, and anyway, I prefer more mature riders. They pace the race so much better.’ ‘Ah, the filly who prefers the leisurely canter to the short-lived gallop,’ he said appreciatively . ‘How eminently considerate. So what odds do you lay me finishing the course on the bookie's favourite?’ ‘Fifty,’ she said promptly. ‘Fifty to win is a lot of money to lay out on an untried filly.’ ‘Not this one, I promise you.’ ‘Dollars, or pounds?’ he asked. ‘Pounds of course. What do you take me for?’ she asked in mock surprise. ‘My dear Ginny, that's not in question. We've already established what you are. We are simply negotiating the price…! As I think George Bernard Shaw once said.’ ‘You beast. Hardly the way to win friends and influence people,’ she replied, pouting prettily. ‘You can soon go off someone, you know.’ ‘Sorry. My mistake. Mosht ungallant.’ He blinked and shook his head to bring the room back into focus. His speech really was slurred now. ‘So let's have a stirrup cup before that happens.’ He signalled the waiter. ‘Great idea.’ she said. ‘Bottoms up!’ A few minutes later, feeling decidedly the worse for wear after the last Armagnac had been downed, Mark moved unsteadily into the lift with his voluptuous mate. As they entered his room, she reversed against the door, closing it with her bottom. Draping her arms over his shoulders, she cradled his head in the palms of her hands, pulling him toward her to close a hungry, wet open mouth on his. Restlessly exploring with an eager tongue, she eased his  jacket from his shoulders. It fell noiselessly to the thick carpeted floor. He tugged at the zip on the back of her dress while she unbuttoned his shirt and removed his tie. She let the dress fall, pushing him away gently to slip out of tiny white satin briefs. She was naked as she drew him towards her. Her hands slid under his shirt, unbuckling, unzipping, thrusting on downwards. She kissed him again on the lips before mouth followed the path her hands were taking. ‘Do you like me?’ she whispered. ‘Ask a silly question,’ he gasped. ‘Fantastic!’ And then, suddenly, without warning, a bomb-burst of excruciating pain exploded inside his skull and sent him reeling. Head clasped in hands, he sprawled on the bed, gasping for air, as the room swayed crazily from side to side. It was sheer hell. Frightened by what had happened, the girl bent nervously over him. ‘Are you all right?’ she asked tremulously, taking care not to touch him. He struggled breathlessly to find the words. ‘Yes…be all right…terrible pain…give me a few minutes…be OK.’ She looked at the crumpled figure who was fighting for breath on the pillow, perspiration pouring down his anguished face. ‘Shall I get you a drink?’ she asked. He nodded. ‘Scotch…on table.’ ‘Cigarette?’ she asked. ‘No.’ She poured two glasses and gave him one. In the semi-darkness Mark could see her movements. She had a most beautiful body which looked opalescent in the half light. He took a gulp at the Scotch and gave a wry smile at the injustices of this world which caused him to be smitten with another one of those blinding attacks just when he was about to make it. Well, they always said it was the only way to go and he believed it. He was perspiring heavily as he sipped his drink, gazing  wistfully at the voluptuous creature who stood naked before him in the half light with a look of scared concern on her young face. ‘Shall I get a doctor?’ she asked, at length. ‘No. I'll be OK.’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Sure. Feeling a lot better already. Thanks.’ He moved himself into a reclining position, head against the padded headrest. The room started to sway again and the pains in his head intensified. ‘Told you I was too old a jockey,’ he joked. ‘Fell at the first fence.’ He was about to say ‘game to the last’ but thought again. She smiled at his efforts to be funny. ‘I was looking forward to the ride. Frustrated filly. Entered then scratched. What a palaver.’ ‘Have to be a stewards’ enquiry,’he said painfully. ‘Lot of money went on the favourite.’ ‘Under starter's orders, so I'm afraid no stake money refunded.’ ‘Of course,’ he said. ‘Jockey to blame.’ She walked to the bathroom and returned with a towel to mop his sweating face. ‘That feels good. Thanks,’ he said. She sat on the bed, mopping his brow. He closed his eyes. Not a bad looking devil, she thought. More than just a few grey hairs here and there. Plenty of lines on his face, which she hadn't really noticed before, but which were particularly noticeable now. No matter. They gave him character and sex appeal. About fifty, she thought. Why was it that she always found herself attracted to older men? More interesting, she supposed. She liked a man with a sense of humour. Had a good figure. quite looked forward to his love-making. Pity. She continued to pat his face with the towel. Wonder who he is? she thought. International business man, that's for sure. Written all over him. Married. No doubt. They all were. Wife who loves him, but who has gone off sex. How often had they said that. No ring on his hand, but that was nothing to go by. Very few married men wore rings these days. Can't blame them. Better chance to play the field. He was breathing less heavily now. Perhaps he was asleep. She dabbed his forehead. ‘Are you asleep?’ she whispered. ‘No,’ he whispered back. He wanted to say: ‘With a girl like you in the room?’ but was too exhausted to make the effort. She kissed him lightly on the lips and rose from the bed to get dressed. Taking his jacket from the floor she opened his wallet and took out two twenties and a ten before returning the wallet to the inside pocket. Putting the money in her bag she checked her face in the mirror and walked back to the bed. Are you asleep now?’ she whispered. ‘Yes,’ he whispered back, with the faintest of faint smiles. ‘I've taken the stake money,’ she said. He nodded imperceptibly. ‘Sorry you…but it wasn't my fault, was it?’ she said. He gave a slow shake of his head. She pulled the bed cover over him. ‘'Bye darling. Feel better soon. Look me up again when you are next in town, won't you? We must complete the course.’ Mark woke to the strangely sad and beautiful cry of the Muezzin, whose plaintive voice drifted across the ancient city to greet another dawn. The pains in his head had subsided, but he felt dizzy and sick, which he concluded was not surprising, considering the amount of alcohol he had drunk the day before. He attempted to go to the bathroom, but found that his left leg wouldn't respond. It felt heavy and lifeless, in much the same way as it had felt that day in Spain when he had gone off the road. He rolled on to his side and rubbed the leg vigorously with his right hand. After a few minutes he heaved himself out of bed, but his leg let him down and he fell backwards. From a sitting position he rubbed and thumped the leg until it responded sufficiently for him to drag himself to the bathroom. It was five o'clock. Hauling himself back to bed he lay awake for some time, before falling asleep. When he awoke again it was seven. To his great relief he found that the pains in his head had almost gone and that he could now move his left leg, albeit with some difficulty. After a while he was able to stand. He then walked slowly and gingerly towards the bathroom, keeping as much weight as possible on his right leg. A hot bath, followed by a cold shower worked wonders for his circulation, and he was now able to move more freely, though still with a pronounced limp. He shaved, got dressed and took the elevator to the breakfast-room. He felt in reasonable shape, as he entered the local MDs office."
FIC FIC-AC2-005 3.99 "That same evening Mark Sanders was dining alone in Istanbul after a satisfactory series of meetings with the local Managing Director and the Turkish Minister of Economic Affairs. He had declined an invitation to dinner, as the stabbing pains in his head had been getting steadily worse throughout the day. They were now blindingly bad. He placed his unfinished cigar in the ash tray and rose from the table, leaving his brandy untouched. He had decided to go to bed early. After lying in a hot bath for an unusually long time, he stretched out on the bed, eyes closed, hoping that the pains would go away. But he couldn't get the thought out of his head that in London, that very day, Muldoon and Klepner had given HIS Ten Year Plan to Cocello. The more he thought of the two carpet-baggers standing up at the podium, the more intense the pains in his head became. He put a hand to his forehead to ease the pressure. Nate couldn't possibly have believed that the Turkish problem was more important than the European Plan. Not in a million years. In which case the reason was blindingly obvious. Muldoon had more than hinted at what was happening. Detroit was paving the way for Mueller to take over and run the whole bloody show from America. That's what he had always wanted to do, and Klepner was his advance guard. His mole. His trained pet poodle who had been sent to Europe to reconnoitre the scene and steal Mark's clothes. He would then take over the European Components' planning activity when everything was centralised in Detroit. He thumped his pillow with his fist. The bastards are at it again, he said to himself, vividly recalling the Steiner incident in New York. Only this time it's curtains. He was finished. This had got to be the end of the road. He stared at the ceiling. How would he and Georgina change their lifestyle after all  those years as a corporate executive? How would they live? What would happen when the monthly cheque was no longer paid into the bank? What about the mortgage and the school fees? They go on for ever. Well, until sixty-five, and that's a hell of a long way away. What would they do in the interim? They'd have to move to a smaller house, that's for sure. My God, how would he tell Georgina? It would break her heart to leave the lovely old stone barn in Buckinghamshire. How could he keep Andrew at Agricultural college? Well they would, somehow or other. They'd done it for Adam and Christopher and they'd do it for him. But how would he break the news to Georgina that he'd let her down after all these years? He fell asleep, but the pains in his head were still there when he awoke in the morning. Clem Bunker was in a rare-rage. He had completely lost his temper when he had heard the news that Clasper had taken the giant Merseyside plant out on strike. Bunker had received the message from a convener at one of the Midlands plants, who was also hopping mad. And so, he said, were all the shop stewards at his plant, who were expressing the view that, once again, the Merseysiders were taking the law into their own hands, breaking national agreements and overturning official union policy. The Midlands' shop stewards knew it was only a question of time before the strike affected supplies to their own plants and those in the South, jeopardising the recovery plan which had been producing such vast improvements in performance. Morale had been at its highest for years, up to the moment that the news had reached them that Merseyside was out. ‘Clasper's behind this!’ Bunker was furious. ‘He was dead against the plan and now he's doing his damnedest to wreck it.’ ‘That's what everyone round here is saying as well,’ the convener agreed. ‘It's his Commie mate who got the chop. And nobody believes Clasper's version of the story. It's all too bloody coincidental.’ ‘Is that really the majority view at your plant?’ ‘Well, it's not often the majority express themselves without  some prompting from the shop stewards,’ the convener replied, ‘but in this instance the reaction was instantaneous. We heard the news over the radio at lunch break and I tell you, Clem, my lads are really up in arms. Nobody believes this cock and bull story about the sacking incident. They all know that Clasper's behind it. Who the hell does he think he's kiddin'? He's certainly not kiddin' my blokes.’ ‘Is that what the majority are really saying at your plant?’ asked Bunker. ‘Loud and clear,’ replied the convener. ‘They are sick to the eyeballs with Clasper and his bloody political conscience strikes. A hell of a roar went up in the canteen at lunch break when one of the shop stewards said that Clasper would go on fighting on behalf of the workers until every bloody one of them had lost their jobs. That's what my lads think about Mister bloody Clasper. The question is, Clem, what are you going to do about it?’ ‘I’ m going to contact all the plant conveners, when I put this phone down, and call an emergency meeting, Bunker told him. ‘In the meantime, get the shop stewards at your plant to take an accurate reading of the majority viewpoint without influencing the men either way. Initially, I want the gut feel of the members. We can take final readings and decide on an official union line when we know all the facts. I'm going to ask the other plant conveners to do the same.’ ‘OK, Clem,, the convener said quickly. ‘Will do.’ That evening, Bunker phoned Peters at The Inn on the Park to tell him that he had called an emergency meeting of plant conveners to help resolve the Merseyside problem. He was dismayed by the American's response. There was more than a hint of weary resignation in his reply. All the old fighting spirit and enthusiasm had gone. ‘Yeah. OK Clem. Thanks for ringing. and thanks for all the effort that you have put in personally. Just sorry it has turned out this way.’ He sounded like a beaten man. News of the strike made headlines in all the British newspapers. It was also given in-depth coverage on television and radio that evening, with News at Ten running it as the lead story in the first half of the programme and coming back to it again in the second. Clasper was interviewed outside the giant Merseyside plant and predictably blamed management for deliberately provoking the strike. ‘Are you really saying that the company is to blame for the strike?’ the man with the microphone asked, thrusting it under Clasper's chin. ‘Well you don't think my lads would be out here just for the bloody exercise, do you?’ Clasper demanded sarcastically. ‘Course they're to blame. Stands to reason. And my lads are staying out until Management reinstates the innocent victim.’ And is that the only thing which would influence you to call off this strike, which is obviously doing great harm to the company and the country?’ the interviewer asked. ‘Nothing more and nothing less,’ replied Clasper. ‘I'm already havin' to ask the lads to exercise great restraint over this particular issue. They want me to insist that the company sacks the foreman before they go back, but I've told 'em I won't be a party to victimisation either way.’ ‘Thank you, Mr Clasper,’ said the interviewer. ‘Now back to the studio.’ And there the newsreader told the British people that efforts had been made to obtain an interview with the local Plant Manager, who had declined to comment. The President of United Motors — who was in London at that moment — had also declined to comment on a local issue which, he had said was a matter for local management. The inference viewers gained was that management was to blame in one way or another. When he returned to the States, Mueller lost no time in carrying out Cocello's instructions to direct the phase-out of UK vehicle operations from Detroit, and to prepare detail plans to centralise European and world planning activities. His first step was to request that all copies of the European Vehicle and Components’ Plan be withdrawn from circulation. Having thus effectively stopped the Plans dead in their tracks, he then proceeded, in the name of the President, to dry  up the outward flow of all planning information from Detroit, so that, from that moment on, only he and members of the world planning group would be aware of what was going on, worldwide, at the planning stage. Mueller thus gained immediate planning control of world wide operations, even before he had formally received top management approval to proceed. The President had given Mueller an inch, but he had already taken a mile. This tactic was not unusual in the Corporation. Mueller had simply used his privileged position to advise the General Directors that he was operating on the instructions of the President. He would use that authority to his own personal advantage."
FIC FIC-BMW-004 4.78 "CHAPTER FOUR In her room at Hugo's Central Park triplex Harriet was dressed and ready for dinner. At home in London she rarely bothered with such irrelevances; here she knew it was expected of her and accordingly she had showered, dumped her travel-weary jeans into the laundry basket from which they would be rescued by a maid, washed, ironed and returned to her next day, and dressed herself in a loose silk jersey jacket and pants suit, simple and easy enough to please her yet enough of a transformation to satisfy her father and Sally. She was tired out now, her eyes ached from lack of sleep and jet-lag, and she glanced longingly at the king-sized bed with its lace-trimmed peach silk sheets. Oh to be able to fall into it and sink into oblivion! But it would be several more hours yet before she could do that. Was her father home yet? she wondered. She was anxious to see him the moment he arrived, and make sure he was all right after the trauma of the interview with the insurance investigator. But when she went to the head of the stairs and looked down she could see that his study door was ajar and the house was quiet and she returned to her room. He had said he might be late, after all, and she decided to snatch a few more moments of privacy to recharge her batteries in the one place in the whole luxurious house where she was able to relax and feel she was her own person. What was it about unashamed luxury, Harriet sometimes asked herself, which made her feel so uncomfortable? Most people would be only to happy to be able to enjoy such surroundings. A top line interior decorator had been given a free hand when Hugo had bought the triplex two years ago and no expense had been spared — the walls were hung with some of Hugo's collection of Old Masters, glowing against the background of watered silk, the shelves were lined with leather bound first editions which neither Hugo nor Sally would ever open, much less read, every nook and cranny was filled with treasures and objets d'art displayed on dainty pedestals. The sofas and chairs were deep and soft enough to fall asleep in, a fireplace was topped by an Adam mantel which Hugo had had flown out from  England and everywhere there were fresh flowers — long stemmed hothouse roses, orchids flown in from Singapore, daffodils and narcissi and heavy perfumed hyacinths. But to Harriet the grandeur and studied comfort were somehow artificial, the atmosphere more reminiscent of a luxury hotel than a home. Perhaps, she thought, it was because she had never lived in this house. There was nothing to arouse childhood memories. Only in the room Sally had chosen especially for her was Harriet amongst familiar echoes of the past and she never entered it without feeling a wave of gratitude towards her aunt. Here, at Sally's instigation, were many of the things Harriet remembered and loved from her childhood and growing-up years — the rosettes she had won with her pony, her graduation dress, her old collection of Osmond and Jackson records, her early attempts at photography, proudly framed, a pressed flower that reminded her of her first proper date. Small things, but important, the little touches that were typical of Sally and which made it possible to feel charity — and love — for her when she was fussy or critical or just plain annoying as she had been when Harriet had arrived without warning this afternoon. ‘Why didn't you let us know you were coming?’ Sally had chided when the taxi had dropped Harriet off and she had bundled unceremoniously into the house. ‘You should have called, darling, and warned us. I might have been out or anything.’ ‘There wasn't time,’ Harriet had said, kissing her. ‘And anyway, you weren't out.’ ‘No, but I will be tomorrow. I have a charity luncheon to attend and…’ ‘I probably won't be here tomorrow either. It's a flying visit only.’ ‘Oh if only I'd known! I'd have asked Mark to dinner. He's in New York, you know, though he insists on staying with a friend in that dreadful apartment over on the West side. He'd have loved to see you.’ ‘And I'd have loved to see him. But that's not why I'm here, Sally.’ ‘Why then? Oh no, don't tell me.’ Sally held up a manicured hand. ‘I don't think I want to know. Your father and I talked about nothing else last night. Harriet, I'm sorry, but I don't think I could stand to begin going all over that again — not just now. And I think I just might try to get hold of Mark. It might not be too late to invite him to dinner, If he's got nothing else planned. I'll warn Jane we shall be at least one, possibly two, extra…’ ‘Sally, hang on a minute.’ Harriet managed to interrupt her flow. ‘I can understand your reluctance to talk about what's happened but you can't just push it to one side. That's Dad's trick, but it's not like you.’ ‘It's just that I don't like wasting my energy worrying about things I can do nothing about,’ Sally said matter-of-factly. ‘Please, Harriet. I have had it up to here!’ She drew an imaginary line across the base of her throat, brushing her double-strand pearl choker. ‘Can't we just leave it?’ Harriet sighed. ‘No, I don't think we can. I called in to see Dad before coming here and while I was there an insurance investigator called Tom O'Neill came to see him. The same man was at my flat last night asking questions and for all I know his next visit will be here, to see you, so…’ She broke off. Sally's hand was clutching at her pearls now and she had turned very pale beneath her makeup. ‘Sally, are you all right?’ she asked swiftly. ‘An insurance investigator, you say?’ Sally repeated in a shocked voice. ‘That's right. There was a big pay-out on Mom's life, wasn't there? Well, the insurance company seem to have got it into their heads that If Greg Martin is alive Mom might be too. They're more or less accusing us of some kind of fraud.’ ‘My God,’ Sally said. ‘It's not the end of the world,’ Harriet exclaimed, irritated by Sally's uncharacteristic behaviour. ‘As Dad said, we have nothing to hide and hopefully he'll soon realise that and go away. But it's pretty unpleasant, especially for Dad, to have all this raked up. He's under a terrible strain.’ ‘Aren't we all?’ Sally said faintly. ‘Perhaps, but it's different for us,’ Harriet said, mindful of what her father had told her. ‘She was his wife, after all.’ ‘And your mother. And my sister.’ ‘Yes, I know that. But all the same… I think we should do all we can to support him. Sally, are you listening to what I'm saying?’ Sally was staring into space, still plucking at her pearl choker in agitation. A tiny muscle was working near her mouth, making her lip tremble. ‘I knew something like this would happen,’ she whispered. ‘It's what I've been afraid of.’ Harriet stared at her. ‘I suppose it's inevitable,’ she conceded. ‘But there's no point getting so worked up about it. I just wanted to warn you, that's all. And to ask you to support Dad.’ ‘Yes.’ Sally collected herself. ‘I expect you'd like to bath and change, Harriet. You must be exhausted. And I was going to try to get hold of Mark. I'll ask Danny to bring up your things.’ ‘It's all right, I can manage them. Don't bother Danny.’ Danny was the chauffeur. Harriet picked up her hold-all and escaped. She was puzzled by Sally's reaction. Anger, yes, she'd expected that. But Sally had seemed really upset, not at all her usual contained self. She was getting quite neurotic, Harriet reflected, and the same thought occurred to her now as she checked her image in the full length mirror, tucking her camisole top more neatly in at the waist of her pants and straightening the ornamental clasp of the loose belt she had fastened around her hips. She only hoped Sally was able to get hold of Mark. It would be nice to see him and his presence would lighten things. Mark always managed to be deliciously irreverent, no matter how heavy things got. It was the English in him, she supposed, that laid-back refusal to take himself — or anyone else — seriously. Somewhere in the house a telephone was ringing. Harriet took no notice of it but a minute or two later there was a tap at her door and a maid stood there with one of the portable receivers — there was no extension in Harriet's room. ‘For me?’ she asked, surprised. The maid nodded. Harriet waited until the door had closed after her and flicked the button, feeling oddly apprehensive. The last thirty-six hours had held too many unpleasant shocks for comfort. ‘Hello?’ ‘Harriet — it's me.’ ‘Nick!’ ‘Hi. I'm just about to go to bed and I thought I'd ring and see how things are with you.’ ‘Oh, I'm fine.’ ‘You arrived safely then?’ He sounded so close he might almost have been in the next room instead of the other side of the Atlantic ocean. ‘Yes. I've seen Dad and we shall soon be having dinner.’ ‘Good. Tired, I expect?’ ‘Exhausted.’ ‘But otherwise all right?’ ‘Yes.’ There was a silence. There was really nothing else to say. ‘I won't keep you then. I just thought I'd let you know I was thinking of you.’ ‘Thanks, Nick, it was sweet of you.’ ‘OK. Take care then, Harriet. And keep in touch.’ The slight sense of claustrophobia he could always arouse in her stirred. ‘Yes. Goodnight, Nick. Thanks again for ringing.’ Then he was gone and she held the receiver for a moment feeling unexpectedly bereft. He was so good to her. So caring. Why couldn't she let him in to that private part of herself that sometimes cried out for — what? But she couldn't. Nick was there for her and she was grateful, but that was all. The moment she knew it she didn't want him any more, simple as that. What the hell is the matter with me? Harriet wondered briefly. She glanced at her watch. Half an hour or so to dinner. She might as well go down, have a pre-dinner drink with Sally and see if her father was home yet. Halfway down the stairs she heard voices and through the partly-open drawing-room door caught a glimpse of Sally in peacock-blue cashmere and the tall figure of a young man, fine hair above a chestnut brown suede jacket. Her heart leaped and she ran the rest of the way like a child in her delight. ‘Mark! Oh, it's so good to see you!’ ‘Hey, steady!’ He set down his glass and hugged her. ‘Fancy you being in New York too. What a turn-up for the books!’ ‘I know. But I had to come. You've heard the news, of course.’ ‘Yes. I talked to Sally on the telephone last night. It must have come as one hell of a shock for you, Skeeter.’ It was his nickname for her; he had started calling her that when she was small and it had stuck even though she was now a respectable five-feet-seven. ‘For all of us.’ She glanced at Sally, but her aunt seemed to have regained her composure. ‘Is Dad home yet?’ ‘No. I hope he's not going to be much longer.’ ‘I left him with an insurance investigator,’ Harriet explained to Mark. ‘Mark — get Harriet a drink,’ Sally said. ‘I'm going to ask Jane to hold dinner back a bit.’ She hurried out, but not before Harriet had seen the haunted look was back in her eyes. ‘What will you have, Skeeter?’ Mark asked. ‘Oh — better make it Martini. I've already had one telling-off from  Dad today for drinking Scotch. If he finds me at it again he'll be convinced I'm on the slippery slope.’ ‘Right.’ He poured it for her and watched with one eyebrow raised as she gulped at it. ‘It's all been a bit bloody, I gather.’ ‘Yep.’ She brought him up to date with what had happened. ‘Your mother seems to have taken it pretty badly’, she concluded. ‘Yes, she does look a bit grey for her doesn't she? Of course she was very close to Paula, I understand. Anyway, let's talk about something quite different. What have you been up to?’ She told him about Paris and her new assignment for Focus Now. ‘And what about you?’ she asked. ‘How is the advertising business?’ ‘Booming. I think I've just sewn up a deal on a new account.’ ‘Good for you!’ She looked at him over the top of her glass. ‘You're spending a good deal of time in New York now, Mark. I thought you were in love with London.’ ‘I'm in love with wherever the business is. And at the moment it's in New York.’ ‘Are you sure that's the real reason? It's not that you're deliberately staying away from London by any chance is it?’ He tossed back his drink. ‘Now why should I do that?’ ‘Oh I could think of several reasons.’ She eyed him shrewdly. ‘But I think the most likely is that it has something to do with a girl.’ The moment she said it she knew she had hit the nail on the head. It was there in his expression though he feigned bored impatience. ‘Now why the hell should you think that?’ ‘Feminine intuition. Who was it, Mark? What went wrong? You must have cared an awful lot about her to deliberately stay away from London because of her. Now wait a minute — it wouldn't be that young fashion designer, would it? The one with the place over in Whitechapel?’ He set his glass down sharply. ‘What do you know about her?’ ‘Nothing really. Just that someone told me you'd been seeing her. It is her, isn't it? Oh come on, Mark, you can tell me!’ ‘Hasn't it occurred to you, Skeeter, that I might not want to? Being my step-sister doesn't give you a God-given right to know all my business.’ His tone was still laconic but she heard the undertones and was warned. Mark could bite If upset — and of course he was quite right, she shouldn't pry into what was none of her business. ‘Sorry,’ she said. ‘It's all right.’ But he still looked a little spiky. The girl must have  given him the elbow, Harriet decided. Most unusual — where Mark was concerned it was usually the other way round. ‘Shall we have another drink?’ he suggested. She hesitated, then pushed her glass towards him. ‘Why not? If Dad is going to brand me an alcoholic I might as well have the game as well as the name!’ When Hugo returned home dinner was served as soon as he had had time to change. It was a sombre meal in spite of Mark's presence. Hugo looked even more tired and strained than he had earlier, Harriet thought, and Sally was edgy and preoccupied though she seemed greatly relieved when Hugo told her that the insurance investigator, Tom O'Neill, had seemed satisfied with what he had been able to tell him and had not expressed any desire for a further interview or the need to come to the house to speak to Sally. ‘He tells me he is going straight on to Australia to see Greg,’ Hugo said. ‘Let's hope the whole thing ends there. Though somehow I doubt it.’ ‘Why? Why should you doubt it?’ Sally demanded. Harriet noticed her hands were shaking. ‘Because the son of a bitch won't let up while he thinks there is the slightest chance of getting back his quarter of a million,’ Hugo said. ‘Then why don't you just give it to him?’ Sally suggested. ‘It would be worth it, Hugo, to get him off our backs.’ ‘If that were the case he could have it and welcome. But it would simply look like an admission of guilt and I'm damned If I'm going to do that when I've nothing to hide.’ ‘Sydney, New South Wales,’ Harriet said irrelevantly. They all looked at her questioningly and she explained: ‘I was just thinking aloud’. ‘You're not still entertaining this foolish idea of going to Australia to try to see Greg Martin yourself, I hope,’ Hugo said sharply. ‘Yes’, Harriet said. ‘I am. I'm sorry, Dad, but I can't see it the way you do. I'm not prepared to simply brush it under the carpet and try to pretend it hasn't happened. I want to find out the truth.’ ‘For goodness’ sake, Harriet, don't do anything so foolish…’ Sally had turned pale again. ‘You don't want to see Greg!’ ‘It'll be a wasted journey. If he's in police custody as he may well be by now they'll never let her see him,’ Hugo said. ‘I intend to try.’ ‘All I can say is I hope you weren't too rude to that insurance investigator then,’ Mark put in drily. ‘If you want to see Greg then he's got to be your best chance. You should persuade him to let you pose as his secretary or something.’ ‘Oh for heaven's sake, Mark, do you have to make everything into a joke?’ Harriet demanded. ‘I'm not joking — I'm perfectly serious. He'll be given access to Martin, I should think. He is a professional investigator, after all.’ ‘I wouldn't ask him for help if I were on a sinking ship and he was the only one with a lifebelt!’ Harriet said decisively. At that moment Sally knocked over her glass of wine. It ran in a red river across the polished table top and cascaded onto her peacock-blue cashmere skirt. She leaped up, dabbing at it with a napkin. ‘Oh no! It'll be ruined! I must take it off at once and give it to Donna so that she can rinse it…’ She hurried from the room. ‘Sally is in one hell of a state,’ Mark said easily. ‘This business has made her really jumpy. She's not herself at all.’ ‘Is it surprising?’ Hugo snapped. ‘I should have thought anyone with a grain of sensitivity would realise how painful it is for all of us to have this all raked up again. as if it wasn't bad enough for us to live through it once…’ Harriet stood up. ‘I'll go and see if she's all right. I don't want any more dinner. I am honestly not hungry.’ ‘Neither I think are any of us,’ Hugo observed. In her room Sally eventually managed to get out of her dress though her hands were trembling so much she had great difficulty with the zipper. Then she kicked it away and sank onto the bed covering her face with her hands. God in heaven, where was this nightmare going to end? Was it really only the day before yesterday when everything had been so pleasant and normal? When she had been able to plan her charity lunches and her dinner parties, go shopping, gossip with friends, look at her life and know that at last she had achieved all she had ever wanted, even If sometimes it was a little lonely, a little empty? Now in every corner, wherever she looked, the ghosts of the past seemed to be congregating to mock her until she felt sure she must be going mad. A tap at the door and without waiting for her answer it opened a  fraction. ‘Sally?’ It was Harriet s voice, Harriet s anxious face peeping round. ‘Are you all right?’ ‘Yes.’ Somehow she got a hold of herself and went to pick up her dress. ‘How could I be so clumsy?’ ‘You're upset. Let me take the dress to Donna while you find something else to put on.’ Sally let her take it. Then before she could stop herself she asked: ‘You're not really going to Australia are you, Harriet?’ ‘Yes, I am.’ Sally caught at her arm. ‘Don't go, darling, please. You never know, you might find out something you'd rather not know.’ Harriet's brows came together in a puzzled little line. ‘Dad said something similar. You're afraid, both of you, that I might discover Mom isn't dead at all, aren't you?’ Sally said nothing, and Harriet went on: ‘You don't really think she could do something like that, do you? Disappear and let us all think she was dead if she wasn't?’ For a moment Sally did not answer. ‘Your mom was a very determined lady when she wanted something,’ she said, avoiding Harriet's eyes. ‘She usually got it one way or another.’ ‘You mean you dothink… Sally, she was your sister, dammit!’ ‘Yes’, Sally said softly. ‘She was my sister all right.’ She crossed to one of her closets, sliding hangers along the rail. ‘Go back to the others, Harriet. I'm all right. I'll be down in a minute.’ For a moment longer Harriet hesitated, then she nodded. ‘If you're sure you're all right.’ ‘Yes, really. Go along with you.’ The door closed after Harriet, and Sally rifled through her wardrobe looking for a dress of mauve-sprigged white seersucker, slightly yellowed now, and quite out of place amongst the designer gowns. She should have thrown it out years ago but somehow she'd never had the heart. She'd loved that dress, felt so grown up in it! She slipped it off its hanger and held it against herself and it was almost as if the face looking back at her from the mirror across it was fourteen years old again. As she stood there holding it the memories came flooding back — and not all of them pleasant. For she had been wearing this dress the night she had first glimpsed the truth about her sister, a truth that was as unpalatable now as it had been then. ‘Oh Paula!’ she whispered and suddenly tears were running down her cheeks, making rivulets in her carefully-applied make-up. ‘What happened to you? And dear God, what happened to me?’ She stood quite still, holding the dress with arms folded around her waist, and remembered."
FIC FIC-CB5-001 5.2 "From the very first moment of her return to the vicarage Ruth was caught up in a whirlwind of work. When she walked in at the back door Mrs Peterson said: ‘You're back then. Well, put on your apron. You're just in time to make a bit of pastry against tomorrow.’ Ruth supposed it was Mrs Peterson's way of taking her mind off the sad events of last week. But she would be surprised, Ruth thought — astounded, horrified — if she knew what other thoughts raced in her young servant's mind, if she could catch a glimpse of the vivid memories of what had happened with Dick Parker. Ruth went about her tasks in a dream, but her preoccupied state was naturally attributed to grief. ‘Only two weeks now to the mistress's confinement,’ Mrs Peterson reminded her. ‘Tomorrow we start to clean through the house, top to bottom. So it's up with the lark, my girl!’ She spoke as if Ruth had been away on holiday and must therefore have abounding strength and energy. ‘Florrie will be worse than useless,’ Mrs Peterson continued. ‘She's given her notice to leave, taken a living-in job in Skipton. She's no longer interested in what's to be done here.’ That turned out to be true. Florrie played around, taking twice as long to complete every task. She was full of talk about her new post. ‘It'll be a sight more lively than here,’ she said. ‘There's plenty going on i' Skipton.’ ‘There's enough going on here right now,’ Ruth told her sharply. ‘I'd be glad of a bit of help if you'd condescend to give it.’ Florrie looked at Ruth in surprise. ‘Hark at you! You have come back in a funny mood. What's got into you?’ ‘Oh nothing much,’ Ruth retorted. ‘Only that my father's dead, my stepmother's ill, and I'm worried sick about my grandfather! Nothing at all, really!’ She could hardly tell Florrie that, most of all, her mind was on Dick. He had already gone to his new job in Wensleydale, with a promise to return on his first free Sunday. Ruth's conscience was troubled over Dick: not because of what they had done together — that had been wonderful and whenever she thought about it her body ached, her breasts tingled with longing to experience it again — but because she now knew, had known it from the day after he had brought her home, that he was not the man she wanted to marry. It was strange that a sexual union which left nothing to be desired should so clarify the state of her mind. And still, and yet, she might marry him. She had not totally dismissed the idea. Married to Dick, she would be able to give her grandfather a home, would be free to renew that wonderful sexual experience as often as she wished, and, of course, to have children. Unlike Maria, Ruth had no limit in her mind as to the number of children she would eventually bear. It shocked her that she could make such a cool analysis of the situation. That alone told her that she was far from being in love with Dick. But she would be fair. When the time came for decisions she would not deceive him. If she agreed to marry him she would offer him what she could — affection, duty, loyalty — and he could decide whether it was enough. ‘Hard work drives trouble away,’ Mrs Peterson said, hearing Ruth's exchange with Florrie. She had a fund of such sayings, but this time she was proved maddeningly right. By the time the monthly nurse was installed once again, and Mrs Longhill was delivered of her second child — a daughter, to be named Prudence — Ruth had almost ceased  to think or dream about anything. Getting through the day, with her bed at the end of it the only goal, absorbed all her energies. A day or two after the baby's birth, with Mrs Longhill lying-in and the nurse making more work than the rest of the household put together, Florrie left. ‘We've no sign of anyone to take her place,’ Mrs Peterson said. ‘She chose to go at a very inconvenient time, I must say’ They were to have a full-time, living-in servant, who would share Ruth's bedroom, a prospect which did not please her. ‘It seems there are no servants to be had in the country,’ Mrs Peterson grumbled. ‘I can't understand it. And the vicar such a considerate man to work for.’ Fortunately the new baby thrived. She took the breast well and slept at night without the drops of laudanum with which the nurse had dosed the infant Benjamin when he could not sleep. Benjamin, who had been walking for a month, found himself less welcome in his mother's room and followed Ruth around the house like a pet lamb. She loved him more than ever. Ruth herself thrived too. In spite of all the hard work she began to put on a little weight. ‘You're getting quite mature in the figure,’ Mrs Peterson remarked. ‘Your bust is filling out nicely!’ If it occurred to Ruth — and how could it possibly occur to Mrs Peterson — that there might be a good reason for this, she dismissed it from her mind at once. It was true that she had missed a period, but that could mean anything or nothing. She was never very regular. She was not sick in the mornings and when occasionally nausea swept over her it was easily put down to fatigue, or to something she had eaten. Her mind refused to believe that anything could happen the first time one had intercourse. ‘Well,’ Mrs Peterson said, coming into the kitchen one morning a few days after the monthly nurse had left, ‘you'll be pleased to hear that the mistress has found a new servant  at last. But she has no experience so I don't know how she'll make out.’ Ellen Hardcastle turned out to be a fourteen-year-old wisp of a girl with mousy hair and pale blue eyes. She came from ‘over the hill’, from the higher part of Littondale, and she was as silent as her native dale. She missed her family badly. Getting ready for bed the first night she said, ‘I'm glad I'm sharing your room, Ruth. I've never slept on my own afore.’ Ruth hadn't the heart to tell her that she wasn't welcome in it. In fact she was as quiet as a mouse and Ruth hardly knew she was there. Later on she had good reason to be thankful that she was. With two babies in the house Ruth had thought, as Christmas approached, that there would not be much entertaining. She was wrong. Early in December Mrs Longhill actually came into the kitchen to discuss with Mrs Peterson the refreshments for a party she and the vicar intended to give. ‘We must remember our position in society,’ she said firmly. ‘The fact that we have now been blessed with two little ones must not blind us to our obligations, nor cause us to lower our standards.’ She spoke, Ruth thought, as if she were the mistress of a large establishment in London instead of a country vicar's wife in a remote Yorkshire dale. But marriage had completely changed Miss Caroline. There was nothing left of the friendship they had known in Barnswick. They were simply mistress and servant now ‘What she means,’ Ruth said pertly when Mrs Longhill had left the kitchen, ‘is that her servants must keep up the standards!’ She looked at the three of them: an old woman, herself not yet seventeen, and a raw child of fourteen. ‘Now then, miss!’ Mrs Peterson reprimanded. ‘Remember your place!’ But throughout December it was they who slaved away — or at least Ruth and Ellen did. Apart from being disinclined for work, Mrs Peterson was showing her age more  than ever and was not capable of sustained effort. ‘I'm handing the puddings over to you this Christmas Ruth,’ she said. ‘By rights they should have been made on Stir-up Sunday, only I was too busy. Perhaps we should say the collect anyway?’ So Ruth made the rich mixture and in turn the three of them stirred it, reciting meanwhile the collect for the Sunday before Advent. ‘Stir up we beseech Thee, O Lord, the wills of Thy faithful people; that they, plenteously bringing forth the fruits of good works, may of Thee be plenteously rewarded.’ Ruth added her own silent prayer that the puddings would be eatable. Since her father's death she had written regularly to her grandfather, but there had been no word in reply from Hester. She had also written to Maria, reminding her of her promise, begging for news, but when Maria at last replied the news was all of herself, nothing of Barnswick. ‘To my infinite regret,’ she wrote, in the flowery style she now affected, ‘I have been quite unable to visit my childhood home. There are so many diversions here that the time flies by on wings. I have recently been to a performance of Mr Handel's Messiah and, would you believe it the Second West Yorkshire Yeomanry is to hold a Regimental Ball in the New Year, in the Exchange Buildings!’ On and on she went, never telling Ruth what she wanted to know. Her only real news at this time came from Mrs Longhill. ‘My father tells me in his latest letter that Hester and the baby are doing well,’ she informed Ruth. ‘And Grandfather?’ ‘He does not mention your grandfather.’ Afterwards, Ruth could not remember that she had done anything unusual on the twenty-third of December. She and Ellen between them had turned out the dining-room, giving it extra spit and polish because of Christmas. When they went to bed that night Ellen, as usual, was asleep within minutes but Ruth, though deadly tired, was  curiously wakeful; not quite feeling herself but not able to put a finger on what was wrong. She fell asleep at last, but in no time at all the pain in her back wakened her again; insistent, demanding. Even before she had come to, it rapidly circled her belly with a sharpness which made her cry out — and waken Ellen. ‘What's the matter?’ Ellen sat up in bed, rubbing her eyes with her knuckles like a sleepy child. ‘I don't know,’ Ruth said. ‘Something I ate. The meat pie, I daresay.’ ‘Will I get you anything?’ Ellen asked drowsily. ‘No. Go back to sleep.’ The pain had left as suddenly as it had come, except for a small reminder in her back. But before Ruth could settle down to sleep again it returned, only this time much sharper, as if it would split her body in two. Against her will, she cried out with the agony of it. ‘I must fetch Mrs Peterson,’ Ellen said. ‘I must fetch her at once!’ Ruth made no protest. She was afraid of this savage pain, which was unlike anything she had ever known. Mrs Peterson came, and gave her a concoction. ‘Ground ginger in hot water,’ she told Ruth. ‘Nothing to beat it for shifting the wind!’ But nothing eased the pain. It engulfed her in successive waves, each one stronger than the last, and then it was one long pain, tearing at her guts. When she sat on the chamberpot to try to relieve it, the blood came. ‘Fetch Mrs Longhill!’ Ruth heard Mrs Peterson's voice from a long way off. The pain demanded her total concentration now. ‘I shall die!’ she gasped. ‘I'm going to die!’ ‘I think we must send for Dr Baxter,’ Mrs Longhill said hurriedly. ‘I will waken the vicar.’ Neither Mrs Longhill nor Mrs Peterson understood what was wrong with Ruth and it was not until half-past five next morning, when the doctor at last arrived, that a name was put to it. He had been urgently summoned by the sexton, whom the vicar had sent off on horseback, and he was annoyed at being dragged from his bed in Kettlewell, so early on Christmas Eve; especially as by the time he arrived it was all over. By then, drenched in sweat, and exhausted, all Ruth wanted was to sleep. The doctor was brusque in his analysis. ‘A miscarriage. There's nothing I can do. One way or another she brought it on herself. I daresay she's been drinking some concoction of raspberry leaves and pennyroyal. It's what these servant girls do to bring it on.’ Mrs Longhill looked from Ruth to the doctor, her eyes wide with horror, her face drained of colour. She swayed on her feet and the doctor put out a hand to steady her. ‘Dear lady, don't distress yourself so! She's not the first servant to get herself into trouble and she won't be the last. I sometimes think they get too much free time!’ ‘A miscarriage? Are you certain , Doctor?’ ‘Of course I am, Mrs Longhill. You didn't know the girl was pregnant?’ ‘Never,’ she whispered. ‘Never!’ He crossed to the basin. Mrs Peterson poured water from the ewer and he washed his hands. ‘Well, there it is. I suppose it's as well she lost it. There are enough bastards in the world.’ Bitter anger gave Ruth the strength to speak. ‘I suppose because I'm a servant, I suppose because I'm not married, me and my baby don't count for anything? Well he does to me, and I'll thank you not to call him a bastard!’ Her voice sounded strange to her; weak and croaking, but at the same time filled with a passion she had not known she felt. She hated this man. ‘That will do, Ruth!’ Mrs Longhill said sharply. ‘I will not countenance you being rude to Dr Baxter.’ The week which followed was amongst the most lonely of Ruth's life. Hardly anyone came near her and she was not told what was to happen. With the vicar's views on hellfire  she was sure she would not go unpunished, that he would feel obliged to deputise for God. Though it was clear that Mrs Longhill could hardly bear to talk to her, her mistress felt it her duty to ask certain questions. ‘Who is the father?’ she demanded. Ruth said nothing. She had not decided whether or not to tell Dick, but if he were to be told it would be by her, not by the Longhills. ‘How could it happen?’ Mrs Longhill cried. ‘How could it happen here ? I have cared for you as if you were my own family!’ ‘It didn't happen here.’ ‘Ah! So it was while you were in Barnswick?’ Mrs Longhill clutched at the idea. ‘And your father newly in his grave…perhaps not even in his grave!’ It was clear to Ruth that she had plumbed the depths of depravity. It had not seemed like that at the time. But if Mrs Longhill felt better that her servant had fallen from grace in distant Barnswick, then let her think it. It would keep Dick out of the picture. During the whole of Christmas Day Ruth lay on her back in bed. In the morning she heard people coming to church, and she wondered about Dick. He would have Christmas Day off and he would surely call at the vicarage on some pretext or other. What would they tell him? After morning service, when the last of the footsteps, and voices exchanging greetings, had died away, she heard the vicar ride off, the clip-clop of the horse's hooves as clear as a bell on the cold air. He would be taking Christmas communion to the sick. She should have known better than to think he would bring it to her, miserable sinner that she was. For her Christmas dinner Ellen brought her a bowl of oatmeal gruel. She never did discover how the puddings turned out. ‘There were a young man at the door after church,’ Ellen said. ‘He brought Christmas greetings from himself and his sister, who used to work here. He was ever so sorry not to see you but he wished you a merry Christmas.’ ‘What did Mrs Peterson tell him was the matter with me?’ Ruth asked. ‘She said you had a chill on the kidneys and you'd be in bed for a few days yet. He said he had to go back to work tomorrow. I can't stop,’ she added nervously. ‘Mrs Peterson says I mustn't talk to thee.’ Mrs Peterson came in to see Ruth just the once. ‘How could you do this to the vicar?’ she demanded. ‘And at a season like this, too, with all his extra services and obligations!’ Ruth was tempted to tell her that at the time she had not had the vicar in mind, but since Mrs Peterson had not come to bring her any comfort, she simply turned her face to the wall. The housekeeper left the room, muttering about ingratitude. On the thirtieth of December the doctor called again and pronounced Ruth fit to get up. Though she felt weak, it was good to be dressed again. She was ready to go downstairs to the kitchen when Ellen came into the room. ‘Mrs Peterson says you're to stay in your room until you're sent for,’ she said nervously. ‘Why?’ Ruth asked. ‘I don't know, Ruth. It's what I've been told to say.’ As Ellen scurried out of the room like a frightened mouse, Ruth sat down again. She had a strange, dull feeling in the pit of her stomach. What was happening now? She did not have long to wait. Fifteen minutes later Ellen returned, looking more scared than ever. ‘You're to go at once to the vicar's study,’ she announced. ‘Oh Ruth, throw yourself on his mercy! He must forgive you!’ ‘I don't need the vicar's forgiveness,’ Ruth said coldly. ‘He's not God, even if he thinks he is.’ ‘Oh Ruth, please don't talk that way!’ Ellen implored, her eyes filling with tears. When Ruth entered the study the vicar was sitting at his desk; a large mahogany desk with a green leather top, which Ruth polished with loving care every Wednesday. It was the  piece she liked best in the whole house. He did not raise his head as she came into the room, and not once in the short interview which followed did he look at her. Instead he fixed his eyes on his hands, which were clasped together on the desk, studying them as if the words he must say were written on his bony fingers. He unclasped them just long enough to push a small packet across the desk towards Ruth. ‘Here are your wages in full,’ he said. ‘At my wife's generous insistence I have not deducted one penny for the week you have spent in bed under our roof, being nursed back to health by the kindness of your mistress's heart.’ Ruth took a step forward and picked up the packet. Her instinct, almost irresistible, was to throw it at him, but she was fast learning that there were impulses which a person in her position could not afford to follow. ‘I need hardly tell you,’ he continued in his dry voice, ‘what a blow you dealt to she who cared so much for your welfare. You have wantonly and cruelly deceived her. You will now pack your belongings and be ready to leave the house within the half-hour.’ His voice was smooth, cold; nothing of hellfire in it. Ruth thought she would have preferred it if he had shouted at her. ‘You mean I'm dismissed?’ she asked stupidly. ‘Naturally! You do not suppose that I could continue to employ you in a house where I have the welfare and character of two innocent children in my charge? Even Mrs Longhill, generous though she is, would not agree to that. Nor can you hope for a reference. What could I say of you?’ ‘You could say that I had worked my fingers to the bone for you!’ Ruth cried out. ‘That I have cared for your son and loved him as if he were my own.’ ’ I will thank you not to speak of my son,'he said evenly. ‘And now — and again because of my wife's insistence, because of her concern for your health — I have hired a conveyance to take you to the railway station at Skipton.’ ‘Then may I bid farewell to Mrs Longhill?’ Ruth asked. ‘No,’ he replied. ‘She realises that such a move would be too upsetting for her. You will go to your room now, and  when you have packed you will wait there until the conveyance arrives.’ When he had finished speaking he sat there silently, his head bowed, waiting for her to leave. She could not move. The shock of his words had so drained what little strength she had that for a moment she was powerless to take even one step. ‘That is all,’ the vicar said. And then a swift, burning anger, such as she had never known in all her life, welled up inside her, rose like bile in her throat. It came to her aid, bringing her all the strength she needed. She took one step forward and picked up the paperweight from the vicar's desk — a large pebble upon which Mrs Longhill had painted wild flowers as a birthday present for her husband. She raised her arm and flung it hard at him, not caring where it hit him, wanting only to hurt him as the whole world had hurt her; wanting to see his cold, impassive face break with ordinary human emotion. He had no time to move. Her action was so swift that he was hardly aware of it until the stone struck him full in the face. Blood poured from his nose, splashing in large crimson blots on the sheaf of white paper in front of him. But Ruth did not care. She did not care if he bled to death in front of her. She was too angry to be frightened. ‘But that isn't all I have to say!’ she screamed. ‘You are a devil! You aren't a man, you're a devil! You have no love, no charity, no compassion in you. I hope God punishes you as you've punished me!’ In the middle of her outbursts, she noticed that the paperweight had fallen on to the desk, badly marking the surface. For a split second she felt sorry about that. Then she tore from the room. She was dimly aware of Mrs Longhill running in but she brushed past her and flew upstairs to her bedroom. Anger gave her the strength to pack her few belongings and by the time Ellen — red-eyed and in tears — came to say that the conveyance was at the door, there was no sign left that Ruth had ever inhabited the room. For the last few minutes before Ellen appeared, Ruth stood by the window, looking down the dale. Her passion had cooled now. She felt weak, and without hope. But not repentant, not one bit repentant. It was a sunless day, the clouds low, obscuring the tops of the hills and threatening rain. The dale had weather to match every mood, Ruth thought. In the two years or more that she had been in Nordale she had almost come to think of it as home. Now it was unlikely that she would ever see it again. For most of the journey to Barnswick Ruth deliberately tried to think of nothing, to let her mind go blank. But thoughts pushed their way in. What should she do? Where could she go? Would Dick, even if she wished it, still want to marry her? And what about Grandfather? Need she tell Grandfather the truth — it would break his heart. Could she not say that it had been her own choice to leave the Longhills, that they were not suited to one another? But sooner or later Mrs Longhill must write to her father and he would feel obliged to speak to Ruth's family. Ruth thought he might be kinder than his son-in-law, but it was not something he would take lightly. Perhaps Mrs Longhill had already written during the days Ruth had been confined to bed. Since the railways had come the post travelled more quickly, and it was possible that her grandfather already knew everything. And Hester of course. At this very moment they might be expecting her arrival. When Ruth went into the house Hester was sitting on an upright chair by the table, peeling potatoes. Pansy was playing on the rug in front of a small fire and Willie sat surrounded by his toy animals. The baby slept peacefully in its cradle. Ruth saw at once that her grandfather was not in the room, but she took it for granted that by some miracle he had improved enough to get upstairs and was resting in bed. It was a stupid thought, but no other explanation occurred to her. Hester looked startled by Ruth's appearance, and jumped to her feet. ‘What are you doing here? What do you want?’ she demanded. Ruth stared at her. It was reasonable that Hester should be surprised, but her attitude was definitely hostile. ‘I came home…for a visit,’ she temporised. ‘Is Grandfather asleep? Can I waken him?’ Hester stared at her without speaking. ‘What is it?’ Ruth asked quickly. ‘There's something wrong, isn't there? Is he ill?’ ‘He's gone,’ Hester said. ‘Where did you think he was? Hiding under the table?’ ‘Gone!’ Ruth shrieked the word at her. The baby wakened and started to cry. ‘Gone! Why didn't you let me know he was ill? Why didn't you send for me?’ She was beside herself, shouting at the top of her voice for the second time that day. Willie screamed. ‘I said he's gone,’ Hester shouted back. ‘I didn't say he was dead, did I? Stop yelling at me, miss!’ Ruth felt dizzy with relief. She was still weak from her miscarriage and the journey had been trying. She must try not to take things the wrong way ‘I'm sorry. You startled me. I misunderstood.’ He had gone to Aunt Sarah's, of course. They had fetched him for Christmas and he was staying on for the New Year. Ruth heartily wished that he could stay there for good. ‘You mean he's gone to Aunt Sarah's?’ she said more calmly. ‘I wish I'd known. I'd have gone straight there.’ She was too tired now to walk over the moor but she would set off first thing in the morning. She knew she wasn't welcome in Hester's house but Mrs Johnson would give her a bed for the night. ‘He's not at thy Aunt Sarah's neither,’ Hester replied. Fear gripped Ruth again. ‘Then where is he? What are you keeping from me?’ ‘He's gone to Dudley House,’ Hester said reluctantly. Everything that the day had contained came together in Ruth's head. She thought, for a moment, that she must go  mad. Then she skirted the table, gripped her stepmother by the shoulders, and began to shake her as if she was no more than a rag doll. ‘Dudley House!’ she shrieked. ‘You sent my grandfather to Dudley House? How dare you do such a thing?’ Dudley House was the workhouse. It was reputedly neither fit for man nor beast; ‘reputedly’ because few people who went in there ever came out to tell the tale. The dread of one day being an inmate darkened the life of every poor person for miles around. She continued to shake her stepmother, screaming in her rage. Shock alone, since the older woman was physically far more powerful, rendered Hester helpless in the girl's grip. She could do nothing except cry out. ‘Stop, Ruth!’ Willie cried. ‘Go away! Stop hurting my mam!’ It was Willie's words which brought Ruth to her senses. She let go of Hester and Willie ran to his stepmother, flinging his arms around her. Once out of Ruth's grasp, Hester recovered quickly. ‘I dare all right,’ she retorted, her voice shaking with anger. ‘Because there's nowt here to keep him on. If it weren't for the bit I earn I daresay me and my bairns would be in Dudley House an' all. And your Willie. It's my toil as keeps us, and it won't stretch to your grandfather.’ ‘Why couldn't he go on Parish Relief?’ Ruth demanded. ‘Because he's got nowt to begin with. If you have a little bit, then they make it up wi' Parish Relief. If you have nowt — then it's the workhouse. It's as simple as that.’ ‘Why didn't you tell me?’ Ruth persisted. ‘Could you have given him a home?’ ‘I could have sent him some of my wages.’ ‘Well you didn't, did you?’ Hester replied. ‘I don't recall that you sent owt. Anyway, it weren't only money. He needed a lot doing for him. Sitting there, day in, day out, hardly able to get off his backside. I've got plenty on wi'out him. Three children and no husband.’ ‘Why didn't you tell Aunt Sarah?’ Ruth asked. ‘Surely she'd have had him?’ ‘Thy Aunt Sarah's badly,’ Hester said. ‘They didn't come over at Christmas because she's i' bed wi' bronchitis. No use to bother her. No, Dudley House is the proper place for such as your grandfather. They get fed and looked after, don't they? What more do you want?’ ‘Fed and looked after?’ Ruth cried. ‘Are you mad? Up at half-past five every morning, winter and summer. Chopping wood, sawing logs, binding firewood. As for food — do you call a bowl of thin pea soup food? Do you? But he shan't stay! Make no mistake about it, he shan't stay!’ On the very next day she would get her grandfather out of Dudley House. Of that she was certain. What they would do, how they would manage, she had no idea. She had the few pounds from her wages (and thank heaven she had not thrown it back in the vicar's face). That would keep them, perhaps, in some cheap lodging-house until she could decide what was to be done. She was young and strong. There must be something. ‘When did he go?’ she asked Hester. ‘Day after Christmas they took him. He's been there five days now. I dare say he'll have settled down, gotten used to it.’ ‘He doesn't have to settle down,’ Ruth said. ‘I shall have him out tomorrow.’ With that she turned and went out. Mrs Johnson was as kind as ever and willingly agreed to give her a bed for the night. ‘I saw him go,’ she said. ‘It were a cold day. He looked perished. But you mustn't be too hard on Hester. She's had a bad time and no mistake.’ But Ruth was in no mood to make allowances for Hester. It was surprising, she thought, that Mrs Johnson didn't ask her what she was doing in Barnswick. Ruth had decided to say she'd been unwell, and had been given a few days off to recover her strength. Indeed, except that she was deadly tired, she had herself almost forgotten the reason for her homecoming in the more important matter of her grandfather's plight. Ruth left Barnswick next morning. Dudley House was just  outside the village of the same name and the easiest way to get there was to walk. She was feeling better after a night's rest — surprisingly, she had slept well. ‘Make a good breakfast,’ Mrs Johnson advised. ‘And I've packed you a currant teacake for a ‘biting on’, though you should be at Dudley afore dinnertime.’ Ruth planned to find somewhere in Dudley where she and her grandfather might stay for the night. With a place to take him to, she thought, the Workhouse Master would be more likely to let her grandfather go with her. If the workhouse was as overcrowded as everyone said, then surely they'd be only too pleased to get one inmate off their hands? In the village she stopped at the blacksmith's. ‘I'm looking for lodgings for me and my grandfather,’ she said. ‘Somewhere homely, and not too expensive.’ The blacksmith straightened up and looked at her. He saw a tall thin girl, with dark hair escaping from under her bonnet. Large amber-brown eyes, filled with anxiety, met his. She was about the same age as his own daughter but she looked as if she had the troubles of the world on her. ‘I reckon Mrs Taylor will look after thee,’ he told Ruth. ‘She sometimes takes lodgers.’ Ruth took to Mrs Taylor the moment that lady opened the door. She had the same kindly look as Aunt Sarah. Moreover, she had a room to let on the ground floor, with two beds. ‘A shilling a night, to include supper and breakfast,’ the landlady said. Ruth paid in advance for the first night. She thought it a mite expensive, but it looked a respectable place, and Mrs Taylor had been sympathetic about Grandfather. ‘I could tell you a few tales about yon place,’ she remarked, jerking her head in the direction of Dudley House. ‘Tales as would make your hair stand on end!’ Ruth hoped she wouldn't, at least until she had Grandfather safely out of it. ‘I've some stew and dumplings only needs warming up,’ Mrs Taylor said. ‘You look as if a good meal wouldn't come amiss.’ When she had eaten, Ruth set off for Dudley House. It was about a mile from the village, set back from the road, with tall iron gates, securely locked, at the entrance, and a few yards inside them a lodge. The big house was visible at the top of the drive. It was several storeys high, with many small windows, some of which were barred. Ruth rang the bell at the gate and a man came out of the lodge to attend to her. ‘My grandfather's in here,’ she said. ‘I want to speak to the Master about him.’ ‘Oh you do, do you?’ he replied, not unkindly. ‘Then you'd best come in. I don't know as the Master'll see thee. He's a very busy man. First off, what's your grandfather's name?’ ‘Enoch Appleby. He came here five days ago, just after Christmas. I've come to get him out.’ From the look he gave her she thought that mustn't happen often. ‘I've got lodgings,’ she went on. ‘He's to live with me. So could I please see the Master and arrange it as quickly as possible?’ The man continued to look at her strangely, and then at last he said, ‘It'll not do you any good, love.’ ‘You can't tell,’ Ruth replied. ‘If I could just see the Master I could explain to him. It was a mistake, sending my grandfather here!’ ‘What I mean, love,’ the man said slowly, ‘is that it won't do you any good, nor your grandfather neither. You see, lass, he died the day afore yesterday.’ She stared at him. It couldn't possibly be true. Not her grandfather; not when she had come to fetch him; not at last when he was going to live with her and everything was going to be all right. Why was this man lying to her? ‘You must have made a mistake. Perhaps you've got the name wrong?’ Her voice was sharp, pleading with him. He had to be wrong, otherwise she couldn't bear it. The man consulted a list pinned to the wall, then turned back to her, shaking his head. ‘I'm sorry, miss. There's no mistake. A letter was sent to his next-of-kin, Mrs Sarah Gaunt. I thought you'd likely come from her, to collect his bits and pieces. Not that there's much. Are you Mrs Gaunt's daughter?’ So it was true. It was all true. Grandfather, how could you? How could you leave me when you knew I'd come for you? She thought she was crying the words aloud, but all that came back to her was her voice — flat, low, saying, ‘She's my aunt. I'm Ruth Appleby.’ ‘Ah! Then there's a letter for you,’ the man said. ‘It's with his things.’ ‘My grandfather couldn't write,’ Ruth answered mechanically. ‘Happen not. He'd have got someone else to write it for him. Any road, here it is, plain as a pikestaff, Miss Ruth Appleby. Now will you take the rest of his things, or will Mrs Gaunt be coming?’ ‘I'll take them,’ Ruth said. He handed her a small bundle. ‘We like you to open it on the spot, just in case there's a query.’ It contained a bible, a penknife with a horn handle, a clay pipe, and the verse which she had written out for him two Christmases ago: ‘For hearts of truest mettle, Absence doth join and time doth settle.’ At the end of a lifetime this was the sum total of her grandfather's worldly possessions. ‘Will you open the letter now?’ the man asked. ‘No. Later. Can I see my grandfather?’ ‘Nay lass, you're too late,’ he said gently. ‘He were buried yesterday, on the Parish. We had the usual instructions that in the event of his death he should be buried here, and in those cases we don't wait. We haven't the room, you see.’ Those would have been Hester's instructions, Ruth thought. A pauper's grave. ‘I can show you the place,’ the man offered. ‘If we don't take too long. Just wait while I lock up here.’ He took her to a graveyard high on the slope behind the house. ‘It's consecrated,’ he said. ‘You don't need to worry about that.’ Ruth surveyed the freshly-turned earth and looked around for a flower she could place on the grave, but it was the last day of December and there was nothing in bloom. Everything was dead, dead, dead. She wished she was too. If her grandfather's grave had been open she would have thrown herself in. She could think of nothing to live for. When she got back to the lodgings she sat down in her room and opened the letter. ‘My Dearest Ruth (she read) I want you to have my bible and the penknife is for Ernest. Don't fret for me lass. I've had a long life and many blessings and you've been one of the best. Be a good girl. Your loving Grandfather Enoch Appleby’ It was more than she could bear. She heard her grandfather's voice in the words. She saw him on the morning they had sat in the sun outside the cottage door. She smelt the sweet scent of the gillyflowers. She flung herself on the bed in a paroxysm of weeping, wailing like an animal in pain — until Mrs Taylor came running, and took her in her arms. ‘At least,’ Ruth sobbed, held against Mrs Taylor's plump form, ‘at least he never knew the worst about me!’ ‘The worst?’ Mrs Taylor said comfortably. ‘A young innocent like you? What is there to know?’ Where can I go now? Ruth asked herself. Who would have her? The only hope was Aunt Sarah. It was too late today. Her aunt's house was all of seven miles away and darkness fell early at this time of the year. ‘Dry your eyes, love, and I'll get you a bite to eat. No use mourning on an empty stomach. Then I'll put a warming pan in your bed and you can get an early night.’ She slept hardly at all. There was too much to think about, both past and future. She couldn't expect to stay long with Aunt Sarah; where would she get a job? With the prospect of supporting her grandfather she had somehow  been full of confidence about the future. Now it had all left her. All through the night she thought about the problem. When morning came, bitterly cold and still dark, she had made up her mind. She knew what she must do. ‘Happy New Year, love!’ Mrs Taylor said, reminding Ruth, as she left Dudley that morning, what day it was. ‘Happen you'll have better luck in 1849,’ she added. ‘There's nowt like a new beginning.’ But you can't wipe out the past as if it didn't exist, Ruth thought. Walking away from Dudley — with the feeling that once again she was deserting her grandfather — she thought back to the moment on last New Year's Day when she had looked down Nordale from her bedroom window, all eagerness for what 1848 would bring. Well, now she was glad to be rid of it. When she reached Aunt Sarah's Ernest opened the door. ‘My word, this is a surprise and no mistake!’ he exclaimed. ‘Come in, our Ruth. Happy New Year!’ She followed him into the kitchen. ‘Look what the wind's blown in, Charlotte!’ he said. Charlotte came forward to greet Ruth, little Enoch at fourteen months tottering unsteadily behind her. ‘You look frozen,’ she said pleasantly. ‘Come over to the fire and get warm.’ Ruth stretched out her hands to the red glow, wondering if she would ever again be warm all through her. There was no sign of Aunt Sarah. ‘Ma's in bed, poorly,’ Ernest told her. ‘She were taken bad afore Christmas and she's slow to mend. But the sight of you will do her good.’ ‘The letter hasn't arrived then?’ Ruth asked. ‘You mean you wrote to tell us you were coming?’ Ernest  said. ‘Nay, we've heard nowt.’ ‘So you don't know Grandfather's dead?’ She made no attempt to break it gently; her mood was not tactful. ‘You none of you know how he died in the workhouse and was buried in a pauper's grave?’ Ernest stared at her in astonishment, Charlotte standing silently behind him. ‘You didn't know that while you were having a good Christmas, Hester was making arrangements to send him away?’ Ruth accused him, her voice sharp and cutting. Ernest's face flamed. He stepped forward and took hold of Ruth's wrists, as if he would forcibly stop her. ‘Now hold on, Ruth! Hold on! No, we didn't know any of that. Did you?’ ‘No,’ Ruth admitted. ‘How could I?’ ‘And how could we, do you suppose? Do you think we'd have let it happen if we'd known? I wrote to Hester just afore Christmas, explaining about Ma being badly. She didn't write back.’ ‘She wouldn't, would she?’ Ruth said bitterly. ‘Poor old Grandad!’ Ernest said. ‘Poor old gaffer! I'm real sorry, Ruth love. Had you best be the one to break it to Ma? She'll be very upset.’ Ruth went upstairs. Frost, like thickly appliquéd lace medallions, patterned the bedroom window, and water in a cup by the bedside had formed a solid block of ice. She was thankful that she still wore her cloak. Propped up in bed to ease her breathing, her nightcap pulled down over her ears, Aunt Sarah seemed to have shrunk inside the shawls which had been heaped upon her against the chill of the room. Ruth supposed that there wasn't enough coal for her to have a fire in the grate, but this was no way to cure a bad chest. Ruth stood in the doorway of the room for a few seconds, looking at her aunt who was drifting on the edge of sleep. Presently, Sarah opened her eyes and saw her visitor. A wide smile of welcome broke over her face as she brought her niece into focus. Seeing Aunt Sarah so unusually ill and  helpless, Ruth was filled with grief for her sake at the news she had brought. ‘Why, Ruth love, I thought I were dreaming! Whatever are you doing here? But whatever it is, it's welcome. You'll do me more good nor a bucket o' medicine. Come here and give us a kiss!’ Ruth kissed her aunt and then, clasping her hands tightly in her own, she said what she had to say as gently as possible. ‘Nay lass!’ Sarah said. ‘Nay lass, it's a bad do!’ She searched around for further words to express her grief, but could find none, and kept repeating herself. ‘Nay, but it's a bad do!’ Tears ran down both their faces, and though neither could shoulder the other's pain, they were glad of each other 's company in their sorrow. ‘You know I'd never have let it happen like that,’ Aunt Sarah said presently. ‘Not i' a thousand years. Not my own father! He were a good father, Ruth. Always had time for us when we were little. Always listened. I wouldn't have let it happen.’ ‘I know,’ Ruth assured her. But it had happened. She wondered again what her grandfather's thoughts and feelings had been in those few days at Dudley House. Was it because he had no hope that he had lasted so short a time? Or was it just possible that right to the end he had believed that she would find out, and come to him? She prayed that it was so, but she would never know. She was aware what her aunt's next question must be. ‘And I suppose you've come home for a day or two's holiday? Well, that was Providence all right! When must you go back?’ So Ruth told her the truth, but not quite the whole truth since she kept Dick's name out of it. That was wiser than she knew since it deflected her aunt from the shock of the announcement and gave her something to pursue. ‘But Ruth, the man should marry you! Surely he'd marry you if he knew?’ ‘He wanted to marry me before any of this happened,’ Ruth said. ‘I daresay he still does. But Aunt Sarah, I don't want to marry him. If I was still having the baby I daresay I'd consider it, but losing it made it quite clear to me that I didn't want what he offered.’ She thought about Dick, standing there on Fleet Moss, offering her his promised land. But it was not for her; ‘But you liked him?’ Aunt Sarah pleaded. ‘You must have liked him?’ ‘Of course,’ Ruth said. ‘I still do.’ ‘There's many a good marriage founded on liking,’ her aunt told her. ‘It's stuff as lasts. And he'd have made you a home.’ ‘I know,’ Ruth replied. ‘That would have been my main reason for marrying him. I don't love him, Aunt Sarah.’ ‘But Ruth love,’ Sarah said gently — and she had not uttered a word of reproach —‘you need a home! What are you going to do? How will you get another job? You know I'd have you here, love, but it's not possible. Whatever shall you do?’ Ruth took a deep breath and summoned all her courage to put into words what she had decided after her sleepless night at Mrs Taylor's. ‘I'm going to America!’ she announced. ‘No, don't say anything yet, Aunt Sarah! Just listen. I've thought it all out.’ ‘It's our Ernest put you up to this,’ Sarah interrupted. ‘He's the one who's been at you!’ ‘No he hasn't, Aunt Sarah. It's not even been mentioned between us. I don't know for sure that Ernest is going  to emigrate.’ ‘Oh, he's going to do that all right,’ Sarah said angrily. ‘He's already joined the emigration society. He's up the earholes i' pamphlets and instructions and information. He thinks I don't know, but I do. All he's waiting for is his number to come up. And now he's persuaded you!’ ‘He hasn't!’ Ruth protested. ‘I may have got the idea from him in the first place, but that's all. I'd decided to go whether he did so or not. If he'll have me with him and  Charlotte, then so much the better for me.’ ‘You'd never have done this if your grandfather had been alive!’ Aunt Sarah cried. ‘Happen not,’ Ruth agreed. ‘But he's not. And Willie doesn't need me. There's no place for me here. You as good as said it yourself.’ ‘But you'll marry, Ruth. There'll be someone come along…’ ‘And rescue me? I don't want that. I don't want marriage as a lifeline. I want what I want,when I want it. I want to be me, Ruth Appleby. I want to belong to me . Not to anyone else.’ ‘Rubbish!’ Sarah's tone was scathing. ‘You're talking daft. You're still only a bairn, Ruth love. If you go to America you'll still have to depend on someone for a living.’ ‘But I'll earn it,’ Ruth said. ‘From now on I want to make my own way in the world, be independent.’ ‘Now you sound just like our Ernest. But it's not the same for a woman, it can't be.’ ‘Perhaps it is in America. Who knows? And I'm not afraid.’ But of course she was. Deep inside she was terrified. ‘Now I think you ought to get some sleep, Aunt Sarah,’ Ruth said. She started to tuck the bedclothes more closely around her aunt, but Sarah pushed her away. ‘Sleep?’ she cried. ‘With all you've just said on my mind? Are you daft or summat? I'm getting up and coming downstairs. If there's any plotting and planning going on I want to be there. I'm not lying i' bed while you tell me what bit you want me to know!’ By this time she was out of bed and Charlotte was running upstairs to see what the commotion was about. ‘You can get me my clothes,’ Aunt Sarah ordered her. ‘I'm getting dressed. Ruth'll give me a hand. You tell Ernest to see there's a good fire for me to come down to.’ It seemed as though anger had given her the strength that rest in bed had failed to produce. Or perhaps, Ruth thought, it's the challenge of the situation. After all, she's an Appleby! ‘Now we'll say nothing to the others about your little affair,’ Sarah cautioned when Charlotte had left the room. ‘Except that later I shall have to tell your Uncle Matthew. Him and me have never kept things from each other. But he's fond of you. He'll not be one to judge harshly.’ ‘Thank you, Aunt Sarah,’ Ruth said. ‘And I do understand how you feel about the rest, about the emigration. I really do.’ Sarah stopped in the act of fastening her stays around her vast body. In the ice-cold room the sweat of weakness beaded her forehead and her upper lip. ‘Oh you do, do you?’ she said. ‘You understand, do you? You know what it's like to bear a child and bring him up and see him leave you and go to the other side of the world, knowing you'll not see him again? You know what it's like to part wi' your grandchild, to know there'll be others you'll not set eyes on? You understand how it feels when you can't read a letter, nor write one in reply? You understand all that, do you? Well, you're a clever young woman, Ruth Appleby!’ Her words went in like a knife. Ruth could find no answer. When her aunt was dressed she walked slowly down the narrow staircase in front of her in case, in her weak state, she should stumble. From New Year's Day onwards, the whole of 1849, the last year she expected to spend in England, was to Ruth simply a period of temporising; of waiting, though seldom patiently, for the only event which had come to mean anything. It was not a time of inaction, for there was plenty to be done. If Ernest was keen, Ruth was ten times keener. While he and Charlotte went steadily ahead making their preparations, Ruth rushed at hers as if the summons to depart might arrive the very next day. In theory that was possible. She had quickly joined the emigration society of which her cousins were already members, and it had been agreed that she should count as part of their family. Each month lots were drawn for the names of  the next families to leave, and the fortunate ones were given only a short time to make their final preparations. Charlotte was busy with preparations of another kind. She had confided to Ruth that she was pregnant again. ‘Only don't tell Ma,’ she begged. ‘She'll be that angry wi' me. Anyway, she'll know soon enough.’ Poor Charlotte, Ruth thought, to be married, yet not able to take pleasure in her pregnancy — though she perhaps misjudged her mother-in-law a little. ‘When is it due?’ Ruth asked. ‘The middle of June.’ Ruth caught her breath. It was when she would have had her child. When he knew of his wife's pregnancy Ernest requested that none of their names should go into the ballot until after the baby's birth. ‘I don't want you confined on board ship, love,’ he said. ‘Let alone on that trek across America!’ Although they would land in New York, they were to go immediately from there to Wisconsin where the English, including several families from the West Riding of Yorkshire, had begun to settle. ‘Happen you'll change your minds when the babby comes,’ Aunt Sarah remarked when she heard. ‘Who in their right senses would want to take a babby in arms on a journey like that?’ ‘It's no use, Ma,’ Ernest said gently. ‘My mind's made up and you'll not change it. I've begged you and Father to come with us. There's older folk than you have taken the step and I reckon it'd be a better life for both of you. I don't believe it's Father as won't go. It's you is the obstinate one!’ Once, when they were alone together, Ruth asked her aunt, ‘Why won't you come? What's the reason?’ ‘It's not that I'm afraid of living in a strange place, Ruth. I could do that — aye and work hard an' all. But…’ She faltered. ‘But I'm afraid of dying there — and that's the truth. When you get older (she was not yet fifty) you begin to think about death. It's frightening. But to be where  you've always been makes it easier. And I've lived hereabouts since I were born. I wouldn't want to die in a strange land.’ ‘But you'd have your family around you,’ Ruth pointed out. ‘When the time comes that will make up for everything.’ ‘My roots are here,’ Sarah said quietly. ‘They go deep. If you were a gardener, love, you'd know as there are some things you can't transplant. Disturb their roots and they wither. I'm like that, Ruth.’ She and Uncle Matthew had agreed, in spite of her strong disapproval of Ruth's plans for the future, that she should live with them until the time came to leave. Ruth slept on a sofa downstairs. She didn't mind. In any case, nothing was for long. She was grateful not only to be with her aunt and uncle in that last year, but to be near Ernest and Charlotte so that they could discuss, usually when the older couple had gone to bed, the life which lay so tantalisingly before them. Ernest regularly had advice from the emigrants'society and this he would read out aloud. ‘Take a good supply of flour and biscuits. Take a good book or two. Keep yourself clean from head to foot and provide yourself with opening medicine in case of need. Be ready to work hard in your new country…’ He broke off. ‘I'm ready to do that,’ he said. ‘I'll work all hours God sends.’ ‘So will we all,’ Ruth agreed. ‘Go on reading.’ He found the place again, following the text with his forefinger. ‘Prepare for difficult times, and ask for God's blessing on your venture.’ ‘There's a long list of equipment here,’ Ruth pointed out. ‘Look! A strong iron pan for cooking our food on board. No end of clothing.…’ ‘It'll take us all our time to afford that lot,’ Ernest said doubtfully. ‘But it just goes to show,’ Ruth said, ‘that they were right when they said emigrants shouldn't wait to leave until they were too far gone in poverty, but should go while they still have enough to provision themselves.’ ‘It's sound enough advice for those that can afford to follow it,’ Charlotte remarked. Ruth had been fortunate enough to find a job in Ilkley. The landlord of the inn which Ernest visited when his mother and his wife became too much for him knew of a coffee-house in the town which needed a kitchenmaid, and because he put in a good word for her, Ruth was given the job without references. She was paid four shillings a week and given her midday meal. She thought it was good pay, but well earned. Every week she was able to give Aunt Sarah something for her keep and she had a little left over to save. She managed to persuade Ernest to take a proportion of this to augment his savings. It was hard for him to scrape together more than a few coppers at a time. ‘I don't like taking your money, Ruth,’ he protested. ‘It's not right.’ ‘But it is,’ Ruth argued. ‘You must know that the companionship of you and Charlotte in a strange land will be beyond price to me.’ She should have realised, there and then, by the glance Charlotte gave her husband and the way in which he refused to meet it, that her plan to accompany them was a bone of contention. But she pretended to herself that she had not seen it, or that she had misinterpreted it. She hated her work in the coffee-house, standing all day long at the sink in the ill-ventilated pantry. She was glad when her work was done and she could walk back to the farm, filling her lungs with the keen moorland air. She cherished those walks. Every tuft of grass, flower, bird, was precious to her and she wanted to store them in her memory, against the day when they would no longer be hers. As the long, cold winter merged into spring she wondered if America, or any place on earth, could be as beautiful as her native moors. She wrote to Dick, not mentioning her miscarriage, telling him of her plans. ‘I know I could have made you happy, Ruth,’ he replied. ‘And if ever you want me, you know  where I am.’ She wished with all her heart she could have found contentment with him. Throughout that spring they saw nothing of Maria, and only the occasional letter came. She clearly had no time for Burley Woodhead when there was so much going on in Bradford. ‘She's gotten too grand for us,’ Aunt Sarah said. ‘I don't think so,’ Ruth replied doubtfully. ‘But you know how she always likes to be in the centre of things.’ Then at the beginning of summer Maria wrote to say that she was coming to spend a few days with them. But a day or two before she was due, Ernest returned from Ilkley with unwelcome news. ‘There's cholera in Leeds and in Bradford,’ he said. ‘It looks as if it's bad, an' all.’ ‘Ruth, you must write at once to Maria,’ Aunt Sarah urged. ‘Tell her she mustn't come yet. We have to think of little Enoch.’ ‘And of Charlotte,’ Ernest pointed out. ‘She's not strong at the moment. She's fit to catch whatever's going.’ So Ruth wrote at once, asking Maria to postpone her visit and bidding her take care of herself. She gave her letter to the postman with a heavy heart, wondering if she would ever see her sister again. Charlotte's daughter was born on the first of June, a week or two earlier than expected. ‘She's to be named ‘Jane’ after Charlotte's mother,’Ernest said. ‘I could wish she was stronger, and Charlotte happier.’ Aunt Sarah shook her head. ‘I'd be glad to hear the little mite cry more. It's not natural for a babby to be so quiet.’ Eventually, both mother and baby gained strength, and Ruth saw relief replace worry in Ernest's face as his daughter began to thrive, and his wife to smile at him. On a day in autumn Ruth told her aunt, ‘They say the cholera's on the wane now. It would be safe for Maria to come. I do so long to see her, Aunt Sarah!’ ‘Then invite her, love. You've been right patient,’ Aunt Sarah said. Maria replied that she was to be allowed to come for two days in the week following her letter. ‘I shall ask for two days holiday myself, then,’ Ruth said. ‘And if the old skinflint won't give it to me I shall take it just the same. He can do what he likes about that!’ She was on her way to Ilkley, to meet Maria, when she saw the postman climbing the hill. ‘There's a letter for your Ernest,’ he told her. ‘I reckon it's from them emigration people.’ He usually guessed at the contents of letters, and stood around waiting for his guesses to be confirmed. Ruth's heart began to thump so loudly that she thought he must hear it. ‘I'll turn back and take it myself,’ she said, trying to sound calm. They were all in the kitchen where she had left them a few minutes earlier. Aunt Sarah was at the table, kneading the bread dough; Ernest and Uncle Matthew, back from the top field, were taking a late breakfast. Charlotte sat feeding her baby while Enoch played on the hearthrug. Ruth handed the letter to Ernest. It seemed to her that they must all know what it contained. Ernest opened it in silence, his hands trembling. Aunt Sarah stopped kneading. Uncle Matthew cupped his hand around the mug of tea he was holding. For a single moment, Charlotte stopped suckling the child. The only sound in the kitchen, while they watched Ernest reading the letter, was from Enoch, happily singing a nursery rhyme. ‘We've drawn lucky!’ Ernest said quietly. ‘We sail out of Liverpool next March the eighth on the Flamingo , bound for New York.’ Sarah's hands, imprisoned in the bread dough, could not wipe away the tears which ran down her face. They dropped in the earthenware bowl, and were absorbed, so that when, later, Ruth helped to eat that morning's baking, she imagined she could taste the bitterness of the tears. Her uncle gazed at the tea in his mug as if the hot liquid might be the  Atlantic Ocean itself. Charlotte said nothing, but her face lit up with pleasure and she bent her head over the baby so as not to show it. ‘March the eighth,’ Ruth said, breaking the long silence. ‘My eighteenth birthday. Perhaps that's a good omen?’ It was a cruel, tactless thing to say and she could have bitten out her tongue the second the words were spoken, but the excitement bubbling inside her was too much to contain. ‘I'm sorry, Aunt Sarah!’ she cried. But Ernest was by his mother's side, his arm around her shoulders. Without speaking, she elbowed him out of the way and continued with her baking, thumping and banging the dough into shape, all the time her tears falling silently. Ruth went out of the house and ran down the steep moorland path all the way to Ilkley. She must not be late for Maria. The next day Ruth persuaded Maria, not without difficulty, to walk over to Barnswick with her. ‘I don't see why we should!’ Maria protested. ‘I've little enough time as it is.’ ‘I want to see Willie,’ Ruth said. ‘I want us all three to be together. It might be for the last time.’ She had to make sure that Willie was happy, and thriving. Having been all this time contented about his welfare, now that her leaving was fixed and certain, she had begun to have misgivings. Supposing Hester should turn against him? ‘Of course she won't,’ Maria said. ‘You know she'd never do that.’ ‘All the same, promise me that you'll visit him often when I've left — make sure that all goes well with him.’ ‘I promise.’ ‘Swear it on our mother's memory,’ Ruth insisted. ‘I swear it.’ ‘And you'll write often and tell me about him?’ ‘Yes. Oh do stop it, Ruth!’ So they walked across the moor. The heather had faded from its summer brilliance, emerging a deeper, softer  purple from the counterpane of autumn mist which covered the ground. Although Ruth now knew that she would be on the moor throughout the coming winter, and perhaps if she was lucky see the first, early signs of spring, she knew she was now taking her farewell of its chief beauty. She would not see the heather again. Much as she had wanted her sister's company, she almost wished Maria was not there. She wanted to fling herself to the ground, to lie there with her body pressed against the purple glory. For the rest of the journey Maria prattled on about Bradford, but Ruth did not hear a word. When Ruth saw Willie she realised that she need not have worried about him. He had grown another inch or two but he was still plump and rosy, with a solid contented look about him. He greeted his sisters with a mild show of affection but it was obvious that his home was here with Hester, and that he was happy in it. Hester, except that she was a little thinner, seemed no different. Ruth doubted that anything would dim her stepmother's exuberance for long. No reference at all was made to Enoch Appleby, though Ernest had written to Hester with the news. But Hester made them reasonably welcome. ‘I daresay you'd like something to eat,’ she said. ‘I'm ravenous!’ Maria admitted. ‘And you, Ruth?’ ‘I'm not hungry,’ Ruth replied quickly. ‘Thank you all the same.’ Hester shrugged. ‘Suit yourself. Then I'll boil you a fresh egg, Maria.’ She knows, Ruth thought, that I could never take another bite from her. But she had not come to quarrel with Hester, she had come to see Willie. She must get it over with quickly, and leave. Every minute she was in the house where she had spent most of her life, crowded as it was with memories of her parents and her grandfather, made it more difficult to bear up. If she was not to break down completely, and in front of Hester, she must  say goodbye to Willie, and go. She bent down and took him in her arms. He pulled away, startled by the vehemence of her embrace. ‘It will be a long time before I see you again, Willie,’ she said. ‘Be a good boy, won't you? Always say your prayers, and ask God to bless your Ruth.’ Then she ran out of the house, bumping into Tom Firth, the landlord of the Shoulder of Mutton, as he came in. ‘Why, it's Ruth!’ he exclaimed. She ran past him without speaking. He turned and watched her, puzzled. He had known Ruth since she was born. Her father had been his best friend. Why would she do that? He shrugged, and went in to see Hester. Ruth had called to see Mrs Johnson, looked in on one or two of the other neighbours, and was halfway up the hill to the churchyard before Maria caught up with her. ‘We had a lovely tea,’ Maria said. ‘I had two eggs and some seed cake. Why didn't you stay?’ ‘What a question!’ Ruth exclaimed. ‘You know I wouldn't take anything from that woman, and I don't know how you can, Maria.’ ‘I can easily. Hester was pleased to see me, to give me a meal. But then you were never fair to Hester, were you? Right from the beginning you were against her.’ ‘You liked her because she was always giving you things,’ Ruth accused her sister. ‘Making you pretty clothes.’ ‘I liked her because she was amiable and good-tempered. I like pleasant people. They're more fun.’ ‘Your feelings don't go very deep,’ Ruth said angrily. ‘If they did you'd hate her for what she did to Grandfather.’ ‘And yours go too deep,’ Maria answered. ‘You take a pride in feeling everything deeply. I think that's rather boring. I did love Grandfather, and I'm sorry he died, but I'm not going to hate Hester to please you.’ Ruth closed her lips firmly. She would simply not say another word on the subject. She didn't want to quarrel with Maria, today of all days, when they had so little time left together. She went into the churchyard and found their parents' grave. There was no headstone, but it was neatly tended and there were fresh flowers in a stone jar. Had Hester placed them there? Was it true, what Maria said, that she had never been fair to Hester? She pushed the thought away. For a few minutes she knelt by the grave, and was presently joined by Maria. Then without speaking she stood up and walked away, down the hill, back towards the moor. Maria caught up with her as they reached the end of the village. ‘Why do you want to go to America if it makes you so unhappy?’ Maria asked. ‘Who says I'm unhappy?’ ‘Anybody can see that. You're a streak of misery.’ ‘It's just that I don't like leaving places — or people,’ Ruth said. ‘That's all. But I still want to go. It's my best chance. Wouldn't you like to go, Maria? Wouldn't you like to come with us?’ Maria pulled a face. ‘Not me! Not into the wilderness tilling the ground, milking the cows. At the mercy of wild animals and insects and snakes and goodness knows what horrors! No thank you. Give me the city! Now if you were settling in New York…’ ‘We shall be in New York less than a day,’ Ruth said. ‘But I'm sure Wisconsin's not as bad as you make it sound.’ ‘I daresay it's worse!’ Maria replied. ‘Oh Maria, I shall miss you so much!’ Ruth cried thrusting her arm through her sister's as they walked. Christmas came and went and Ruth was glad to see the back of it. There was neither joy nor peace in the house and she found herself wishing the time away until it should be March. She could not bear her aunt's desperate face, nor her uncle's increasing silence. By the beginning of February they had collected together most of their provisions. Tea, oatmeal, sugar; a precious jar of goose fat for rubbing into the children's chests should  they take bronchitis on the journey. They took senna pods and a small bottle of brandy against bowels under- or overactive; a bottle of Dr Barton's cough mixture and, of course, their bibles and prayer books. From her savings Ruth had bought new boots, stockings, a warm flannel petticoat and a gown made of Yorkshire wool. ‘Though it's nowhere near as much as they recommend,’ she said. ‘And we have even less,’ Charlotte replied. ‘Which is a blessing in disguise,’ Ernest broke in. ‘Because how are we going to carry it all, with two bairns besides? Don't forget, either on thee, that every ounce has to be carried in bundles on our backs!’ ‘How are we to get to Liverpool?’ Ruth asked, not for the first time. It was their constant anxiety. ‘If the worst comes to the worst we shall have to take the train to Manchester. If we gave ourselves time we could walk from there to Liverpool. I'm loth to spend money on railway tickets,’ Ernest said. ‘We'll need every penny we have when we get to America.’ ‘I suppose you'd like us to walk all the way to Liverpool?’ Charlotte put in crossly. ‘If it weren't for the children, I would,’ Ernest admitted. ‘If it were summer I'd do it even wi' the children. We could push a handcart. Plenty of folk as good as us have done it.’ ‘Well I'm not going to,’ Charlotte declared. ‘And that's flat!’ ‘Don't carry on so,’ Ernest replied patiently. ‘I've said it's the wrong time of the year for that. No, unless I can come up wi' something soon, it'll have to be the train.’ As late as the end of February it looked as though this was what they would have to do, and then one evening Ernest returned from a visit to Ilkley flushed with excitement. When he entered the kitchen, bringing a great gust of cold air with him, he was all smiles. He pulled Charlotte into his arms in an embrace so fierce that she drew back, staring at him. ‘Nay, I'm not drunk!’ he assured her. ‘I've only had my usual pint. But I've got good news, lass!’ Aunt Sarah did not so much as lift her head from the rug she was making, but Ruth watched the way the rug hook stabbed the canvas with increased speed and vigour, as if she wanted to hurt it, and Ruth knew that her aunt was as tense as she was herself. ‘I met up wi' Alfred Carter,’ Ernest said. ‘You remember Alfred? Well, he's working on the canal now, going 'twixt Bingley and Liverpool, carrying cloth. One thing led to another and he says if we're so inclined, and we don't mind a bit of inconvenience, he'll take us all on the barge to Liverpool — and nothing to pay! We'd only have to walk as far as Bingley. It's a rare chance.’ Aunt Sarah's rug needle dropped from her fingers and clattered on the stone floor. ‘Rare chance!’ she flared. ‘Hast lost thy reason, Ernest Appleby? Hast taken leave of what little sense thou were born with? Two little bairns — one of 'em nobbut a babby — five days and five nights on a canal barge at this time o' year?’ ‘Don't fly off the handle, Ma,’ Ernest said. ‘I don't doubt but what Alfred'll rig up a bit of shelter. And we'll wrap up warm. Anyway, it's the best bet so far.’ ‘Best bet!’ Aunt Sarah stormed. ‘You must be mad!’ ‘Leave him be, Sarah,’ Uncle Matthew said gently. ‘He's old enough to know what he's doing.’ Ernest turned to Charlotte and Ruth. ‘Well, what dost think? Will it do?’ ‘It will for me,’ Ruth said. ‘And me,’ Charlotte agreed. ‘As long as we take proper care of the children.’ ‘We must be prepared to put up wi' a bit of discomfort,’ Ernest said. ‘But don't worry, the good times will come later.’ Aunt Sarah was right in saying that it would take five days to reach Liverpool, since the barge could go no faster than the horse which pulled it. Then, fearful of things going wrong — their greatest dread was that they would be late and that the ship would sail without them — they decided to allow an extra twenty-four hours. On that last night they finished packing their bundles, tied them securely and left them in the kitchen ready for the morning. After that there was a good meal of mutton stew and Aunt Sarah's feather-light dumplings (none of which anyone could eat) and they went to bed early. For Ruth it was impossible to sit there in the kitchen, seeing Aunt Sarah's stricken face, in a silence which was more deafening than words. Ruth thought her aunt would have sat up all night to prolong the time with them, but her uncle — who had tried bravely all day to behave as though nothing untoward was happening — put his arms around his wife's shoulders and led her away to bed. She went as if to her execution. Ruth did not sleep much, and when Ernest came downstairs next morning she was already up and doing. ‘Half-past five,’ he said softly. Ruth opened the door and went outside. There were stars in the clear, dark sky, and a white frost over the moor. It would have been easier to set off in the daylight but it wasn't possible. They had a long walk over the moor to Bingley and Alfred Carter couldn't afford to wait for them if they were late. When she went back into the house her aunt was busy with the last meal she would prepare for her family. They forced themselves to eat the porridge, the eggs fresh from the nest, for they had a long day before them. The last hour on the farm was an eternity. It seemed to Ruth, what her aunt had long suspected, that to part with loved ones while they are still living, with never a hope of seeing them again, was worse than losing them by death. For a moment, just before they left the house, as she and her aunt clung tightly to each other, the silent tears coursing down their faces, Ruth hated America and wished that it had never been discovered. But once they had left the house, and were at last too far away to hear her aunt's and uncle's farewells, or to see them as they stood outside in the yard, silhouetted against the lighted kitchen, excitement began to creep into Ruth and her spirits began to lift. They met up with Alfred Carter sooner than expected. He  was waiting for them with his barge by the first footbridge over the canal as they came down from the moor. It was almost daylight now, still cold and frosty. The horse blew great jets of steam from its nostrils as it stood on the towpath, patiently waiting for them to board. There was a minute cabin on the barge, no more than a place for the bargee to take shelter. ‘For you ladies and the children,’ Alfred Carter said. ‘It will keep the worst of the weather off.’ ‘If it's all the same to you,’ Ruth said, ‘I'd like to stay outside for a bit. At any rate until we've gone through the locks. Perhaps Enoch would like to watch with me?’ She had seen locks working before, but never these famous ‘five-rise’ ones, the longest ‘staircase’on the canal. She stood on the deck while the water rushed in through the sides of the great oaken gates, lifting the barge higher and higher until they were level with the water in the next basin. Then the gates opened and they went through. It was an experience to be repeated many times as the canal climbed to the top of the Pennines. ‘If you think that's exciting,’ Alfred Carter laughed, ‘just you wait until you go through the tunnel!’ By regular standards, Ruth supposed, the canal journey was uneventful. At night she and Charlotte crowded into the cabin with the children and they kept each other warm. The men sheltered under a tarpaulin slung across the corner of the barge. To relieve the tedium of the days they sang, or told stories to Enoch. Sometimes Alfred allowed Ruth to leave the barge and walk beside the horse on the towpath, to stretch her legs. And then at last they came to the tunnel. At the entrance a small boy and a youth were waiting. ‘Lead yer hoss ower the top, mister!’ the boy shouted. ‘Gi' yer a hand wi' the legging!’ the youth offered. Alfred Carter accepted both offers. Had she known what was in store, Ruth thought afterwards, she would have begged to walk over the top with the horse. ‘Now,’ Alfred said. ‘You'll not like this next bit. This  tunnel's a mile long, and it's dark and wet. You two ladies would be best off in the cabin wi' the children.’ Ruth had heard about ‘legging’. She knew all about it in theory and tried to explain it to Enoch. ‘You lie on your side on the edge of the barge, raise your legs until your feet touch the wall, and then make a walking movement. You have to push hard against the wall to drive the barge forward.’ ‘He's too young to understand,’ Charlotte protested. ‘Are you coming into the cabin or not?’ ‘Not,’ Ruth replied. She had a better idea. She turned to Alfred Carter. ‘I'm the same height as the youth you've hired,’ she said.’ Seeing there are three of you, it would make sense if I made a fourth and helped to leg.’ Alfred looked at her in astonishment. ‘You can't leg,’ he told her. ‘It's not a job for a woman.’ ‘Canal women do it,’ Ruth said. ‘It's not very…’ He sought for the right word. ‘…seemly!’ He meant that her skirts would have to be tucked up around her waist. ‘As it will be dark, that won't matter,’ Ruth said. Reluctantly, he agreed, and Ernest and Ruth took one side while Alfred Carter and the youth took the other. ‘We must all keep in time,’ Alfred instructed them. ‘I'll call out the rhythm.’ Ruth tucked up her skirts and clenched her teeth, and as Alfred called out the beat she pushed hard against the slippery wall, and was relieved and delighted to feel the barge moving. She hated every minute of the tunnel: the thick, inky darkness, the icy water which dripped from the limestone roof; the dank, sour smell and the lack of air. When the first shaft of light showed at the end of the tunnel it was like waking from a nightmare. ‘That's it, then!’ Alfred Carter said briskly. ‘It's all downhill from now on. We shall soon be in Liverpool!’ The Flamingo was a three-masted ship, what Ernest described as ‘square-rigged’. Though when they set eyes on her, her sails were furled, to Ruth she looked magnificent. Except in pictures, she had never seen a ship. ‘It's such a beautiful name,’ she said ecstatically. ‘It sounds so romantic. She'll be like a great bird, skimming over the water.’ ‘I don't care if she's called the Quacking Duck just as long as she's steady,’ Charlotte replied. The dockside was the busiest place Ruth had ever seen in her life. Between passengers waiting to board, porters, sailors, orange-sellers, touts, piled-up cargo, there was scarcely room to move. All around them people sat on their boxes and held on to precious bundles, patiently waiting for whatever might happen next. Some were eating, and Ruth guessed that they had broken into the food supplies they had brought for the voyage. A few lay on the ground in exhausted or inebriated sleep, oblivious to children and dogs who clambered over them, or to the kicks from porters who found them in the way. ‘Why can't we go on board?’ Charlotte asked. ‘Do we have to stand here all day?’ Jane was crying; a fretful whimper, as if she was struggling to fall asleep and could not. ‘Here, let me take her,’ Ruth said. Somewhat reluctantly, Charlotte handed over her daughter- and looked displeased when the baby fell asleep almost at once in Ruth's arms. Ruth could never understand  Charlotte's unwillingness to let her help with the baby. It seemed as though she liked to keep those she loved to herself, as if by sharing, some part of them would be lost to her forever. ‘I'll try to find out what's happening,’ Ernest said. ‘Don't any of you move an inch from here and don't take your eyes off those bundles. I don't doubt this place is full of rogues.’ He sounded irritable, which was unlike him. He had been brusque and taciturn all morning, giving short, sharp answers to Charlotte's questions. Ruth could almost have believed that he wanted to turn around and go back home. All her apprehensions were swallowed up in excitement, but then she did not have the responsibility of a wife and family. But when Ernest returned he sounded a little more hopeful. ‘They'll still loading cargo,’ he told them. ‘After that we can go aboard. But first we have to go to the doctor's shop to get our health certificates. That's it yonder.’ He pointed to a hut in front of which a line of people was already forming. ‘We'd best get over there,’ he said. ‘It might be a long business.’ Apart from waiting in the queue it was the shortest business Ruth had ever encountered. The doctor sat at the open window of the hut, from which position, without ever moving, he examined the passengers. He scarcely glanced at her. His eyes were fixed on the forms which he was signing and stamping as fast as he could go. ‘Do you feel well?’ he asked. ‘Never better.’ ‘Tongue,’ he snapped. She put out her tongue but he did not examine it. He was already handing her the piece of paper which certified that she was in good health and not suffering from any infectious disease. His examination of her cousins was every bit as cursory. By the time they had their health certificates the cargo, mostly cotton cloth from Manchester, had been stowed. ‘Emigrants are the chief cargo on this ship. I only  hope…’ Ernest's words were drowned in the call which went up from the ship, and the outburst of cheering from the Flamingo's passengers. ‘All aboard, Ernest! Did you hear? Oh Ernest, Charlotte, it's happening at last!’ Ruth jumped up and down, waving her handkerchief in the air. ‘It's the moment we've been waiting for!’ There was no time for her cousins to answer. Still cheering, the passengers had started a mad rush towards the gangway, shoving and pushing at anything and anybody in the way. ‘Give passage to the women and children!’ someone shouted. ‘Make way there!’ Whoever he was, his words floated away unheeded. It was every man for himself and no concessions given. It was lucky for the Appleby family, Ruth thought, that they had Ernest, carrying Enoch on his back, to batter his way through. Enoch began to cry. He did not like the noise, and all these people pushing him. ‘It's all right, lad,’ Ernest said. ‘Stick tight hold, that's all.’ He turned his head to check on the others. ‘Keep together!’ he cried. ‘Whatever happens, keep together. And hold on to the bundles!’ ‘Easier said than done!’ Ruth yelled. ‘People get in the way. I can't keep up with you!’ Though she had fallen a little behind she managed to keep her cousins in sight. Then suddenly there was a strong wave of pressure from behind, as if all the world was at her back. She felt certain that she must fall on her face and be trampled underfoot. She was more frightened than she had ever been in her life, but fright gave her strength. She raised her arms, still managing to cling to her bundle, and lashed out. She was fighting for air and space — and then she lost her balance. Miraculously, she did not fall down. The crowd was so thick that she was carried along with it. But she was losing sight of her family. ‘Help! Ernest, help!’ She yelled at the top of her lungs, calling again and again until at last he heard her terrified  screams. With difficulty, he made his way towards her, Charlotte clinging to him for dear life. But at last they reached the top of the crowded gangway. Sailors waiting there hauled them roughly on to the ship, not caring how they landed. In front of Ruth an old woman, not moving quickly enough to please them, was thrown so heavily that she landed on her back on the deck and was too winded to rise. ‘Mind what you're doing!’ Ruth shouted angrily to the sailor. His reply was to give her a sharp pull forward and then a shove in the back, which knocked her to her knees. ‘You treat cargo better!’ she yelled furiously. He spat in her direction. ‘Cargo's valuable!’ he sneered. ‘For heaven's sake,’ Ernest begged, ‘don't waste time arguing, Ruth. We must get to our bunks or they'll be taken!’ ‘How can they be taken?’ Ruth said. ‘We have them booked and paid for. A bunk for each of us and one for the children to share.’ It was their first lesson of many, that what was promised and paid for bore little relation to what would be received. Ruth was horrified when they went below and she saw their sleeping space. ‘It can't be true!’ she cried. ‘One bunk six feet long and six feet wide for all of us? And one filthy, straw-filled mattress? I don't believe it!’ A sailor nearby — he was pushing people into the hold as if he was packing meat — called out to her. ‘You a single lady?’ ‘I am. Travelling with my family.’ ‘As well for you then. We usually puts the single ladies in to share bunks. With the men if they're lucky!’ He leered at her and she wanted to strike him. ‘Don't make a scene, Ruth,’ Ernest pleaded. ‘It'll not do any good. We must make the best of it.’ ‘Very well, Ernest.’ He was right, and she determined not to let the sleeping arrangements upset her. In any case, she would spend most of her time on deck. She was not to  know that, once at sea, they would only be allowed on deck at certain times, like dogs let out to exercise. ‘Never mind,’ she said, surveying the cramped space between the tiers of bunks, wondering if there was room to sit upright. ‘Never mind, it's not forever! And at least we've been lucky enough to get a bottom bunk.’ Charlotte was sitting dejectedly on the edge of the bunk, her face chalk white, her eyes closed. ‘I feel seasick already!’ she moaned. ‘Charlotte, you can't!’ Ruth said briskly. ‘We're still in the harbour. Come up on deck with me. You'll feel better for some fresh air.’ ‘I'd sooner lie down,’ Charlotte muttered. ‘I'll stay with her. You take Enoch,’ Ernest said. From the deck, Ruth looked out at Liverpool. It was the first city she had ever seen. She had set foot in Skipton and passed through Keighley, but these were small country towns. Only in books had she seen buildings as magnificent as those which rose up before her, and she had never, anywhere, seen so many people. The river, so wide that she would have mistaken it for the sea, was full of craft of all sizes, though most of them lay at anchor. ‘I wonder why that is?’ she said to Enoch. An answer came unexpectedly from a middle-aged man leaning on the rail nearby. At least she thought him middle-aged, but his voice wasn't and when she looked at him again she saw that under his haggard features and emaciated frame he was still young, perhaps in his late twenties. He spoke with a strong Irish accent, soon to be a familiar sound on board since most of the emigrants were Irish — and most of them as scrawny and hollow-cheeked as he was. ‘It's the wind which is contrary,’ the man told her. ‘Until it changes the ship will not sail.’ ‘Oh but the Flamingo sails on tomorrow morning's tide,’ Ruth informed him confidently. ‘Only if the wind allows,’ he said, smiling at her ignorance. ‘The power is truly in the wind.’ Ruth thanked him for his information and a few minutes  later he raised his hat and walked away. Enoch grew restless, so they walked around the deck until he decided that he had had enough and that only his mother would do. Ruth did not enjoy her first night on board. Modesty forbade her to undress properly and get into her nightshift in front of so many people, though it was so hot below decks that she felt obliged to take off her top skirt and her blouse. Also, she was acutely embarrassed at having to share her cousin's bed, especially as they would be squeezed so closely together in the small space. ‘How shall we arrange ourselves?’ she asked. ‘The baby by the wall. Ernest next to her,’ Charlotte said. ‘Then me, then Enoch — and you on the outside.’ ‘And what if the baby wants feeding?’ Ernest asked. ‘Then you can hand her over to me.’ It was impossible to stretch out, let alone toss and turn, as in her restlessness Ruth wanted to. She lay rigid, not allowing herself to move in case she should disturb the others. She was aware, though no-one spoke, that for much of the time Ernest and Charlotte were also awake. At one time she felt Charlotte turn towards her husband, and knew that they were in each other 's arms. There was plenty of sleep going on around her. The snoring rose and fell like an ill-tuned orchestra, interrupted by the curses of those who, like herself, could not sleep. The stuffiness in the hold was made worse by the acrid smell of unwashed bodies. Not far from her a man retched violently — thought whether from sickness, since they were scarcely moving, or from drunkenness, she did not know. Several babies cried, though Jane slept well. Ruth told herself that once they were at sea things would be better. Then towards morning, she fell asleep. When she wakened Ernest was already up and dressed. ‘A happy birthday to you!’ he said. She was eighteen years old. ‘The wind has changed,’ he told her. ‘It's blowing from the east now. They say that if it keeps up we shall sail on time.’ ‘And once we're at sea the food will be given out,’ Ruth said. ‘We haven't much left — and very little water.’ ‘Well then, if we want to say goodbye to the old country, we should go up on deck,’ Ernest suggested. Charlotte shook her head. ‘I'd sooner stay where I am. Anyway, someone has to look after our belongings else they might get pinched. It'll be dog eats dog on this voyage!’ In any case, she had no ties in England, no-one it grieved her to leave. And no matter what Ruth said, she did feel sick. She would like to go to sleep now and not wake up until they set foot in America. Nothing Ruth had ever imagined prepared her for the magnificence of that day's scene on the Mersey, though she saw most of it through a mist of tears. All the ships, large and small, which had been held up for days past, had now unfurled their sails and were putting to sea. As the Flamingo herself cast off and manoeuvred into position to sail down the broad river, a wild cheer went up from the emigrants on deck. She reckoned there must have been as many as four hundred of them. But she could not cheer. Instead of Liverpool, with its splendid buildings and famous docks, she saw, first Nordale, with the long sweep of the fells, and the river running through the valley, then her own moorland, clothed in purple heather. She saw it all as plainly as if it had been magically transported from Yorkshire and spread out on the quayside, the moors stretching away in the distance until they met the skyline. And then she saw the faces of her aunt and uncle, her father and her grandfather, Maria and Willie — everyone she had loved and still loved and must leave behind. And Dick's face was amongst them. There were not many signs of sadness on deck. A few old people watched with impassive faces, as though they no longer felt anything, but most of the people were in high spirits, talking and laughing. As the Flamingo moved down the river the wind began to fill the sails. A man struck up a tune on a concertina and those near him began to dance. Ernest put out a hand and touched Ruth's arm. ‘Don't fret, love! The best is yet to come,’ he said. But there were tears in his eyes too. In the weeks and days which followed Ruth clung to those words of Ernest's. And most of the passengers, she thought, must have relied on similar thoughts to see them through. By –passengers' she meant those who travelled steerage. It was said that the few cabin passengers on board sailed under very different conditions. ‘I doubt they are overcrowded,’ Ernest remarked. ‘Or short of food and water.’ ‘And I doubt they get such rough treatment from the crew,’ Ruth said angrily. ‘They wouldn't dare treat cabin passengers the way we're treated!’ She wondered if the cabin passengers caught the illnesses — especially dysentery — which were rife in the steerage. There was supposed to be a ship's doctor aboard but no-one below decks had set eyes on him. They had been afloat only a few hours when a seaman shouted down the hatch. ‘Everybody muster on deck for the roll call! Quick about it, I ain't got all day!’ There were cries of protest, for though the sea was not yet rough, many people were already sick, and unwilling to stir. ‘Those as don't muster for the roll call don't get no rations,’ the seaman shouted. ‘No roll call, no food — nor water neither!’ ‘Food is the last thing I'm interested in,’ Charlotte said. ‘I'd rather just stay here.’ ‘You can't do that, love,’ Ernest argued. ‘It's not just food, it's water as well. We can't afford to miss the water ration.’ Reluctantly she dragged herself out of the bunk and, with Ruth carrying the baby and Ernest holding on to Enoch, they went on deck. After the roll call the third mate, with two helpers, doled out the rations. ‘You're getting oatmeal, bread, potatoes, tea, ship's  biscuits and a piece of fat bacon,’ he shouted. ‘Three days'supply. You're a lucky lot and no mistake!’ It sounded well enough until they saw the size of the rations. ‘My youngest could manage that lot and he's only two!’ a man complained. ‘It's no good to a grown man!’ He was ignored. ‘Drinking water every day,’ the third mate shouted. ‘No expense spared!’ ‘What about water for cooking and washing?’ a woman asked. ‘There's plenty of sea water,’ he answered. ‘Ready salted, too.’ ‘Where's the fresh meat we were promised?’ a man standing near to Ruth called out. ‘The prospectus says fresh meat.’ The third mate glared at him. ‘Them that are lucky'll get fresh meat later on,’ he retorted. ‘Them that makes trouble'll get none.’ Then Ruth saw that he deliberately gave the man who had asked the question only half the bacon ration he was entitled to. ‘That's what happens to them as asks awkward questions,’ he said grimly. In this instance it mattered little. There were enough passengers ready to believe that they would never wish to eat again, let alone eat fat bacon. ‘Take mine, lad!’ ‘And mine!’ ‘And mine!’ Far more than the man had been denied was pressed upon him. ‘Good luck to you for speaking up!’ someone cried. ‘You'll be sorry for that, all of you,’ the seaman said. ‘When you get really hungry you'll be sorry you gave so much as a mouthful away.’ No-one believed him. He was trying to frighten them. After all, they had paid for their rations; they were entitled to them. Then, with food to be cooked, the rush for the stoves began. There were four stoves situated amidships; great monsters which spat out showers of sparks. ‘They terrify me!’ Ruth said. ‘Why, the sparks alone could set the whole ship alight. And how are we to get near? There must be more than fifty passengers to each stove.’ ‘Follow me!’ Ernest was determined. ‘I'll make a way through.’ Ruth had volunteered to cook the first meal. She made a little oatmeal porridge for Enoch, and for the three adults she cooked bacon and potatoes, in the iron pan they had brought from home, and used some of the water ration to make tea. ‘The bacon's none too fresh,’ she said. ‘But I'm hungry.’ ‘So am I,’ Ernest admitted. The two of them ate well, but Charlotte could not face the meal. ‘I'll just have a bit of bread and a mug of tea,’ she said. Ernest looked at her anxiously. ‘You'll have to do better than that, love. Remember you've got the baby to feed. You can't do wi' your milk drying up for want of nourishment.’ ‘I can't help it,’ she replied. ‘I can't eat.’ Ruth could hardly blame her. With the lack of air, the smells, the unrestrained vomiting of a woman in the top bunk (why had she ever thought they were lucky to get a bottom bunk?) it took real hunger and a strong stomach to face food. By the third day they were out into the Atlantic. It was then that the wind changed round to the north-west and the first, and worst, of the storms hit the Flamingo . The sea roared like a pride of hungry lions, thudding against the side of the ship like a thousand battering-rams, so that it seemed that at any moment it must break through and drown them all. Ruth tried not to show her terror when the timbers creaked and moaned like tormented spirits and she could hear the waves breaking on the deck above them. But as well as being frightened, she was angry. She could not bear the  thought that after all they had gone through, all they had sacrificed to get so far, it should end like this. Would they ever see America, or would they all end up at the bottom of the sea, food for the fishes? She had not known that weather like this existed. On the second day of the storm a seaman bellowed down the hatch. ‘No rations until the storm's over!’ ‘What about the water?’ someone called. ‘No water neither. Not until the storm bates!’ His words were lost in the frightened screams of the women, the crying of terrified children, the loud cursing and swearing — and sometimes praying — of the men. Ruth wanted, physically, to hit back at the storm– which went on and on, which was striking at her . At her worst, on the third night, faint from lack of food, her throat parched with thirst, she had a crazy idea that the storm was singling her out for punishment, was expending its venom to get at her. She hated it. She hated it as if it was a personal devil. She was no longer aware of the people around her, only of herself and the storm. At the height of her anger, unable to stop herself, she beat a loud tattoo with her clenched fists on the wooden edge of the bunk. ‘Stop it, damn you! Stop it!’ Her cries and thumps awakened both children, and when they started to cry, Charlotte screamed at her. ‘What do you think you're doing?’ ‘I'm sorry! It's the storm. It's driving me mad!’ ‘We all have to bear the storm,’ Charlotte cried. ‘Why is it any worse for you? Why do you all us have to be so special?’ Ernest tried to calm down both women. ‘Hush now. We must try to sleep if we can.’ Ruth came quickly to her senses. But there was no stopping Charlotte and Ruth realised, as the words poured out of her, that she was releasing the pent-up feelings of many months. ‘I won't hush!’ she shouted, turning on Ernest. ‘Tell her  to hush! Why is she allus right and me allus wrong? Ruth this, Ruth that, Ruth says, Ruth thinks. You should have married her. You should have kept her i' the family. Alleys rotten, stinking, Appleby family! You got her into our bed, so why not? Perhaps you'd like her to change places wi' me, so as you can give her a cuddle in the night?’ Ernest clapped a hand over her mouth. ‘Stop it!’ he commanded. ‘You're talking nonsense.’ Ruth struggled out of the bunk and, wrapping herself in her shawl, she lay on the floor. She was already dressed, they all were, in preparation for the shipwreck which they felt sure must come. For the moment she was so shocked by Charlotte's naked, sexual jealousy that she forgot to be frightened by the storm. From now on, though she knew of nowhere else where she could sleep, she resolved never to share her cousin's berth again. And as far as possible she would keep her distance from Ernest. She was unaware of any undue familiarity between herself and her cousin; they seemed as they had always seemed since childhood. But she would take no chances. But what of the future, she thought, Alas there on the floor? It was clear that she wasn't wanted by Charlotte, and if Ernest did want her with them, then that would only make matters worse. She felt totally and truly alone. And when the woman in the top bunk threw up again and the sour vomit splashed down on her and soaked her skirt, it was the last straw. She buried her face in her hands and burst into bitter tears. She had to get out. No matter how bad the storm was she had to go on deck, where at least the air was clean. But because of the storm the hatches had been battened down and no matter how hard she searched she could not find a way out of the hold. But she did find an unoccupied corner of the floor, away from everyone she knew. There she stayed until morning. Soon after dawn the storm suddenly abated. Ruth was there waiting when the hatches were raised and she escaped at once and went up on deck. Although, officially, steerage  passengers were only allowed there at certain times, no-one took any notice if a few people walked the deck. Curiously, there were very few who availed themselves of this privilege. The stench which rose from below, to where Ruth stood at the top of the hatchway, was worse than anything she could ever have imagined. Dysentery among the passengers continued and during the storm almost everyone had been sick, so that with the lack of sanitation the steerage was truly awash. And then the smell did something that the worst fury of the storm had failed to do. Ruth felt her stomach heave, and rushed to the side of the ship, where she was violently sick over the rail. When it was over she raised her head and breathed in deeply. The air up here was clean and fresh. The wind had, by comparison, almost dropped, and the March sun made a path of gold across the water. Had it not been for splintered wood and debris Alas on deck, and a ripped sail or two, the storm might have seemed no more than a bad dream. She was standing by the ship's rail, thinking about Charlotte's outburst, worrying about what she should do, when she heard a woman speaking to her. ‘I asked, are you all right?’ the woman said. She was standing by a part of the deck which jutted out above the place where Ruth stood, by which Ruth knew that the woman was a cabin passenger. No-one from the steerage was allowed up there. ‘All right?’ ‘Yes. How have you weathered the storm? Was it awful down there?’ ‘It was,’ Ruth said. ‘It was terrible. But I'm all right— which is more than can be said for some.’ ‘I wanted to come down. Before the storm, I mean, to see if there was anything I could do. Neither the captain nor my husband would let me. They said it wasn't fit.’ ‘It isn't,’ Ruth agreed. ‘There are four hundred people down there. It isn't fit for them.’ The woman flushed, though Ruth hadn't meant to rebuke her. ‘I've seen you on deck with your husband and little boy,’ she said. ‘Are they well?’ ‘Quite well, thank you — though he's my cousin, not my husband, and the child is his. His wife suffers badly from seasickness and keeps mostly to her berth.’ ‘Poor soul,’ the woman said. Then: ‘I have a little girl on board. I must go to her now. Perhaps I shall see you again — and please tell me if there is anything I can do.’ After that, since she now spent as much time as possible on deck keeping out of the way of her cousins, with whom she felt a constraint, Ruth saw the woman for several days in a row. Once or twice Ruth took Enoch with her and on one occasion the woman on the upper deck was accompanied by a little girl. ‘This is my daughter, Anna,’ she said. The child was about five years old, fair-haired, immaculately dressed, and seemingly friendly. ‘Would you like a sweetmeat, little boy?’ she called out to Enoch — and threw one down to him. ‘How are things going,’ the woman asked. ‘Badly. Our rations have been cut again,’ Ruth said. ‘We're receiving no fresh meat at all, and not enough water. Also, there's a great deal of sickness for which we need medicines. I know the ship is supposed to carry a doctor, but he doesn't come near us. I dare say he's afraid to, for fear of catching something!’ ‘What can I do?’ the woman asked. ‘Well for a start, madam, you could tell the captain. I feel sure he must already know, since it's his ship, but it might be good for him to realise that persons of influence, like yourself, who might report him, also knew. He won't care about any of us, of course.’ For two days after their conversation Ruth did not see the woman, and then on the third day a man leaned over from the upper deck and called out to her. ‘Are you the young woman my wife, Mrs Carson, knows?’ he asked. ‘You answer her description.’ 'I expect so,’ Ruth answered. ‘I don't know the lady's  name and I haven't seen her these last two days. I hope she's well.’ ‘She is not well,’ he said. ‘She has a chill and is confined to bed. So is our daughter. I have been sent to ask you whether, if I can arrange it with the captain, you would consent to look after them. My wife is travelling without a maid or nurse and I am of little use in a sickroom.’ ‘I would be pleased to help if I could,’ Ruth replied. ‘Then come back to this same place in an hour's time, when I shall have spoken with the captain.’ Ruth hurried back to the berth, gave Ernest and Charlotte the news, and began to make herself as tidy as she could. ‘It might be interesting,’ she said. ‘At any rate it will help to pass the time.’ And it will get me out of your way, she thought. ‘Who knows,’ Ernest said, ‘perhaps they'll have a bit of food to spare. If you could get something to tempt Charlotte…’ ‘I'll try my best,’ Ruth promised. Charlotte had her mind on other things. ‘There's a baby four berths along, ill with a high fever. Enoch was playing with the other children in the family only yesterday. What if it's something bad? What if it spreads? What if Enoch and the baby take it?’ Her voice was hoarse with anxiety. ‘Don't fret, love. I daresay it's no more than a chill. They'll be all right.’ Ernest tried to comfort his wife, but Ruth saw the anxiety in his eyes. She went back on deck at the appointed time and within a minute the man appeared. ‘Would you come up here?’ he called out. ‘I'll take you to my wife's cabin.’ Their quarters turned out to be a small suite, with two sleeping cabins and a minute dining-room. Mrs Carson, Alas in a bunk with a blanket thrown over her, was clearly relieved to see Ruth. ‘Anna and I are much better,’ she said. ‘Especially Anna. But I have told her all the stories and rhymes I know and she is getting bored. Also, I should dearly love to rest. Could you come for a few hours each day, do you think?’ For the next few days Ruth spent most of her waking hours with Anna, reading to her from the small collection of books Mrs Carson had brought on board, playing games, making up stories. From the first she took her meals with Anna. Food was plentiful and there was as much water to drink as she wanted. At the end of the first day Ruth presented herself to Mrs Carson. ‘If you please, ma'am…?’ ‘What is it, Ruth? Is Anna misbehaving?’ ‘Not at all, ma'am. We get on well together. It's just…’ She hesitated. ‘Well?’ ‘Well ma'am, there's some scraps of food left over and…it's bold of me to say so…but if it was going to be wasted I know my cousins would feel the benefit. They've cut our rations again. But only if it was going begging of course!’ ‘Why, Ruth, of course you may take it!’ Mrs Carson exclaimed. ‘You may take whatever is left over at the end of each day. I am quite distressed to think of your family going hungry!’ So for three days Ruth took food, and sometimes water, to her cousins, and since the food was of a better variety, Charlotte was tempted into eating. ‘And you will have my rations, since I don't need them,’ Ruth told Ernest. He shook his head. ‘They've stopped your rations. They reckon you're not due, since you're eating with your employers.’ On the fourth morning of their arrangement Ruth presented herself to Mrs Carson as usual— but to a troubled looking lady. ‘I'm afraid our little arrangement must come to an end, Ruth,’ she said at once. Ruth could hardly believe it. ‘But why, ma'am? Have I not given satisfaction?’ ‘Most certainly you have,’ Mrs Carson answered. ‘I am more than pleased with you. But the captain has informed me that there is a case of smallpox in the steerage. A baby, poor little mite. It would not be safe to have you going to and fro between the steerage and our quarters. You do see that, don't you?’ Ruth felt sick at heart. It was bad enough having to sleep in the steerage — lying on the floor wherever she could find a place, where cockroaches and rats could run over her while she slept. To go back to spending her days there was unendurable. There must be some way out of it! ‘Would it be possible…’ she began. ‘Yes?’ ‘I mean, if I didn't go back to steerage? If I never went back until the end of the voyage, could I stay with Miss Anna? Look after her all the time? And you too! There are lots of things I could do for you, ma'am. I'm good with my needle.’ Heaven help her if that lie were put to the test! ‘I wouldn't want payment, and I'd sleep on the floor — anywhere!’ Mrs Carson looked at her husband. ‘I'm fit and well,’ Ruth told them eagerly. ‘The doctor could examine me if you wished.’ ‘You do realise,’ Mrs Carson said, ‘that you would not be able to see your cousins at all until we reached New York? Not even if they were ill. Especially not if they were ill.’ ‘I don't think they'd miss me,’ Ruth confessed. ‘In fact the arrangement might be a relief to them — except for the extra food.’ Which would in any case, cease, she thought, if she could no longer work for the Carsons. ‘Well, if you're quite sure,’ Mrs Carson said. ‘But I should not want you to go back there at all, not until we are ready to disembark. And from this very moment. I should require you to send a note to your cousins by one of the crew. He could bring back those of your possessions you will need for the rest of the voyage.’ Charlotte, Ruth thought as she penned the note, would be delighted. And though Ernest might not be so pleased, it  would make matters easier for him. Enoch would miss her most, and she him. So she joined the Carson household and settled with them. The days passed happily enough but at night, in the tiny cabin she shared with Anna, she sometimes lay awake and thought of her cousins, down below in that hell-hole. And she knew that if she had been made welcome from the start, she would still want to be with them, in spite of this comparative luxury. If she could have been part of a warm, loving family, it was what she would have liked most of all. But she was not wanted and knew she never would be. It had been a mistake ever to force herself upon them. ‘Mr Carson's father has a prosperous cotton business in Manchester,’ Mrs Carson said one day in her friendly manner. ‘My husband is going to New York to make new contacts. I know I shall enjoy our time there. They say there is most interesting society, with lots of concerts and plays and cultural pursuits. And of course there is a great deal of money to be made.’ Ruth drew a deep breath, summoned all her courage, and blurted out the question which had been churning in her mind day and night for some time. ‘Could I go to New York with you, ma'am? Could I work for you? I would do any job you wished, and to the very best of my ability, if only you'd give me the chance.’ She felt herself growing hot at her own temerity, but Mrs Carson showed very little surprise. ‘I've been expecting you to ask me that question,’ she admitted. ‘But surely you wish to go to Wisconsin with your cousins? And would it not be much wiser, for your sake, to do so?’ Ruth told her something of the situation between herself and her cousins. ‘But Mr Carson and I are only in New York for a year,’ Mrs Carson pointed out. ‘What would you do at the end of that time?’ ‘Something will turn up,’ Ruth said with confidence. ‘And if it doesn't, I promise I will join my cousins. Things  might be better between us after an absence. You will not need to have me on your conscience.’ ‘I must confess,’ Mrs Carson smiled, ‘that I would like to keep you with us. I have said as much to Mr Carson. If you were not to accompany us I would have to find someone in New York. It would be pleasant to have an English girl and Anna is already fond of you.’ ‘And I of her,’ Ruth said. So it was arranged. At breakfast on the day before they were due to arrive in New York Mrs Carson said, ‘I think you could go below and see your cousins today. The doctor tells me that the danger of smallpox is now past.’ More than one person had died, and been buried at sea, but it was the funeral of the baby who was berthed near to her cousins which affected Ruth most. Not only was it the first death, but it could easily have been little Enoch, or Jane. The ship's carpenter had sewn the tiny body into canvas, weighting it at the feet with coal, so that it would sink rapidly. Everyone on board who was free to do so had attended the funeral, Ruth standing with the Carsons on the upper deck. A porthole was opened amidships and on a plank lay the small body. The captain read the funeral service and the first mate raised the plank and tipped the small bundle into the water. It floated for a second and then sank. Ruth thought she would never forget the bereaved mother's demented scream. ‘Tell your cousins what you have decided,’ Mrs Carson said. ‘See if they approve.’ When Ruth went down to the lower deck it was a hive of activity, with the strangest thing she had so far seen taking place. Men, women, and all except the smallest children, were on their hands and knees, busily washing every inch of the deck, supervised by the third mate and half a dozen rough-looking sailors, who kept them at it every second. She found Ernest and Charlotte on their knees with the rest, with Enoch, as far as a three-year-old could, keeping an eye on the baby nearby. ‘What in the world is happening?’ Ruth enquired. ‘You may well ask,’ Ernest replied bitterly. ‘Of course you wouldn't know, would you,’ Charlotte said with asperity. ‘Now that you're a cabin passenger.’ ‘What is it?’ Ruth persisted. ‘The steerage passengers have been ordered to scrub every bit of the deck so that it's clean for the quarantine inspection,’ Ernest explained. ‘There's been more water used on this floor than we've had to wash ourselves and our clothes in since we left Liverpool!’ ‘I'm sorry,’ Ruth said. ‘That's terrible. And I would willingly get down and help you, but Mrs Carson is waiting for me.’ ‘We don't need your help,’ Charlotte retorted quickly. Ernest sat back on his heels. ‘Anyhow, we're about finished,’ he said more reasonably. Charlotte stood up, drying her hands on her skirt. Ruth was dismayed to see how thin she had grown. Both she and Ernest had lost weight during the voyage, but Charlotte could ill spare it. Ruth told them her news. ‘You've done mighty well for yourself, I must say!’ Charlotte remarked. ‘But you don't want me with you, Charlotte! You never did. Admit it!’ Charlotte refused to answer, but Ruth knew she was right. Ernest was torn two ways. ‘I daresay thou'll be all right. I wouldn't let you do it else. But we shall miss thee, Ruth; Charlotte, as well as me and the children. So promise thou'll come to us when the year is up. Promise!’ Ruth's eyes met his. If you only knew how much I long to come with you now, she thought. But there was nothing to be said. ‘I promise I'll consider it,’ she told him. ‘And remember, I shall send my share of the Emigrant Society's dues every quarter out of my wages. You must let me do that or I can't think of rejoining you.’ When Ruth wakened on the morning of May the tenth  her first thought was that this, God willing, was the day they would sail into New York harbour. She wakened Anna and dressed her and the two of them went on deck. The lower deck, shining clean now, was thronged with steerage passengers. They had somehow spruced themselves up, dressed in whatever was their best, collected their belongings together, and now waited to go forward into their new lives. The man with the concertina, whom Ruth had noticed on the day they sailed from Liverpool, struck up a tune; only this time it was not a dance, but a hymn of thanksgiving and praise, in which everyone joined. ‘All people that on earth do dwell, Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice…’ The sound grew and swelled, as the singers somehow found new strength to praise their God, until the ship was filled with their harmonies. Ruth, looking down from the upper deck, her hand clasped around Anna's, lifted her clear soprano voice with the rest, though it was difficult to sing because of the tight aching in her throat and the tears which pricked at her eyes. She caught sight of Ernest and Charlotte in the crowd and at the same time they saw her. When they waved to her, and held up little Enoch to see her better, she could no longer keep back the blinding tears. She saw the scene in front of her through a mist. The ship was sailing into the harbour now. It looked quite different from Liverpool, and not only because the sun was shining. There were scores of boats and ships of every kind, with a forest of masts and rigging outlined against the clear blue sky. A cacophony of ships'sirens filled the air. The sun shone over everything, sparkling on the water, and what with that and her own tears it seemed to Ruth that the sea was scattered with diamonds. In spite of her grief at being parted from her cousins, she could not help but feel excited. There was something in the air, an energy, a vibrancy, which she had never experienced before. It filled her, lifted her spirits, and she remembered Ernest's words, and said them out loud to the little girl beside her. ‘The best is yet to be, Anna! The best is yet to be!’ Her words were carried away on the breeze, to join the tumult of sounds. She felt sure and confident that they were true. Mr and Mrs Carson joined them. ‘I am afraid we shall not see your cousins when we disembark, Ruth,’ Mrs Carson said. ‘The steerage passengers must go through quarantine, which I'm afraid will delay them considerably. For cabin passengers, of course, it is not necessary.’"
FIC FIC-G01-003 4.49 "42 You could have been forgiven for imagining, that Peter Nicholson had undergone surgery to replace his vocal chords with a megaphone. His words boomed out, spoken with clarity and in a tone that suggested that he was keeping his words simple for the less intelligent inmates of the prison. On either side of him the warders  looked down onto the other landings, watching for any signs of unrest amongst those below. Warders on each of the individual landings also ensured that silence prevailed as he spoke. ‘As you may have heard,’ the Governor said, smoothing his hair back with one hand, ‘Whitely has been in the news lately. The media are obviously hard up for stories because they seem interested in what they refer to as our overcrowding problems here. Also, the local MP has taken it upon himself to look personally into what goes on in this prison.’ Robinson looked at Porter and raised his eyebrows quizzically. ‘To that end,’ Nicholson continued, ‘a Home Office delegation will be visiting this prison tomorrow to see how it runs and to see how well you're all cared for.’ He smiled sardonically. A murmur rose that was quickly silenced. Nicholson paused for a moment theatrically. ‘The members of this delegation will be speaking to a number of prisoners. Asking about conditions, etcetera.’ He looked around the upturned faces. ‘You may speak to them if you wish. Help them with their questions. You may have some questions for them . If you have any problems or grievances, you're quite free to tell them.’ ‘Yeah,’ murmured Porter. ‘And get our fucking heads busted by the screws when they've gone.’ Swain took a step towards him, shooting him a warning glance. ‘If any of you have any problems, at any time, you know you are free to speak to the officers in charge of your landing or to me personally,’ Nicholson continued. There was another babble of chatter, and this time it took longer to quieten. Nicholson looked around once more. His green eyes, like chips of emerald, caught the light and reflected it coldly. He brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve as he waited for the silence he required. Finally satisfied, he continued. ‘I want this prison running perfectly for these visitors,’ he said. ‘I want co-operation between you and the officers. I want the cells spotless. I want them to be impressed by what they see. I don't like people meddling in the way I run this prison and that's what they're doing. Meddling. I want them to leave here, knowing that this prison is well run and that its inmates are being adequately dealt with. I don't expect them to leave here with a catalogue of stories about what a terrible place Whitely is. As I said, you may speak to them if you wish. That is your prerogative. But bear in mind that if they hear too many bad reports, they'll disrupt the way I run this prison. And I don't like disruptions. I hope that's understood.’ He looked around him, then smoothed his hair back once more. ‘That's all.’ Nicholson and his officers turned and moved away from the landing rail, out of sight of the other prisoners. On all the landings the inmates were allowed back inside their cells. ‘Breakfast in twenty minutes, get a move on,’ said Warder Swain, slamming the door shut behind Robinson and Porter. ‘Suck this,’ rasped Porter, holding his penis in one fist. ‘Fucking cunt.’ Both men started to dress, taking it in turns to wash as best they could in the small sink perched on the cell wall. ‘I wonder if anyone will be stupid enough to tell this bunch of do-gooders the truth?’ Robinson mused, drying his face. ‘Are you joking?’ Porter muttered, fastening his grey  overall. ‘Even the screws wouldn't tell them anything. They're more frightened of Nicholson than most of the cons in here.’ Robinson nodded in agreement. ‘A tour of the prison, eh?’ he said, smiling. ‘I wonder what they'll make of our humble little home.’ ‘Probably want to move in with us,’ Porter quipped. He crossed to his locker and took out a comb, running it through his short black hair. The inside of the locker was a mosaic of photos: naked women, a team picture of Liverpool FC and a couple of postcards all vied for attention. He blew a kiss to one of the women, then closed the locker again. Robinson was sitting on the edge of the upper bunk. ‘I'll tell you one thing, Rod,’ he said, ‘and I'll bet money on it. There's at least one part of this nick they won't see. Nicholson will make sure of that.’"
FIC FIC-G01-011 3.74 "50 It was smaller than a man's thumb nail and Nicholson held it between the thumb and finger of his right hand with surprising delicacy. The microchip was square and the entire complex structure was encased in smooth plastic. Nicholson laid it on a piece of black velvet that lay on the work top, allowing his visitors to get a better look at the tiny object. ‘Is this some kind of joke?’ Fairham asked. ‘Why should it be?’ the Governor asked irritably. ‘You promised to show us a way of relieving overcrowding. Is this meant to be it ?’ ‘The idea was first perfected in America. A number of states are already using it,’ Nicholson declared. ‘But that didn't work,’ said Fairham. ‘Ours is a different system. The microchip is inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle of the prisoner's leg.’ He looked at Fairham with scorn. ‘The calf muscle, to keep it simple.’ He held the other's gaze for a moment then continued. ‘The operation takes less than fifteen minutes. It's carried out under local anaesthetic, there is no pain to the prisoner. No side effects.’ ‘What does it do?’ Clinton asked, his eyes fixed on the tiny square. ‘Once inside the prisoner's leg it gives off something called a Synch-pulse,’ Nicholson said. ‘A tiny electrical charge which in turn produces a signal that can be picked  up by monitoring equipment here at the prison. It's like a tracking device.’ ‘What range has it got?’ Merrick asked. ‘Fifteen miles at the moment,’ the Governor told him. ‘The modifications that are being made to it will probably increase that range by anything up to thirty miles.’ ‘And what is the object exactly, Mr Nicholson?’ Anne Hopper enquired, looking at the Governor. ‘An end to overcrowding, Miss Hopper,’ he said. ‘The thing you all seem so concerned about.’ ‘How the hell can that,’ Fairham jabbed a finger towards the microchip, ‘help with overcrowding?’ ‘The device is placed in the leg of certain remand prisoners,’ Nicholson explained. ‘They can then be released from Whitely and monitored on our electronic equipment here. We know where they are twenty-four hours a day.’ ‘And what if they move outside the range of the tracking device?’ Clinton murmured, his eyes still fixed on the device. ‘We don't allow that to happen,’ Nicholson said. ‘The prisoners are picked for the operation according to the severity of their crime. Everything is explained to them, including the fact that if they do travel beyond the range of the device they'll be re-arrested and prosecuted for attempted escape. They usually co-operate. It's in their own interests to do so. Many of them prefer this to being stuck inside for twenty-three hours a day. Some are even working while they're on the outside waiting for their trials.’ ‘Do I detect a note of compassion in your attitude, Mr Nicholson?’ said Fairham, contemptuously. ‘You actually sound as if you care about what happens to the men who undergo this operation.’ ‘It gets them out of my hair, Mr Fairham,’ the Governor said. ‘It means that my officers have fewer prisoners to deal with.’ ‘How many men has this been tried on so far?’ Clinton enquired. ‘Ten,’ Nicholson said. ‘And all of them have been successful.’ ‘And what is your definition of success, Mr Nicholson?’ Anne Hopper wanted to know. He looked at her impassively. ‘Not one of them tried to escape,’ he said. ‘They all reported to the police station they'd been assigned to and they all went on to stand trial.’ ‘When is the device removed?’ Clinton asked. ‘As soon as the trial is over.’ Clinton stood back and nodded, looking at the microchip then at Nicholson. ‘Well, I must say I'm impressed, Mr Nicholson,’ said the MP. ‘Me too,’ Merrick echoed. ‘It seems a great step forward.’ Fairham merely prodded the device with one index finger. ‘Who does the operations?’ he wanted to know. ‘There are a number of doctors involved,’ Nicholson told him. ‘None resident at the prison.’ ‘That's a pity,’ Anne Hopper intoned. ‘It would have been interesting to meet them.’ ‘The work is still in its infancy, Miss Hopper. They're not too anxious to be put in the limelight just yet,’ Nicholson told her. ‘Why? In case something goes wrong?’ Fairham said, challengingly. ‘As I said, the work is still relatively new. Until it's completely perfected we'd rather keep it quiet,’ the Governor said, glaring once again at the other man. ‘I can understand that,’ Clinton said, smiling. ‘It seems to be successful though, Mr Nicholson. Full marks to you. We'll be reporting this as very satisfactory progress when we return to Whitehall.’ ‘Satisfactory?’ Fairham snapped. ‘This man is using remand prisoners as human guinea pigs and you call that satisfactory?’ ‘I think you're being a little over-dramatic, Mr Fairham,’ Clinton said, smiling patronisingly. ‘It is preferable to the alternative of being locked up twenty-three hours out of twenty-four,’ Merrick echoed. Nicholson smiled triumphantly at Fairham. ‘What is your view, Miss Hopper?’ the Governor wanted to know. The woman shrugged slightly. ‘I suppose I would have to agree with Mr Clinton and Mr Merrick,’ she said. ‘As long as the patients are volunteers and the risks are explained to them before the operation, I can see no objection myself.’ ‘You appear to be out-voted again, Mr Fairham,’ Nicholson said, smiling. ‘I'd like to know a little more about the actual mechanics of the project,’ Clinton said. ‘How the tracking devices are built, what the operation entails, how the prisoners are monitored. That kind of thing. I will have to make a report to the House, you understand?’ Nicholson nodded, his ingratiating smile spreading. ‘Certainly. If you'd like to come back to my office we can discuss it there,’ he said, looking at Fairham. The other man was flushed with anger. The Governor turned to lead the small procession out. ‘We've only seen a small part of the hospital wing,’ Fairham observed. ‘I'd like to inspect the facilities here before we leave.’ Nicholson retained his air of calm. ‘Of course,’ he said, leading them towards a door at one end of the room. It opened out into the infirmary: There were half a dozen prisoners in the beds; other men in white overalls moved among them, performing their duties. One was mopping the floor, another dispensing pills. A third man was pushing a trolley, collecting dirty laundry. Patients and workers alike gave the Governor and his visitors only cursory glances. More lingering looks were reserved for Anne Hopper. A warder stood at one end of the infirmary, standing by a thick metal door. Nicholson looked towards him, hoping that none of the visitors noticed the look of apprehension on his face. He stood back as the visitors moved among the men, speaking to them where possible, usually meeting with only perfunctory grunts in answer to their questions. The Governor caught the eye of the warder at the far end of the infirmary and the man nodded almost imperceptibly. A silent answer to an unasked question. The Governor licked his lips, aware that they were once more dry. Come on, hurry up and get out of here. One by one the visitors returned to join him. They're not going to ask. Fairham looked to the far end of the infirmary. ‘What's through there?’ he asked, pointing at the door. ‘The morgue,’ Nicholson said quickly. ‘It's where we keep any prisoners who die until they've been identified, or until arrangements can be made for their burial.’ Fairham nodded slowly. Come on, come on . ‘I think we've seen enough now, Mr Nicholson,’ Clinton said. Fairham was still gazing at the door. The Governor licked his lips again. ‘We'll go back to my office, then,’ he said. At last Fairham tore his gaze away and filed out in front of Nicholson. The Governor glanced back at the solitary warder and nodded. As he walked out he let out a sigh of relief. He would return here as soon as the delegation was gone. For now, at least, it was still safe."
FIC FIC-G01-019 6.23 "58 The shutters were still closed, the door firmly locked. It would be another two hours before Les Gourmets opened for business. Inside the restaurant the tables were bare but for cloths, all immaculately clean. The staff wouldn't arrive to set them for a while yet. Out in the kitchen preparations were already taking place in readiness for the lunch-time trade. The restaurant always did well at lunch-times, situated as it was in Shepherd Market. It was one of five such establishments owned by Ray Plummer. Now he sat at one of the tables, cradling a glass of white wine in one hand. With the other he gently stroked his hair. There were five other men with him. They too had drinks. Plummer put down his glass and reached into his inside pocket for the monogrammed cigarette case. He took one and lit it, looking round at his companions. ‘Same voice as the other night, Ray?’ said John Hitch, flicking his long blond hair over his shoulders. Plummer nodded. ‘And I still couldn't pin the bastard down,’ he complained. ‘He says the shipment's coming in by boat?’ Terry Morton said. ‘The Sandhopper , it's called,’ Plummer told him. He repeated the other details about the shipment of cocaine, as relayed to him by the mysterious informant the previous night. He sat back when he'd finished and sipped his wine. ‘Could it be a set up?’ Joe Perry wanted to know. Perry was a thick-set, bull-necked man who looked as if he'd been eased into his suit with a shoe-horn. The material stretched so tightly across his shoulder blades it threatened to rip. His face was smooth, almost feminine; it looked as if it had never felt the touch of a razor. Plummer shrugged. ‘It could be,’ he said. ‘It could also be bollocks, couldn't it?’ Morton interjected. ‘I mean, there might not even be a shipment of coke.’ ‘Then why bother phoning?’ asked Adrian McCann, rubbing a hand over his close-cropped hair. Over his ears it was completely shaved. ‘It's a bit fucking elaborate, isn't it?’ ‘That's what I said,’ Plummer agreed. He turned to Hitch. ‘You heard the geezer the other night, John; he didn't sound like he was joking, did he?’ Hitch shook his head. ‘I agree with Joe,’ he added. ‘It could be a set-up.’ ‘But by who?’ Plummer wanted to know, a note of exasperation in his voice. ‘We know it's not another organisation in London, especially not Ralph Connelly's firm.’ ‘Could it be somebody working for Connelly with an axe to grind?’ asked Martin Bates, running his finger around the rim of his glass. Bates was in his early twenties, one of Plummer's youngest employees. Plummer shrugged. ‘Who knows? The point is, do we go with it or not? Do we assume there is a shipment? And, if there is, do we knock it over?’ ‘Are you asking for votes, boss?’ Hitch said, laughing. The other men laughed too. Plummer didn't see the  joke and glanced irritably at Hitch, waiting until they calmed down. ‘Right, let's assume there is a shipment of coke,’ he continued. ‘Let's say that phone call was kosher. The day after next the shipment is meant to be arriving,if the information's right. If it is right then the coke is hidden among a load of coffee beans. Now the question is, if this is a set-up, we're going to get hit when we try to take the lorry they're transferring the shit to. How do we get round that ?’ ‘Take out the lorry first?’ offered Joe Perry. ‘No,’ Hitch said, smiling. ‘We hit it before they even take it off the boat.’ Even Plummer smiled. ‘Hijack the fucking boat,’ Hitch continued. ‘Unload it somewhere else down the river. We have our own lorry waiting. Unload it, pack it away and piss off.’ Plummer slapped him on the shoulder. ‘That's what we'll do,’ he said. ‘Take the shipment while it's still on the river.’ ‘Like pirates,’ chuckled Morton. The other men laughed. ‘Ray, there are some other things to consider,’ offered McCann. ‘Once we've hit Connelly's shipment, he ain't going to be too happy.’ ‘I wouldn't be if I'd just lost twenty million,’ Plummer said humourlessly. ‘What are you getting at? You reckon he might come looking for bother?’ ‘Wouldn't you?’ McCann said. ‘He's right, Ray,’ Hitch interjected. ‘A fucking gang war is the last thing we want.’ ‘What am I, stupid?’ Plummer said. ‘There's no need for Connelly to know who turned him over. If it's done properly, and I'm not talking about fucking balaclavas and funny accents, there's no reason why he should know  who hit him.’ He looked at Hitch. ‘I'm leaving that side of it to you, John. Like I said, you got about thirty-six hours.’ Hitch nodded. ‘If the worst comes to the worst and he does find out, what then?’ Perry wanted to know. ‘A gang war would be as damaging to Connelly as it would to us. He won't want it,’ Plummer said with assurance. ‘But if he does , he can't win. We're stronger and, for twenty million, I'm bloody sure we're going to be better equipped. Connelly will realise that. He's not stupid.’ ‘So we go with it, then?’ Hitch echoed. Plummer nodded. He reached across and touched Hitch's arm. ‘John, I want Jim Scott to drive one of the cars,’ he said quietly. Hitch looked puzzled. ‘Scott? He runs one of your clubs, doesn't he? I wouldn't have thought he was the right bloke for this kind of operation,’ Hitch said. ‘I want him involved,’ Plummer said, his eyes never leaving Hitch. ‘He knows how to handle himself. He'll be all right.’ ‘I'm sure he will. I just don't know why you want him in on it.’ ‘I've got my reasons,’ Plummer said. Hitch shrugged. ‘I'm sure you have,’ he said. ‘Okay, I'll tell him. If you want him in, that's fair enough, Ray. You're the boss.’ Plummer smiled. ‘Yeah, I am .’"
FIC FIC-G01-026 5.45 "65 Why? The word kept rolling around in his mind like a marble. Why? Jim Scott looked at his reflection in the mirror, studying his features. Why did they need him for this job? He sighed. Plummer had insisted that he be involved. Why? Why? Fucking why? He slammed his hand down on the top of the dressing table, causing some of the bottles to topple over. An aftershave bottle spilled its contents and Scott inhaled the aroma momentarily before stepping back. He crossed to his bed and sat down. Outside the wind was blowing strongly again, wailing around the block of flats. He heard footsteps passing his door as someone made their way home. There was a thumping noise coming from above that was a record player. He got to his feet, staring up at the ceiling, wondering whether or not he should shout to the owner to turn the volume down. Better still, go up there and tell him. Scott finally decided to do neither. He wandered out into the kitchen and took a pint of milk from the fridge, supping straight from the bottle. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and walked back into the bedroom. Why? Why did they want him on this particular job? Why couldn't he get in touch with Carol? Why hadn't she been in to work? Why hadn't she called him? Fucking why? He slammed the milk bottle down on top of the bedside cabinet, pulling the drawer open. He reached in and took out the Beretta, cradling it in his hand, working the slide. He held the piece up and sighted it, squeezing the trigger, allowing the hammer to fall on an empty chamber. Finally he lowered the weapon and dropped it onto the bed beside him, then fumbled in the drawer again for the box of ammunition. He began feeding 9mm shells into the magazine. She could hear him moving about in the sitting room. Carol Jackson rolled onto her back and gazed at the ceiling, aware of the movement from the adjacent room and also of the perspiration that sheathed her body. She ran a finger through the glistening moisture, allowing her hand to trail lower, through her pubic hairs. She felt the wetness of Plummer's semen as it trickled from her. Carol sighed and reached for a tissue from the bedside table. Plummer called through and asked if she wanted a drink. She called back that she didn't. For some reason her thoughts turned to Scott. He must be wondering where she was by now. She hadn't been to work for two nights. Carol could imagine his state of mind. Had he finally realised there was someone else? If so, what was going through his mind? She closed her eyes and swallowed hard. If only she'd had the courage to tell him she wanted to end their relationship when the cracks had first started to appear. He would have been disappointed. Upset. Perhaps even angry. But now she feared what he might do. Would he really try to kill her? She wished she could convince herself that what he'd said had merely been an idle threat. But she knew him too well. There was no avoiding the issue any more. Either he would find out she was seeing Plummer or she would have to tell him. It was only a matter of time before the truth emerged. And then? She exhaled deeply. Plummer would look after her, wouldn't he? After all, he was her lover. Carol almost smiled. Lover . The word implied some kind of emotional bond and that, she knew, they didn't have. But he thought a lot of her; he seemed to want her around. If she could move in with him. The prospect of escaping her job and her flat suddenly seemed to lift her spirits and the threat of Scott was momentarily shrouded. Move in. He'd never mentioned it to her and she had not even thought about it until now, but therein lay her escape. Both from Scott and from her lifestyle. Carol sat up, resting her back against the padded headboard. She wasn't escaping. She was running, running from herself as much as her surroundings. She wanted to move in with Plummer, though. Even loveless comfort was preferable to what she had. She called to Plummer to come back to bed but he didn't answer. Twenty million pounds. He concentrated on the figure, held it in his mind, savouring it as a wine expert savours a fine vintage. Twenty million fucking pounds. Hitch had arranged details of the job and Plummer felt safe enough with him dealing with it. He hated having to trust anyone, but Hitch was one of the few he did. Plummer poured himself another drink, pulled his monogrammed housecoat more tightly around him and paced the sitting room slowly, glancing around at the expensive furnishings and ornaments which filled the flat. Carol called him again and he called back that he wouldn't be long. He told her to go to sleep. Pain in the arse . He smiled and sipped his drink, glancing across at the phone as he refilled his glass. There had been no more calls since the informant had rung with the news of the cocaine shipment. Plummer licked his lips and frowned. Who the hell was the informant? He'd wondered countless times, ever since that first call it had played on his mind. Set-up? Wind-up? They'd soon know. If it was a member of Connelly's gang it made no sense, yet who else would know about the shipment? It made no fucking sense at all, but Plummer had his reasons for believing the information. Twenty million reasons. Carol called to him again. He smiled and headed for the bedroom."
FIC FIC-H9D-009 4.59 "WALTER MACHIN'S DAUGHTER The inquest was hardly more than a formality, the verdict an inevitability. The coroner had not got where he was by thinking, and he showed no inclination to start on this occasion. If the police said they were satisfied that the death was accidental, that was good enough for him, and should be good enough for the jury. It was. The due processes having been gone through, there was nothing to prevent Hilda Machin being buried according to the rites of the Christian church whose doings she had cared remarkably little about during her lifetime. Greg was extremely interested to see whether Viola Machin would be represented in the flesh or the flower at the interment, and he got permission from his Principal to take the morning off and attend. ‘You were good to the old thing during her lifetime,’ he said, ‘so you may as well trot along. It's all local history, isn't it? Oswaldston's going to be living off Walter Machin for a few years.’ As it turned out, the Machins were there in force, solemn in the church, gloomy by the graveside. It was a chilly May day, with grey skies and a wind which seemed thirsty for another death. Viola Machin, nevertheless, seemed impervious to it: she stood in bosomy grief, in a becoming coat of umber shade, dabbing her eyes at the pathetic bits of the service; Desmond, in a heavy black coat, managed only an insurance agent's decorous grief; and Hilary looked as if cheerfulness might keep breaking  through — which would probably, after all, be what Hilda would have liked most. Rose seemed still to be genuinely upset. She had lost a good deal of her bloom and bounce, and looked as if the sentiments of the burial service kept stabbing her to the heart. Her husband, Bill Clough, seemed awkward and unsure of himself: his suit fitted badly, and he looked like a comic who has unwisely accepted a serious part in provincial rep. He continually looked around him, as if for advice, then dropped his eyes to his shoes. There was another relative from Hilda's side of the family with a feeble grasp on life and reality, who kept muttering remarks like ‘To think she should be the first to go,’ and ‘Well, who would have thought it?’ At the end of the ceremony she tottered off to the bus, looking as if she had every intention of popping in to the local when she got home and livening everyone up with a steady dropping of ‘To think our ‘Ilda should go before me’ remarks. When it was over Viola swept up to Rose, took her impulsively by the hand and murmured words of comfort. Rose showed signs of both anger and tears, and Viola swept on ahead towards the churchyard gate to avoid such an embarrassment. Desmond, after the briefest of mutters, hurried after her to tuck her into the car. Hilary lingered, and managed to seize on a moment when Bill Clough was talking to Greg to exchange his low words with Rose. It was odd, but Greg noticed Bill Clough's eyes following them sharply: he was saying nothing to the purpose so there was no reason why he shouldn't watch them, but Greg, following his lead, did wonder whether Hilary's mutterings were not of a rather different kind from Desmond's. More what? To the purpose? More personal, perhaps? At the gate of the churchyard Rose turned to Greg. ‘Would you like to come home for a drink? I didn't want to ask the others, because they were nothing to Mam. But she was fond of you — she'd like to think of us having a drink on her.’ ‘Thanks very much,’ said Greg. ‘I think I could manage a quick one.’ Local history, he said to himself. Bill Clough bumbled around them, telling his wife she mustn't catch cold, and Greg had the notion that Rose's invitation had not been welcome. He stepped out the short distance to the Clough home with added determination. They were met at the front door by a delirious spaniel, who clearly had no idea of funeral decorum, and they proceeded into the front room, where Bill Clough switched on a bulging orangey imitation-coal electric fire, and then went to a horrible drinks cabinet — all plastic and flashing lights. The room seemed to speak nothing of Rose and everything of Bill — or was that, Greg wondered, just his own biased assumption? Rose went to fetch ice and tonic water from the kitchen. ‘What'll you have, then?’ asked Bill heartily, and then, with his odd alternations of mood on him: ‘What'll it be?’quite mournfully, and looking bewildered at the array of bottles. ‘A Scotch, please — plenty of soda,’ said Greg, and settled down with it into the sofa. ‘I must say I'd have been happier,’ said Rose, when everyone was suited and they had all sunk into their chairs, ‘if Viola had kept away. If I'd thought of it I'd have sent her a message: You won't be welcome.’ ‘Eh — that wouldn't be on, Rose,’ said her husband. ‘You couldn't have done that.’ ‘I could have, and all,’ said Rose. ‘Or Hilary could have kept her away.’ Greg saw Bill Clough blink agitatedly and look sharply at his wife. She paid no attention to him. ‘Everybody knows the two of them had an almighty row that evening,’ she went on. ‘If Mam was upset that night it was Viola's doing. She should have had the decency to keep away. I nearly choked when she came up afterwards.’ ‘What did she say?’ asked Greg. ‘I miss her every moment of the day,’’ quoted Rose, imitating Viola's genteel contralto tones. ‘I know just  how you must be feeling.’ Condescending old bitch.’ ‘Of course, she probably does miss her,’ said Greg, to be fair. ‘Old people miss their old opponents — they've nothing to fight any longer.’ ‘If what I hear is true she's sharpening her claws on her daughter-in-law these days,’ said Rose. Her husband, looking hard at his glass, said: ‘You ought to keep on the right side of her, any road. There's the question of the money from the books.’ ‘Hmm,’ said Rose doubtfully. ‘Well, I have to admit that there she hasn't behaved too badly. We are sharing the royalties — the same arrangement she and Mam came to. That Desmond came round — she sent him — and he discussed it with me. Right cheesed off about it he seemed, too. That's probably why she sent him — she knew it would cut him to the quick. That's a nasty piece of goods.’ ‘You think he's out for what he can get?’ ‘I'm sure of it. Everyone knows that. He doesn't try to hide it. That's why he's not doing so well at the moment: people like you to put up some pretence that you're interested in something other than money, even if you are in the insurance business. It doesn't occur to him to.’ ‘Appen he wants to get his hands on the money from your dad's books,’ said Bill Clough, looking around him with eager interest, as if he had made a discovery. ‘Of course he wants to get his hands on it,’ sighed Rose, not bothering to look at him. ‘But he won't as long as Viola is alive. And he hasn't the least idea of how much it will come to. I could tell that from the way he was fishing around — he got that panting, thirsty. expression on his face. He does, you know, when money is in question.’ ‘Did you tell him anything?’ asked Greg. ‘Not on your life. I'm not fond of Viola, but I wouldn't wan her murdered in her bed. He'd do it for ten quid, let alone for this little lot.’ ‘I didn't know you knew him so well,’ said Bill Clough. ‘I've heard all about him,’ said Rose. ‘Anyway, you don't know yourself what they'll bring in, do you, Rose, so you couldn't have told him anything?’ said her husband after a pause, when his pathetic, bewildered-puppy air had intensified. ‘Don't I ever,’ said Rose, with her old energy. ‘I talked to Mam before she died. They've sold American rights in both of the novels, film rights in The Factory Whistle and they're being translated into quite a few foreign languages. Viola and I will get several thousand each- and it'll go on.’ ‘you never told me this,’ said Bill plaintively. ‘Didn't I?’ said Rose, not as if it had slipped her mind, but as if he had. ‘Still,’ she went on, ‘we shouldn't be talking about money.’ She leaned over to Greg. ‘I want to thank you for all you did for Mam. I never worried about her this last year, you know, because I knew you dropped in and kept an eye on her. It's meant a lot to me, and I know it did to her.’ Greg was once more conscious of Bill Clough's eye on him — watchful, anxious, distrustful. What's he afraid of, he wondered? What's he got against me? He said: ‘I failed her, really, at the end. I was only down there at the Spinners’, but I didn't get to her in time.’ ‘You couldn't have known. Nobody could,’ said Rose. She sat hunched in thought. ‘Ee, it's nobody's fault,’ said Bill Clough, falsely cheerful. ‘And she had a good life, when all's said.’ ‘She had a hard life,’ said Rose sharply, not looking at him. ‘It's no joke being left with a young child to bring up on your own. It wasn't then, specially.’ ‘How did it come about?’ asked Greg, neatly insinuating his toe into the opening. ‘Was it by mutual agreement? Had the marriage been breaking up before the war?’ ‘According to Mam, Viola went and grabbed him as soon as he was demobbed,’ said Rose, smiling a little at the memory of Hilda's version. ‘Manhandled him into her bed.’ ‘But there must have been something before that…?’ ‘I suppose so. One thing Mam said suggested it had been going on for some time… Years.’ ‘What was that?’ Rose continued looking down at her glass. ‘I'd rather not say… But, of course, Dad had had all sorts of minor affairs and that hadn't broken up the marriage. Mam knew as well as anyone that he wasn't naturally monogamous. ‘I'll bet Viola made sure that he was,’ said her husband, with feeling. ‘Of course Mam said he never was the same after he married Viola. She would, naturally. He certainly never wrote anything more, so she was right to that extent. And there's stories around the town…’ ‘What sort of stories?’ asked Greg. ‘About her nagging, spying — you can guess. I'm not bothered about it myself. I hardly remember him, and I think what he did to our Mam was foul. Just when we were expecting him home — to phone and tell her like that. But I expect that was Viola's doing…’ ‘Some men are weak,’ said Bill Clough sagely. ‘I wonder how your mother could ever have come to live with Viola,’ said Greg. ‘Oh well — it was convenient, that was all. They met up because of the papers. Viola said she was going to sell the house, because it was too big for her (Hilary had just moved out), and she found the stairs difficult — so what was she to do with Walter's manuscripts and stuff, which were legally Mam's? Mam was just about to be rehoused by the council, and didn't fancy being so far out of town. So they moved in together. It was convenient, as I say… Also, I think Mam kind of fancied the idea… It was odd, sort of exciting.’ ‘Yes, that figures,’ said Greg. ‘That's what I thought must have made her do it.’ ‘You make your mam sound a right oddity,’ protested Bill Clough. Rose ignored him. ‘She'd been a bit bored,’ she said. ‘She'd had the odd little — well, not affair, exactly, but romance. But it wasn't anything much, because you had to be discreet in those days, specially if you had a child. It wasn't like now.’ Her husband's gooseberry eyes shot in her direction, then looked at Greg, who lowered his noticing eyes to his knees and thus looked, if he could have seen himself, the picture of guilt. ‘Then I'd moved out, when I had a job with a doctor in Blackburn, and she was very bored, I think. Moving in with Viola gave life a bit of spice, a bit of danger. Well, not danger, of course, but you know what I mean.’ ‘Oh yes, I know,’ said Greg. ‘She'd have hated being in one of those old people's flats, and they're miles from the centre. She was a quarter of an hour away from us here, but still, from Viola's you can practically see this place. It made her feel more in touch.’ ‘Oh, can you see Meadowbanks from here?’ asked Greg innocently. ‘Did you see the fire? That must have been awful.’ ‘Oh no, I didn't see it. I didn't know anything till the police rang. You can't actually see the house quite. And I was in all the evening.’ ‘Not quite all evening,’ said her husband. ‘You took the dog out, remember. As usual.’ The words seemed weighed carefully. ‘Oh yes,’ said Rose. ‘I took Sally for a walk. But I didn't notice any smoke.’ But at the word ‘walk’ Sally had started putting up a tremendous performance, and the party broke up. On the way back to the College Greg said to himself: That husband of hers is all het up about something. He's watching like a cat by a mousehole. He suspects something. And if those glances at me meant what they looked like, it could be plain old-fashioned sex. Or was there something else as well? In the corridor of the College of Further Education Greg passed his Principal, who caught a whiff of his breath, and said: ‘Funny thing: local history's the only subject I know that always seems to involve alcohol. Stick with it, Hocking my lad.’"
FIC FIC-H9D-012 4.1 "POSSIBILITIES There is something in the motion of a train stimulating to sleep or thought. Being disinclined to sleep, Greg sat in the second-class compartment of the train returning him to Manchester, alone apart from a commercial traveller who seemed miraculously disinclined for conversation, and tried to think the case through. He had now been through, albeit superficially, the Walter Machin papers. So far as he knew, everything that had been transcribed had been lodged with Jackson's, in copy. If that was so, it was difficult to believe that anyone started the fire with a view to destroying some secret in the papers. It was too late for that, and nothing discreditable had leapt out from Greg's perusal. The clue to the crime, if crime there was, must be in the human beings themselves, and in their relationships with each other. On any reasonable assessment of motive and opportunity, Viola Machin must surely stand high. She had recently quarrelled with Hilda, who was the only person who stood in the way of Viola imposing her own version of people and events on posterity. And to an old person, ‘setting the record straight’, or straight as they saw it, could be very important. The two of them — as far as was known — were alone in the house. There was also the possibility of sexual jealousy, going way back, but Greg had thought that over a lot, and still did not feel inclined to take the possibility seriously. As far as he could see, Viola Machin's marriage had followed a familiar pattern: begun  from sheer sexual passion, aggravated by loneliness and perhaps desertion, it had quickly gone sour; it sounded as if Viola had suffered disillusion and frustration — the sexual side had not proved enough, and other aspirations, social ones perhaps, or aspirations of Walter making a mark in the literary world, had not been fulfilled. This pattern, clear enough at the time, had been obscured by the revival of Walter Machin's reputation, and Viola's desire to rewrite history, to have her marriage accepted as perfect, if tragically brief. But sexual jealousy of an unsatisfactory husband's former wife — this didn't seem likely: Viola's own love-life, Greg guessed, had been varied enough for her to ignore any previous entanglements of her second husband's. Hilda, for her, simply represented another point of view, which she did not want to get a hearing. About the opportunity, Greg was less than happy: if the fire, designed to cover up the murder (which it so successfully had), was started in the attic, could Viola have done it? With difficulty, perhaps — slowly and heavily. But surely it would have been both noisy and dangerous? The financial motive was looking stronger all the time. Those books represented money — a lot of money. If the agreement between Viola and Hilda was to hold — as apparently it had held after the murder-then Rose was the principal beneficiary. Also interested in Rose's financial position would be her husband and — if his suspicions were correct — Hilary Seymour-Strachey. How much did these people know about the likely profitability of the books? Rose, he had discovered, knew quite a lot— because Hilda had told her. The others, presumably, would have known just as much as she cared to tell them. Financially, the elder son of Viola, and his wife, seemed the best bet, if character were taken into account, too. They seemed to love money, want it, need it. Yet the fact was, they had not benefited by the death, nor would they necessarily do so. Now if it had been Viola that had  died… An interesting thought… If it had been Viola. And then there was another interesting thought: if it had been Viola as well. As it very easily might have been. Would Desmond Seymour-Strachey have honoured any agreement his mother had come to with Hilda, would he have considered himself obliged to pay half the royalties to Rose? Opportunity for these suspects was difficult to determine — so much more difficult because this was not an official investigation, and he was not a regular investigator. How did one ask someone what they were doing on the night of the twenty-eighth if one was pretending to be engaged in merely casual conversation? Rose, he knew, had had an opportunity — her dog-walking provided her with that. Her absence (if it was regular and fairly lengthy) would presumably have given a similar opportunity to her husband. But as far as the others were concerned he hadn't a clue, and, rack his brains as he might, he had very little idea how he could find out. For the rest, there were two figures on the margin of the investigation. Kronweiser would most certainly never have burnt the papers, even to cover up murder. But what if he had taken advantage of an accidental blaze to kill Hilda? Perfectly possible, if he was on the spot. But why should he want to? There was no motive, and Greg had no notion whether he was around the house at the time or not. If so, he had certainly been working later than usual. Just thinking for a moment of character alone: who would he pick as murderer? Mentally he grouped them. Possible murderers: Viola Machin, Desmond Seymour-Strachey, Mr Kronweiser. Unlikely murderers: Rose Clough, Bill Clough. Impossible to say: Margaret, Hilary and Gerald Seymour-Strachey. Even as he grouped them, he shook his head: what did he really know about these people? Why did he think Rose unlikely? Because she seemed a nice woman and had had a nice mother, with whom she seemed to get on well. It was  ludicrously nebulous. In fact he knew nothing of importance about her at all. And what, then, was there left for him to do? The background, certainly, still needed some filling out. He wanted to finish reading the works of Walter Machin that were available, perhaps have a good look at Gerald Seymour-Strachey's autobiography and other writings, talk to people who knew Machin — grilling senior citizens in pubs, as he put it to himself: filling them with weak beer to stimulate their weaker memories. It was all necessary, no doubt, but with all the optimism of his youth he couldn't see that it looked promising. And after that? Somehow — somehow — to find out who was where on the night of Hilda Machin's death. And suddenly it struck Greg that there was something else of possible interest. There was Walter Machin's will. Greg had rung Helen from London to tell her when he would be arriving in Manchester, and she had promised to work late and go out with him for a meal. Her office was only ten minutes from Manchester Victoria, and Greg decided to step it out through the grey, grubby streets, in the foggy chill of a May evening. He was just turning into the featureless modern office block that housed the Heyes-Farringdon Company where Helen worked, when his eye was suddenly caught by a sign on the other side of the street: The Olivera Typewriter Company. He stopped in his tracks, scanned the window opposite for some minutes, then turned to walk into the building much more slowly and thoughtfully than before. ‘That Olivera office opposite,’ he said to Helen as he walked into the office —‘what sort of place is it?’ ‘That,’ said Helen, ‘is a fine greeting for a girl.’ ‘That Olivera office opposite,’ said Greg, coming up to her desk, sitting himself on the edge of it, and kissing her twice —‘what sort of place is it?’ ‘That,’ said Helen, very coolly indeed, ‘— and I don't think two very perfunctory kisses make things very much better — is an office-supply place. You've heard of Olivera typewriters, for heaven's sake. They supply those — and filing cabinets and desks and desk chairs and all that sort of thing. Bulk orders mostly, to big firms. It's the central Olivera place in Manchester.’ ‘Not the sort of place you'd go to to pick up a new ribbon?’ ‘I shouldn't think so — not unless you wanted a dirty look from the sales staff.’ ‘Was that the place ‘you saw Kronweiser going into?’ ‘Yes, that's right. I told you.’ ‘You just said office place. I thought you meant a kind of stationers’. What could Kronweiser want at a place like that, do you think?’ ‘Well, I suppose you could go there for a new typewriter, though as I say, they're mainly interested in bulk orders. Perhaps they're cheaper here than in the States.’ ‘Hmm — well, perhaps. It doesn't sound likely. Kronweiser's gone. I heard the other day. Back home to finish his great work of rehabilitation. I suppose he could have had one sent to the plane to get it duty-free. How would I find out?’ ‘Well,’ said Helen, ‘I do know a girl who works in the outer office there, and we do sometimes meet up for lunch and I could try to put her on to it… On the other hand, I am a girl who likes a bit of old-fashioned interest taken in her, and I do get cheesed when I have to take second place, especially when it's to a dead widow of seventy-odd…’ For the rest of the evening, Greg showed interest. ‘Are you alone?’ asked Helen, when she phoned through the next afternoon to the College of Further Education staff common room during Greg's free period. ‘No,’ said Greg, looking towards an elderly female colleague in a drab woolly frock, hunched over piles of  marking but twitching at the ears for anything of scandalous human interest. ‘Can I help you at all?’ ‘Well, I took my friend from Olivera's to lunch, which will cost you a couple of quid or a night out at the weekend. She promised to find out, and she's just come back with the results. Now — he came in there with a letter.’ ‘I see,’ said Greg greyly. ‘Was it any particular date?’ ‘Yes — that was the point. It was dated nineteen thirty-nine, and it was about a visit to London.’ ‘Ah yes,’ said Greg. ‘As a matter of fact, I think I may have seen it.’ ‘Well, he had the original, and he wanted to know if the machine it was typed on was available before nineteen thirty-nine.’ It was with difficulty that Greg restrained himself from saying ‘What!’, but knowing that his colleague would assume that he was being told he was about to become an unmarried father, and spread it, he said in the same world-weary voice: ‘That's very interesting.’ ‘Well, they investigated, and apparently it was quite easy, because it was a very distinctive typeface, which they'd only used on one machine. He came back a day or two later and they told him it definitely had been available before nineteen thirty-nine.’ ‘Had?’ ‘Yes. The machine was only on sale between nineteen thirty-six and nineteen forty. He seemed satisfied, said he was grateful, and it was what he had hoped.’ ‘I see,’ said Greg. Then, unable to frame any neutral question to follow up, he just said, ‘Thank you for the information, hope to see you soon,’ and put down the phone. For the rest of his duty period he walked around in a daze. The information, at first, had seemed to open up new vistas. Mr Kronweiser had been on to something. He had suspected someone of forging letters from Walter  Machin. Was that it? Who then? Hilda Machin, presumably. Or perhaps the two old dears together. To keep his interest up. But it sounded more like Hilda alone — it was just the sort of thing to appeal to Hilda's sense of humour. To feed Mr Kronweiser false letters and die of laughter as he lapped them up. Probably she had some old typing paper of Walter's still around in the attic, so she could make them look convincing. It was just like Hilda — and she could tell herself she was giving the Walter Machin industry a boost while she was enjoying a good laugh. Kronweiser had got on to it and — what? Killed her? No, that was nonsense. Not just because it was a ridiculously inadequate motive, but because it wasn't true. The typewriter wasn't a later model than ‘thirty-nine. Kronweiser hadn't proved forgery. Then — what? It was a dead end. For Kronweiser as for him. Kronweiser's suspicions were set at rest, and he had gone back to the States. As for Greg-he was precisely where he had been before. Or was he missing the point? Was that not the reason behind Kronweiser's enquiry at Olivera's? And if it was not, what in the wide world was it? He racked his brains till he finished teaching, and he racked them while he tried to sleep, but nothing presented itself. He had a dreadful feeling that the next step would have to be the old-age pensioners."
NWS NWS-A7Y-003 7.51 "Law Report. Parliament urged to think again on housing issue:. Queen's Bench Divisional Court Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council v Bujok Before Lord Justice Watkins and Mr Justice Hutchison November 2 1989 IF a dwelling house is in such a state of disrepair as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance, the tenant may lay an information against his landlord alleging the existence of a statutory nuisance under the Public Health Act 1936. The tenant is not obliged to ensure that the landlord is aware of the defects in the premises or to give the landlord an opportunity to remedy the defects before commencing legal proceedings. Although that is the position in law, the court emphasised that as a matter of commonsense a tenant should first complain to the landlord before exercising the right to prosecute. The facts. Mrs Bujok and her family occupied a house as council tenants. In September 1988 Mrs Bujok laid an information against the council alleging the existence and continuance of a statutory nuisance under section 92(1) of the Public Health Act 1936. It was alleged that the council, being the owners of the premises, were the persons by whose act, default or sufferance the nuisance arose. Prior to laying the information Mrs Bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises. The justices held Mrs Bujok was not required to ensure that the council were aware of the defective state of the property prior to laying the information. The council appealed by case stated. The legislation. Section 92(1) of the 1936 Act defines ‘statutory nuisances’ as ‘any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance’. The decision. Mr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance. Action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work. If the person in default fails to comply with an abatement notice the local authority is obliged to make a complaint to the magistrates. If the complaint is proved, a nuisance order is made requiring the defendant to get the necessary work done. Effectively the sequence is that the person in default is told what is wrong and is required to put it right. He is given an opportunity to do so, and if he does not, he is subject to sanctions by the court to compel him to do so. The problem arises in connection with section 99 which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaint. Need he serve an abatement notice? The authorities plainly establish that he need not and cannot do so. Does that mean he may lay an information and bring the matter before the magistrates without first putting the person alleged to be in default on notice of what is alleged? The council argued that a landlord, particularly one such as a local authority, cannot realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenants. For Mrs Bujok it was argued that the 1936 Act was designed to secure in the interests of the community at large that statutory nuisances did not exist. It was submitted that an owner cannot turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting, he knows the property will in the course of time deteriorate. He must therefore satisfy himself on a regular basis that it does not constitute a statutory nuisance. In Warner v Lambeth London Borough Council (1985) 15 HLR 45, 50, Lord Justice Glidewell said a private person could lay an information alleging the failure to abate a statutory nuisance without first giving notice requiring abatement. Therefore in the present case the justices came to the correct conclusion. His Lordship reached that decision without enthusiasm because it seemed that as a matter of common sense, notice should be given in such circumstances before criminal proceedings were launched. Lord Justice Watkins said he agreed with reluctance. It was surely repugnant to commonsense that in this area of legal activity a local authority should be prosecuted by one of its tenants without first being given the opportunity by that tenant to remedy the consequences of a neglect to repair the dwelling that the tenant occupied. In law there was no doubt that Mrs Bujok was entitled to commence proceedings without giving notice of the state of the dwelling to the council. But in every other conceivable way that action was entirely wrong. Endless trouble to many people in courts and council offices and much money could be saved by the giving of notice of disrepair. If the council did not react to that notice, then would be the time for the tenant to exercise the right to prosecute. Parliament should give fresh thought to enacting a provision placing an obligation upon a council tenant to give notice to the council before being permitted to commence proceedings.

NWS NWS-A8R-002 7.8 "Prototyping is crucial to systems development, argues Ian Richards Tailored to fit. IN SYSTEMS development nothing is more fundamental than assessing user requirements. If you don't know what the system is required to do; you don't know anything. But many system developers are unable to assess requirements properly. They seem to think that you can ask a businessman what his requirements are and get an answer that amounts to a draft system specification. A doctor doesn't ask his patient what treatment to prescribe. The patient can explain only what the problem is. It is the doctor that provides the remedy. If you ask a user what sort of system he wants you will be met with a blank look. A user may have a deep knowledge of business problems, but knowing little about computers, has no idea how they should be tackled. Yet, analysts are heard asking time and again, ‘Tell me what you want. We've gone away from the days of systems imposed by the data processing department, this is going to be a system for the users.’ But of course the users don't know what they want, so they end up getting another duff system. An effective analyst provides the same service to the business as the doctor provides to the patient. He finds out what the needs of the business are, and prescribes the cure. The user tells the analyst what the problems are, and the analyst decides, at least in broad terms, what the user requires. But the analyst has one great advantage over the doctor. Once the user becomes familiar with the proposed system, helpful comments come thick and fast. ‘Oh, this will be of great help in ordering raw materials, but sometimes we get part deliveries, could we have an extra facility to deal with those? And sometimes non-standard discount is given, a pig to deal with on the old system, but if you could add one extra input box on that screen there… And what about orders not delivered on time? If we could list those we'd have advance warning of shortage problems on the assembly lines two months before they occur. Now that would be a great leap forward.’ Unfortunately you cannot reach this stage until you have developed a prototype system. And you can't develop a prototype system because the users haven't got a clue what they want. Most of them are probably muttering, ‘I'm too busy to get involved in this sort of thing. What's wrong with the old system anyway?’ The only way to develop a prototype is for the analyst to get inside the head of the user and, thinking like a user, decide what sort of system is required. Of course, the initial system will not be perfect. The analyst cannot hope to understand the business as well in a few weeks as the user does after many years. But once the user sees the system, channels of communication will open. Instead of persuading the user to specify requirements, the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needs. Good system development goes through two distinct phases. Initially the analyst does all the work, leading the user towards a system he thinks is right for the business. But once the user sees the potential of the system, a change in attitude takes place. The process becomes demand driven by the user. The analyst is then forced on the defensive, explaining why new features cannot be included because they are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive. Traditionally, systems were validated by users agreeing functional specifications. In theory, validation meant that the user had read the specification, imagined how the system would work in practice, and agreed the design. It was only when using a ‘test’ version of the system (available just before the planned implementation date) that difficulties would come to light, and a host of change requests be issued. The advent of fourth generation languages (4GLs) has made system development much easier. With a 4GL an initial prototype can be put together quickly. This means feedback is obtained early in the development process, and the system can grow around the user's requirements. Crucial to the development process is the relationship built up between the analyst and the user. The best systems arise when both have a deep understanding of each other 's jobs. Many developers use business analysts to ensure that the development team maintain a proper focus on business requirements. But this can be counter-productive, as it cuts off communication between the systems analyst and the user. Too much specialisation is bad for systems development; it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs. If you should stroll into a pub and meet an analyst and a user talking about work, and you cannot tell one from the other, they have probably developed a successful system together.

NWS NWS-A8U-003 6.25 "Adjusting the Delors vision of a Social Charter to the needs of greater Europe Notebook. By Edited by Alex Brummer THE main focus of British angst at the Strasbourg Summit is likely to be the Social Charter. But it is also plain that despite sterling's depreciation to a rate at which it might be reasonably competitive within the Exchange Rate Mechanism, Mrs Thatcher's team are no more ready to sign on the dotted line than they were in Madrid this summer. The Strasbourg smokescreen will be different. The Whitehall-propagated view is that the changes in Eastern Europe are so momentous they render European Monetary Union, a common fiscal policy and the charter obsolete. Instead of focusing on the narrow agenda of Delors the new Europe should be more forward looking. It should examine the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe and issues of global importance in Europe — such as pollution — rather than pussyfooting with the Social Charter. As far as the charter is concerned they may be on the right track (if for the wrong reasons). Although the aims of the charter are laudable, ensuring adequate social security, the right of employees to join a union and the right to strike, among other things, they could be unworkable if one assumes that some closer links between the emerging countries of the Eastern bloc and the West — including German reunification. One obvious problem, pointed out in the most recent issue of the National Institute Economic Review, is the issue of relative labour costs. A charter which encouraged the poorer countries to move towards the best practice in the richer nations would clearly affect competitiveness in the less well-off states. If this already were true in traditional free market economies, imagine the gap to be closed with countries emerging from the iron hand of Stalinist control. It would be clearly better for the UK, given its dismal failure on the inflation front, to be exposed to the discipline of the ERM irrespective of developments further to the East. But when it comes to the Social Charter there may well be a case for slowing the grandiose Delors ideas. Stateside bolt-hole?. TIMING was not on the side of Thames Television yesterday as it unveiled the £57million purchase of American TV production house Reeves. Fresh in the market's mind was the shambles which has engulfed TVS following its expensive foray into the American television market. The purchase of MTM is likely to wipe out the second-half profits of TVS this year. Thames is also choosing to launch the transatlantic venture — its first major takeover — as all eyes are focused on the British market where the Government will today reveal the details of its new broadcasting legislation including proposals to force ITV contractors to compete in an auction for the renewal of their franchises. Shares in Thames slipped on fears that the company may not be able to shake off the jinx which has dogged so many American acquisitions by British foragers. But chairman Sir Ian Trethowan described it as a ‘cost effective’ way into the US market which will add the adolescent delights of sitcoms such as‘Gimme a Break’to Thames's programme library. The company is also hoping to exploit the link to pump its own programmes out to the thousands of mainstream and cable stations in America. Plunging into the midst of a soft US market may not look clever in the short term, particularly since Thames's own revenue is starting to feel the effects of the slowdown in advertising spending. But America is still the largest television market and Thames now has a foothold. If disaster strikes and the company is outbid by one of the many expected rivals for its lucrative London franchise — the largest in Britain — Reeves could provide a bolt-hole. Law's delay. THERE is a growing belief in Parliament and among the hapless investors of Barlow Clowes that the Ombudsman's report into the Department of Trade and Industry's role in the affair will, in part, be suppressed on sub judice grounds. The legal fall-out of the £190million scandal and the criminal cases which have resulted from it mean that, on grounds of fairness alone, it would not be right to pre-judge the trials due to start next year. Sir Anthony Barrowclough's report could, indeed, be viewed in those terms and holding back some of the more sensitive parts would be consistent with the Serious Fraud Office's efforts to restrain some of the most recent civil court hearings on the affair. However, the SFO's handling of its investigations has hardly been consistent and it already has set a precedent for the Barrowclough report to be published in full. The best case in point is the publication of the DTI report into the Blue Arrow affair which came before the arrest and subsequent charging of the 11 defendants. It is no wonder, therefore, that many people believe the current delay in publishing the Barrowclough investigation is for reasons of political expediency rather than legalistic necessity. The crux of the matter is whether compensation should be paid to the investors: if Sir Anthony has thus decided, then the Government should duly oblige. In these days of financial sweeteners, surely there are more votes in rescuing 18,000, mainly elderly, investors from dire financial plight just as there is ensuring that the UK's last home-grown car manufacturer remains in British hands?

NWS NWS-A98-001 7.07 "Good sense and justice sought in immigration issue:. Queen's Bench Division Regina v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Rafique Before Mr Justice Simon Brown December 7 1989 WHEN a man applies to come to the United Kingdom to marry a woman settled here, it is not necessary for him to be able to state specifically whether he intends to settle in this country forever or whether he wishes to marry and return to his own country. If an applicant is uncertain as to his plans after marriage, the entry clearance officer should treat it as an application for settlement, and consider whether all the requirements for settlement are satisfied. The facts. Abid Hussain, a Pakistani, is engaged to be married to Miss Rafique, a British citizen, and they want to be married in England. Mr Hussain was refused entry clearance to come to England, mainly because he could not say what were his long term intentions. When interviewed Mr Hussain said he had not decided whether, following marriage, he, or his fiancee, would wish to remain in England or return to Pakistan. The entry clearance officer (ECO) said he was not satisfied that the primary purpose of Mr Hussain's intended marriage was not to obtain admittance to the UK. Mr Hussain appealed. The adjudicator concluded that Mr Hussain's application was for a short-term stay and dismissed the appeal after hearing evidence from Miss Rafique that she had no intention of living in Pakistan. The immigration appeal tribunal said the onus was on an applicant to bring himself within the specific immigration rule, and if he was unable or unwilling to do so he could not expect to succeed. Mr Hussain appealed. The Rules. Rule 41 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 169) provides: ‘A man seeking to enter the UK for marriage to a woman settled here and who intends to settle here thereafter’ will be refused entry clearance unless the ECO is satisfied that it is not the primary purpose of the marriage to obtain admission to the UK. Under rule 17 a man may apply for entry clearance to the UK for marriage where he and his wife will leave the UK after the marriage. The decision. Mr Justice Simon Brown said that shortly before the tribunal came to its decision in this case a tribunal chaired by Professor Jackson took a different approach in a similar case, Syed Jabar Hussain Shah. That tribunal said that to force an applicant to state whether he intends to live here forever, or for a period of not less than six months, invites deceit and was somewhat removed from reality. That tribunal said that where there was uncertainty as to the duration of the stay it was proper to consider the application as if ordinary residence was contemplated. Mr Justice Simon Brown said he greatly preferred the approach adopted by Professor Jackson's tribunal. It accorded with good sense and justice, and also properly reflected the important impact of the House of Lords' decision in Shah v Barnet Borough Council [1983]2 AC 309 upon the statutory definition of settlement for Immigration Act purposes. In Shah's case Lord Scarman said, ‘All that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does [eg, for education, employment, health, family or merely love of the place]has a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled’. Why should an applicant, who must in any event be prepared to satisfy the primary purpose test, be worse off because he contemplates the possibility of a relatively short stay in the UK than one who had the fixed intention of permanent UK residence? It was logical to construe the phrase ‘intending to settle’ in rule 41 differently from the contrasting phrase ‘admitted for settlement’which appears elsewhere. There was no possible good reason why rule 41 should not encompass those genuinely undecided as to their long term ambitions. Accordingly the tribunal in Mr Hussain's case fell into error. They categorised all applicants, genuine or otherwise, who were unable or unwilling to specify their long term intentions, as necessarily falling outside the ambit of the rules and thus doomed to inevitable failure when applying for entry clearance. The essence of what Mr Hussain said was that following the marriage he would remain in England on a settled basis as a married man for just so long as his wife dictated. And for good measure, it should be noted that the ECO long ago expressed his own conclusion that settlement in the UK was the intention in this case. The tribunal's decision was quashed and the appeal restored for hearing as an appeal against a refusal of entry clearance under rule 41. The crucial issue still to be determined was whether the primary purpose of the marriage was to obtain admission to the UK. If the immigration authorities concluded that Mr Hussain's assertion that he was undecided as to his long term intentions was pretended rather than genuine, clearly that would weigh against him in the primary purpose issue. That was a general possibility and there was no reason to suppose that that would be the conclusion.

NWS NWS-AL5-003 6.42 "‘The NHS is not for sale’ Virginia Bottomley talks to George Jones in her first interview since joining the Cabinet By GEORGE JONES THE NEW Health Secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, set herself an ambitious target yesterday — to ‘take the politics’ out of the National Health Service. But her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the NHS is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform, with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-1990s. Labour sought to turn the general election into a referendum on the NHS, asking voters for a mandate to reverse the changes. Mrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms — and to give doctors, nurses and managers the confidence to make them work. In her first full interview since being appointed Health Secretary, she said the election result, and Mr Major's unequivocal commitment to the NHS, had finally ‘nailed the lie’ about privatisation of health care. ‘The NHS is not for profit. It is not for sale. It will continue to be true to its founding principles, available to all and free at the point of delivery,’ she said. She recalled a promise made by Mr Major when he became Prime Minister: that he would work for a nation at ease with itself. ‘I want to see a health service at ease with itself — optimistic and confident about its essential work. Health is something which touches every individual and family in the country,’ she said. ‘But there must be changes. An organisation that doesn't change fossilises. Health needs to develop and alter.’ By next year, she is confident that two thirds of hospitals will have become self-governing trusts within the NHS. She pledged that the Government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status, but she expected this to be a minority. The Government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to ‘buy’ services for patients, and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding. The election result has given the Conservatives five years in which to press ahead with the changes. Most people are likely to judge the reforms on how long they have to wait for treatment — the issue behind the ‘Jennifer's ear’ controversy during the election campaign. Mrs Bottomley stressed her commitment to the Patient's Charter, which has already eliminated almost all waits of more than two years for NHS operations. The next step is to ensure that, from March, no one should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement or a cataract operation. A national standard will also be set for outpatient waiting times. Mrs Bottomley's first big test as Health Secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round, which will be conducted against a background of concern over high Government borrowing and pressure from the Tory Right for public spending cuts. The Conservative manifesto contained a commitment to increase, year by year, the level of ‘real resources’ committed to the NHS — though it put no figure on the extra money to be allocated. Mrs Bottomley, representing ‘caring Conservatism’, will face Mr Michael Portillo, the new Treasury Chief Secretary, who is equally keen to establish his Right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings. She acknowledged that there could be difficult times ahead. ‘It will always be the case that the holder of my office will need to fight the corner of the health service and there will always, inevitably, be more than we can do.’ But she stressed there would be no let-up in the search for greater efficiency. As well as fighting for more money, her task was to ensure that ‘every last pound’ was spent as effectively as it could be. Her priorities include giving more encouragement to medical research; emphasis on preventive health to make the NHS a ‘health as well as a sickness service’, with the publication shortly of new national targets for reducing deaths from heart disease and cancers; and pressing ahead with care in the community. As a former psychiatric social worker, Mrs Bottomley is determined to improve standards of care for mentally ill and handicapped people. ‘It is not acceptable to have people who require a home confined to long-stay institutions when they could be in more domestic settings. That is a real challenge,’ she said. Mrs Bottomley's rise to the top has been swift, with only four years between her first ministerial post and a seat at the Cabinet table. But she bridles at suggestions that the inclusion of two women — Mrs Gillian Shephard at the Department of Employment and herself — has excluded more able men from the Cabinet. ‘Prime Ministers always have to consider balance in the Cabinet — and at least we now have the same number of women as old Etonians in John Major's team,’ she said."
NWS NWS-CH3-275 5.55 "I'M DOING IT FOR YOU MICHAEL FANZINE special on the force that's driving Eubank Respect for fallen hero IAN GIBB CHRIS EUBANK couldn't help himself — the words of tribute to Michael Watson came tumbling out in a torrent, a year to the Saturday since he put the brave Londoner into a coma. Forgotten, momentarily, were the lumps and bumps and soreness of his face after the punishment he took from game but limited American challenger Tony Thornton in Glasgow on Saturday night. Today is the actual anniversary of the tragic night in Tottenham when Eubank crushed Watson — and it is only recently that the Islington fighter has started to make a real recovery. Just the mention of his name started Eubank off. ‘What a blinding man, and I'm so very pleased that Michael is seeming to make an amazing recovery. ‘I've spoken to him a few times and he's the epitome of a true warrior. He still wants to fight, believes he still has it in him to fight. ‘He's still sharp, has a sense of humour, he's witty. He's bitter about what happened — he didn't want to lose. He hated that. ‘But I got punched to pieces that night and the only reason I won the fight was that I could still keep going in the 12th round. Brilliant ‘Since that day it hasn't looked too good for Michael, certainly not five or six months ago. Now he's brilliant. He said to me: ‘Bring the championship belt and a camera.’ ‘I'd willingly give him the belt but he wouldn't take it. The difference between us is that I don't like this boxing business — and he still loves it, even now. ‘He keeps telling me that I must fight every contender and mustn't dodge anyone. He says as a champion I must perform well and give the public value for money. Then he says: ‘Are you ready for the re-match. Are you up to it?’ ‘He's still a warrior in his mind and you can't break his spirit. He will keep on trying to finish on his feet.’ Yet questions have to be asked quite seriously about whether Eubank himself can maintain his work-rate with a tenth world title fight lined up in just 24 months. He faces yet another challenge for his WBO super- middleweight crown in Manchester on November 28. But I think it's all to do with Watson, the man he now respects so much. Eubank would fight every week if he could to make his fortune secure as soon as possible. Yet on Saturday night he may have run away from a million dollar showdown with Iran Barkley, a man Nigel Benn once conquered, now the IBF champion at 12 stone. Barkley's handler, Stan Hoffman, was in Glasgow to run the rule over Eubank — and he wasn't impressed. He said: ‘I could not sell a Eubank-Barkley fight in the States after that performance. ‘All that running away in the last couple of rounds, it was crazy — an American TV audience wouldn't like it.’ Eubank's promoter Barry Hearn may have different ideas, and is thinking of trying to put Barkley on against Eubank in Britain. That's even though the British Boxing Board have already ruled out Barkley from fighting here because of eye retina damage. If that fell down Hearn might think of staging such a fight in France. But that wouldn't happen until some time next year when Eubank could also be facing Nigel Benn — especially if Benn lifts the WBC title in Italy next month. Eubank looked as though he was going to finish off Thornton in the ninth round — and should have done so in the tenth. But he admitted: ‘I couldn't stay with his pace and I had to get away and look after myself.’ Thornton was not impressed by that tactic. He said: ‘What was the speed limit in the ring during those last couple of rounds? He ran his ass off! It must be wondered whether Eubank is jaded through having so many fights at a high level in such a short time. But it won't get any easier as Hearn promises: ‘We're only going to fight sluggers and tough guys. That may sound mercenary because Chris knows the rest of his career is limited, but it will be fun for people watching! Eubank insists: ‘I HAVE to fight. I NEED to fight. I WANT to fight — on November 28. Yet even Eubank, deep down, does question his continuation in a sport that he has never really liked. He said: ‘It's nice to have a record of 33 wins in 33 fights, but in a way it is becoming tedious and I'm tired of winning all the time. ‘You can have too much of a good thing — but the alternative is quite unacceptable…defeat.’ If he keeps pushing himself so hard, that unacceptable facet of boxing might have to be faced sooner or later. Thornton wasn't quite good enough to take his title, but Eubank might soon be so tired that someone, somewhere, will catch up with him. WHAT A BELTER! STILL champ — but deep down Chris Eubank knows how close it was against punching postman Tony Thornton CHRIS makes his point to the fans EU better watch out — Thornton throws a left FLASHBACK one year — and joy that was soon to turn to despair for Eubank, with Michael Watson moments away from collapse Pictures: CHRIS GRIEVE"

There is not a day goes by that Joan does not think of her youngest child. ‘He would have been 30 now,’ she says. ‘He always wanted to be a detective when he grew up. ‘I often wonder if he would have fulfilled his dream. If he would be married now and have children. Shouting ‘But I can't picture him any other way than the little boy he was on that last day I saw him.’ Joan remembers that last morning at home with Brian as if it were yesterday. ‘I was starting to make the Sunday dinner and Brian said he was going out to play in the park. ‘I gave off to him about not brushing his hair. I can still remember standing brushing his hair and then shouting after him not to be long because his dinner would soon be ready.’ Searches What happened to Brian when he left home that day remains a mystery. His father and brothers joined police and Army in exhaustive searches of the nearby Ormeau park and river. In the week that followed before the mutilated remains of his body were found Joan lost two stone in weight. She said: ‘I couldn't eat or sleep that week. I just kept thinking who had my son? Where was he?’ It was on September 9 that a soldier on foot patrol along the Annadale Embankment pulled a sack from the River Lagan. Joan recalled what happened: ‘Apparently the soldier opened the bag and something fell out and he thought it was a paw and that somebody had thrown a dog into the river. ‘He said he did not think it was human. When he opened the bag completely he realised it was a human being. Forensic ‘I heard rumours in the street that a child's body had been found in the river and I asked the police. ‘They said they didn't think it was Brian but asked if forensic could come to take some prints from his toys and school books. ‘When they told me the body had been mutilated and burnt I didn't think it was Brian. I thought no one could do that to my youngster, and I put it out of my mind.’ The arrival of the police to her Well Street home a short time later started the nightmare which continues for Joan even today. ‘The police didn't have to tell me, I knew immediately. I was hysterical. I just couldn't understand how or why anyone would do that to my Brian. ‘He was a lovely child, a typical boy although he was fairly shy and quiet. Apparently he was unrecognisable. ‘The hand of the arm that was not hacked off was clenched and his thumb tucked inside,’ she said. ‘That's why the skin on his thumb did not burn and they were able to get the print. ‘When Brian used to watch horror movies with us and he was scared that's how he clenched his hands. He must have been really frightened when he died.’ Brian's body was so badly mutilated and charred that the pathologists could not determine the exact cause or time of death. This has added to Joan's torment over the years, along with the fact that his vicious killer or killers have not been found. ‘I don't know if he was strangled, shot or stabbed. I don't know if he was sexually assaulted and maybe died of shock. ‘It kills me to think of what he might have suffered. I would give anything to know how he died and when. ‘I don't even know if he was killed that Sunday or if he was tortured before he was murdered. He could have been crying for his mummy. Conscience ‘I pray that before I die I will know. There had to be more than one person involved. ‘Maybe one of them did not want to be involved but kept quiet because of fear. ‘Maybe now after 20 years that person may want to relieve his or her conscience and help put me and my husband out of our misery by coming forward. ‘If anyone knows anything that could help and has kept quiet for any reason, I would beg them to please come forward now.’ 20.0 LEFT: The last picture ever taken of Brian, in his scout's uniform.

Although he has agreed personal terms with Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish and been offered a lucrative four-year contract, Arsenal and Manchester United are also chasing the young star. Moran said: ‘Director Jack Walker's money has enabled the manager to put down a good foundation and if we can get Roy coming in alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, the club will really be going places.’ Deborah Wintle: It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ Nina Rowlands: ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ by JANET TANSLEY WHEN it comes to parenthood more and more women are deciding to go it alone. FOR some a broken-down relationship means they have no choice: Others simply long for motherhood without the commitment of marriage or a steady relationship. BUT what happens when the father of the child demands access? What are her or his rights? IT'S a dilemma facing more and more women. They want the baby but not the father. The reasons are many. Either the man she is with is not ready for a long-term commitment, he may be violent and she wants to keep him away from the child. Or she may simply have opted for motherhood without the father which normally completes the traditional ‘set’. Either way they are a growing group, especially on Merseyside which has many unmarried mums. Explains Deborah Wintle, an advice worker and counsellor for Liverpool One Parent Families Trust: ‘There are a number of unmarried mums on Merseyside, many of which we see coming into the Trust. ‘A lot more women are making the conscious decision not to get married, for whatever reason. They want the child but not the relationship that goes with it. ‘The way we see marriage has changed. People decide not to get married but to go ahead and have children anyway. For some the relationship has broken down, others have never been with the father. ‘But today's more liberal attitudes mean they have the freedom to do that. It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ There can be problems, women may have to work harder to maintain a standard of living, but support normally offered by the father can be obtained, says Deborah, 23, from family and friends. Deborah, from Aigburth, herself is a lone parent with a three-year-old little girl, Rebecca, so she knows the problems women face. One is if the father wants to see the child. Few women know where they stand. Says Deborah: ‘We have had women in this situation and it can be disturbing for them and the child. ‘The father may have been violent, the woman might be involved with someone else who has taken on the role of father. ‘When this happens they don't know what to do or where to go.’ We asked Liverpool-based Goldsmith Williams' solicitor Nina Roland, who writes the Echo Woman Extra's LE Law column where these women stand when it comes to the question of access. Says Nina: ‘The immediate answer is that if the couple are not married the mother has all the rights the father has none. ‘He would have to apply to the courts for any access. ‘And he certainly can't demand to see the child when and where he wants, say every weekend.’ Yet while the mother has all the rights invested in her, the courts will be amenable. Says Nina: ‘Unless there is a valid reason why the man should not see the child, then the courts will probably grant some sort of access. ‘It may be once a week or once a fortnight perhaps, but it wouldn't be a lengthy period until the baby is older and more independent. ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ But it is important that the baby doesn't become a tug of love in between two warring parents. And it is always better to settle out of court, says Nina. ‘It is far better for you, and the child, to come to an agreement outside the court system, than get involved in a legal battle. Best for child ‘If you have a good reason why you don't want the father to see your baby then you will be able to put your case to the courts. ‘At the end of the day you have got to decide what is best not just for you but for your child. ‘Remember, the new Children's Act gives them rights too and a court will usually consider that it is in the child's interest to know both parents where possible and reasonable.’ Not surprisingly, the access granted can often depend on whether the child is a girl or boy. Says Nina: ‘If it's a girl the courts often deem she needs her mum's influence. But boys are thought to need a man around …’ Deborah adds: ‘While the legal situation makes things clearer this is obviously an emotional problem and it can help to talk things through. ‘Sometimes there may be bitterness between the mother and father but we can help put things into perspective. ‘It may better if the child can get to know both parents where possible, even though many unmarried mums are happier on their own.’"
NWS NWS-K5C-044 5.77 "Bridge across Labour's class divide Should he stay or should he go? Labour needs Tom Clarke to remain shadow Scottish secretary, says Peter Jones AT least one Labour MP, and probably a few more, think that Labour leader John Smith should ditch his troubled shadow Scottish secretary Tom Clarke, who went back to work in January after a three-month illness and promptly inflicted two unnecessary controversies upon himself. That Labour MP is, however, bound to be disappointed. It is not in Smith's interests, or the Labour Party's, for Clarke to be summarily dispatched like some allegedly politically incorrect Daily Mirror employee. For the issue at stake is not necessarily whether Clarke is good or bad at his job, something which is indeed a topic of conversation among MPs, not just among the media's ‘very well-paid political hacks’, as Clydesdale MP Jimmy Hood asserted this week. It has much more to do with control of the party's thinking and its power structures; the debate about modernisation of ideology and whether or not the Scottish party should become more or less independent of the rest of the UK Labour Party. These debates, especially the ideological one, are difficult enough for Smith to manage, and they would get worse in Scotland if Clarke was put to the sword. They would also be worse than the ruckus stirred up by Clarke's remarks on firstly, the improbability of Labour being able to renationalise a privatised water industry, and secondly, the worthlessness of the Scottish financial industry. The first was a mistake which, all politicians will tell you, is easily made and relatively simple to correct with a few carefully worded statements and some abuse of the media. The second is not so easy to explain away, for it implied a fundamental incomprehension of the financial industry, many of whose 200,000 employees are Labour voters in marginal Edinburgh seats. And it is that point which has raised questions in the minds of some MPs who hitherto have been relatively happy with Clarke. Still, one bad speech does not merit a sacking. And although there are some MPs who think Clarke should go now to prevent any worse gaffes, it is only on past events rather than future possibilities that such decisions can be made. And certainly there would be the most almighty row if Clarke got the push. What was interesting about those MPs who were swift to defend him was that they come from the traditional working-class wing of the parliamentary party — people like Jimmy Hood, or Aberdeen North's Bob Hughes. Now they are the sort of MPs who are most likely to support traditional Labour policies, which Clarke, on the hypothetical question of water renationalisation, was implicitly rejecting. Clearly, on the evidence of Hood's letters of defence in the press this week, they support him, not because of what he says, but because of what he is — from, and still part of, a traditional working-class background. According to Hood, the criticisms of Clarke are ‘born from jealousy and political snobbery’. It has to be said that there has been for some years within the Labour Party something of a class divide — a working-class element resentful of a middle-class takeover by lawyers and the like. The divide has been bridged in a number of ways, one being shadow Cabinet elections putting people like Tom Clarke or John Prescott into the upper echelons. Neil Kinnock also bridged that divide, but John Smith is definably and obviously on the middle-class side of it. Smith therefore needs people like Tom Clarke in the shadow Cabinet. Turf him out of it, and the debate between ‘traditionalists’ and ‘modernisers’could well turn into a conflagration. The row over what Labour would do with the water industry is a graphic first flare-up in that debate. It is potentially hugely divisive given the Scottish party's left-wing sensibilities, but less so if working-class traditionalists like Clarke can go down Smith's route to modernity. The water debate, when couched in terms of the Scottish party's rights to determine policy in specifically Scottish areas, also directly affects the current internal demands for more Scottish party autonomy, even unto independence. This argument, that the Scottish party should elect its own leader, raise its own funds, hire and fire its own staff and sit in a Westminster coalition with the English and Welsh Labour Party, is something which acutely interests a few hundred activists, but not many MPs, and one guesses, precious few voters. But if John Smith was cavalierly hiring and firing the shadow Scottish secretary, some more MPs might start taking an interest, which would be wholly undesirable in the leader's office. So Clarke will stay. But he has done himself some damage and will need to work hard, and with some care, if he is to secure re-election to the shadow Cabinet in November. For, according to the soundings taken by The Scotsman this week, he would not win re-election now."
NWS NWS-K5C-076 5.79 "Relaxing: a vital part of a pupil's life THE sigh always comes first and it's always a loud one. The books are plonked on the table. Then the elbow joins them as the head is firmly glued to the palm of the hand; it's as if that tired old head was too heavy to hold itself up. This little drama — and other scenes like it — is played out method-acting style almost every day in this particular household. Yes, it's homework time. But the children here go to a school where a steady and regular dose of homework is the norm. At other schools and in other households, it's different. Many primary age kids are recommended by their schools to take a break from the first three R's and take up another one — relaxing. Given that the homework routine of different schools varies, what can the anxious parent do to make sure that their child is getting enough, and what do they need to know about it, if anything? Is the link between home and school strong enough and at what point do you intervene? And can a parent become involved if they are dissatisfied with the homework programme of the school? At secondary school the allocation of homework is usually uniform. There are essays to be done, maths questions to answer and a still life to be drawn at almost every school across the country. But there is no routine at primary school. Sometimes one school will have a set policy and even a policy statement on homework while another will leave it to the individual whim of the teacher. John McCabe, junior school headmaster at St Aloysius College, Glasgow, an independent school, says that homework is an integral part of what the school does. ‘It reinforces and give practice to what has been going on during the day,’ he says. ‘Primary 4 and 5 are given an average of 60 minutes conscious homework each evening. In primary 6 and 7 that goes up to one hour l5 minutes.’ Children at St Aloysius College are given a home work diary which their parents must sign every day. The diary tells the children and parents what is required to be done on any one evening. Mr McCabe says: ‘The advice to parents is if a lower school child is struggling after 45 minutes, then don't let them continue. The teacher will look at the problem the next morning.’ The school believes their homework scheme is very successful. They say that parents who pay for their children's education expect them to be given homework. ‘It means children acquire a serious attitude to their school work and it's a good habit,’ says Mr McCabe. ‘It makes them more responsible for their own work and gets them into the idea that they have to work outside normal school hours. They acquire the habit of studying and that is worthwhile.’ However, this very stringent pattern of homework is not one that many other state schools with primary age children adhere to. At a non-denominational school in the west end of Glasgow a head teacher explained that the maximum time to be spent on homework was half an hour. ‘We are of the opinion that if a child is working hard in school they really should be relaxing and doing other things out of it,’ she said. But what if the parent is not happy with this and believes that their child really ought to be doing more homework? ‘It is the school policy. Parents looking for advice on what to do to help with their child's education will be told that the most important thing is to spend quality time talking to their children,’ the West End headteacher said. She advises worried parents to take their children out to museums, the theatre and cinema, and to make sure that they are getting plenty of interaction with other children. She adds: ‘Talking to children is the biggest advantage.’ At Sciennes primary in Edinburgh, head teacher Maureen Pollock tends to agree. She says that her teachers are keen to make sure that all work should match individual children's needs. Parents are given a school booklet, part of which outlines the school's policy on homework. ‘A child's formal education stops at the end of each school day but education continues at all times,’ it says. ‘It is important that children have time to play, pursue interests and hobbies and take part in informal organised activities with other children and alone. For this reason we do not believe in formal homework on a regular basis.’ At Sciennes, homework is phased in as children approach high school age. Children from Primary 3 upwards do have diaries to keep parents informed if there has been any homework set — but is rarely any until Primary 7 age. Different schools have different policies and different children have different homework. What becomes clear is that a parent must listen to the individual school's advice on what they see as the best sort of homework to give and in what amounts. Homework should not be used as a means of controlling children but as a key to the development to their education. And if a school feels that adding that fourth R to the old reading, writing, arithmetic routine then it seems a parent shouldn't expect more. Audrey Gillan"
